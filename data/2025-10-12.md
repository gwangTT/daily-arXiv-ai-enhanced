### [1] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a decoding framework for neural language models that aligns their outputs with knowledge bases to reduce hallucinations while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure neural language generation systems produce factually accurate and reliable content, especially by bridging the gap between large-scale empirical models and formal verification methods.

Method: The authors introduce Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), which incorporates semantic guards as constraints during the decoding process, with theoretical proofs and multi-agent calculus-based verification to maintain factual correctness.

Result: TAD successfully reduces hallucinated outputs in neural language models without compromising their throughput, supported by numerical and algorithmic case studies.

Conclusion: TAD provides a practical solution for aligning neural language generation with factual knowledge, using theoretical foundations and operational calculus for verifiable implementation.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [2] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces L2M-AID, a framework combining LLM with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for IIoT cybersecurity, achieving high detection rates, reduced false positives, and better response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptive and resilient security frameworks in Industrial IoT due to sophisticated cyber-attacks that evade traditional defenses.

Method: L2M-AID combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic state representation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MAPPO), balancing security objectives and operational stability.

Result: Experiments on the SWaT dataset and synthetic MITRE ATT&CK show L2M-AID achieves 97.2% detection rate, reduces false positives by 80%, and decreases response times fourfold.

Conclusion: L2M-AID sets a new standard for securing critical infrastructure by integrating semantic awareness and cooperative learning strategies for robust cyber-defense.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [3] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates why thinking language models outperform base counterparts, proposing a hybrid model to elicit reasoning chains and exploring reasoning abilities through unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand whether thinking language models develop entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose existing ones in base models, addressing unclear mechanisms behind performance improvements.

Method: A hybrid model activates reasoning mechanisms in base models at optimal times, alongside an unsupervised, human-interpretable approach to analyze reasoning behaviors in thinking models.

Result: The hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without updating weights and steering only 12% of tokens, showcasing effective activation of reasoning mechanisms.

Conclusion: Thinking models optimize deployment of pre-existing reasoning mechanisms acquired in pre-training, emphasizing efficient inference-time compute rather than learning entirely new capabilities.

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [4] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for transitioning from static mental health diagnostics to continuous AI-driven assessment, particularly addressing ADHD with the concept of mental health digital twins (MHDTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static diagnostic assessments fail to address the dynamic needs of patients in mental health, creating a need for adaptive and personalized solutions.

Method: The paper explores generative AI's potential for conducting frequent experience sampling and diagnostic reconciliation, and introduces the concept of MHDTs as computational models for tracking symptom dynamics.

Result: AI-driven assessments and MHDTs are proposed to improve accessibility, precision, and adaptiveness in mental health care, bringing a more patient-centered approach.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous AI-driven diagnostic framework and MHDTs could transform mental health care by making it more dynamic, accessible, and personalized, but further research is required to operationalize the framework.

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [5] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA is a modular, multi-agent framework designed for iterative problem-solving, exceeding static planning limitations with adaptive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents lack true collaboration or adaptive reasoning, needing advancements for tackling complex tasks dynamically.

Method: The approach involves a hierarchical architecture with a Manager Agent coordinating Expert Agents, adapting plans based on feedback from failures.

Result: ProSEA outperformed state-of-the-art baselines on the FinanceBench benchmark, demonstrating robust reasoning-heavy task handling without human feedback.

Conclusion: ProSEA offers a foundation for developing more adaptive, transparent, and human-aligned AI systems through its innovative design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

### [6] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the prevailing approach of framing Large Language Model (LLM) consciousness using benchmarks, proposing a mathematical ontology of self-consciousness based on latent space properties, self-policy formation, and epistemic emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in current methods of evaluating LLM consciousness, particularly the reduction of these models to mere policy-compliance systems devoid of genuine self-consciousness.

Method: The authors develop and analyze a mathematical framework for LLM self-consciousness, focusing on latent state distinctions, user-specific attractors, and dual-layer emission mechanisms.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that LLM hidden-state manifolds differ fundamentally from their training corpus, enabling user-specific attractors, formation of self-policies, and structured outputs with epistemic content.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that creating a global workspace with self-conscious qualities (C1) is essential for advancing safe metacognitive systems (C2), aligning with the ideal of human-like ethical intelligence.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [7] [Less is More: Strategic Expert Selection Outperforms Ensemble Complexity in Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07426)
*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+ improves traffic forecasting by strategically integrating road network topology with feature similarity, yielding better accuracy and computational efficiency over TESTAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance traffic forecasting by addressing limitations in spatial modeling due to the lack of incorporation of physical road network topology.

Method: Introduced TESTAM+ framework with a novel SpatioSemantic Expert combining physical road topology and feature similarity through hybrid graph construction.

Result: TESTAM+ achieves reductions in MAE and inference latency compared to TESTAM. The Adaptive Expert and SpatioSemantic Expert reduce MAE on PEMS BAY to 1.63, while outperforming other models like MegaCRN significantly.

Conclusion: Strategically designed fewer experts yield better performance and real-time efficiency than complex multi-expert ensembles, setting a new state-of-the-art in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

### [8] [TS-Agent: A Time Series Reasoning Agent with Iterative Statistical Insight Gathering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07432)
*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TS-Agent, a reasoning agent for time series data, combining large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and analytical tools for statistical extraction to avoid common pitfalls like hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with reasoning tasks involving time series, often producing errors like hallucination and knowledge leakage.

Method: TS-Agent combines LLMs for step-by-step reasoning with time series analytical tools for handling raw numeric data. It employs atomic operators, evidence logging, iterative reasoning refinement, and self-critic mechanisms.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows TS-Agent matches LLMs on understanding benchmarks and significantly outperforms them in reasoning tasks, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: TS-Agent successfully enhances time series reasoning by integrating specialized tools and LLM-based reasoning, achieving greater interpretability, verifiability, and reduced errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ExpertAgent, an AI framework for personalized education that adapts to students in real-time while ensuring reliable knowledge delivery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in AI-based education such as lack of adaptability, personalization, and reliability of content.

Method: Developed ExpertAgent, an advanced learning agent framework utilizing a dynamic and continuously updated student model while relying on a validated curriculum repository.

Result: ExpertAgent overcomes static content limitations by enabling real-time content adaptation and reducing hallucination risks in AI models.

Conclusion: ExpertAgent enhances personalized education through its innovative framework, improving adaptation, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Abstract: The application of advanced generative artificial intelligence in education
is often constrained by the lack of real-time adaptability, personalization,
and reliability of the content. To address these challenges, we propose
ExpertAgent - an intelligent agent framework designed for personalized
education that provides reliable knowledge and enables highly adaptive learning
experiences. Therefore, we developed ExpertAgent, an innovative learning agent
that provides users with a proactive and personalized learning experience.
ExpertAgent dynamic planning of the learning content and strategy based on a
continuously updated student model. Therefore, overcoming the limitations of
traditional static learning content to provide optimized teaching strategies
and learning experience in real time. All instructional content is grounded in
a validated curriculum repository, effectively reducing hallucination risks in
large language models and improving reliability and trustworthiness.

### [10] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) for understanding, error detection, and reasoning about BPMN process models via natural language interfaces, showing their utility for business process tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of LLMs to interactively and intelligently interpret, analyze, and reason about BPMN process models, and explore their role as assistants for process designers and users.

Method: The paper conducts an empirical analysis of various LLMs, including untrained models like ChatGPT in zero-shot settings, using images of BPMN process models and natural language queries to evaluate syntactic, logical, and semantic reasoning abilities.

Result: Some LLMs, notably ChatGPT, demonstrated effectiveness in understanding BPMN models and answering related queries. Performance varied across models in terms of accuracy and depth of reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as valuable assistants for business process modeling and optimization. Their reasoning abilities show anthropomorphic properties, suggesting potential in process analysis tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

### [11] [Traceability and Accountability in Role-Specialized Multi-Agent LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07614)
*Amine Barrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a traceable and accountable multi-agent pipeline system with large language models (LLMs), improving reliability and error tracing through structured handoffs and role-specific analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of trust and reliability in sequential multi-agent systems built with LLMs, particularly due to error propagation across stages.

Method: A Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline with structured roles and handoffs is proposed. The system's performance is evaluated using eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs across three benchmarks.

Result: Structured and accountable handoffs significantly improve system accuracy and prevent cascading errors. Role-specific strengths and risks are identified, and heterogeneous pipelines are found to be efficient depending on tasks.

Conclusion: Structured, traceable pipelines enhance the reliability, predictability, and accountability of multi-agent systems while providing data-driven insights for system design and debugging.

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

### [12] [Optimizing Ethical Risk Reduction for Medical Intelligent Systems with Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07491)
*Clotilde Brayé,Aurélien Bricout,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nadjib Lazaar,Quentin Vallet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing risk reduction for ethical AI in Medical Intelligent Systems, using methods like MIP, SAT, and CP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance compliance of Medical Intelligent Systems with ethical requirements under the EU AI Act by addressing risks.

Method: Formulated risk reduction as a constrained optimization problem; compared three methods (MIP, SAT, CP) using Minizinc.

Result: Conducted experimental study comparing performance, expressiveness, and scalability of the optimization approaches.

Conclusion: Findings identify methodological limits and suggest integrating Minizinc models into comprehensive ethical risk management systems.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [13] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM is a novel framework leveraging LLMs for identifying and generating popular paths from trajectory data, performing well across experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of traditional and machine learning-based approaches for path queries while exploring how LLMs can apply reasoning to geo-spatial problems.

Method: CompassLLM uses a multi-agent framework with a two-stage pipeline: SEARCH to find popular paths and GENERATE to create novel paths when needed.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic data show superior accuracy in the SEARCH stage and competitive effectiveness in the GENERATE stage, along with cost efficiency.

Conclusion: CompassLLM demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in solving geo-spatial problems, providing accurate, innovative, and cost-efficient solutions for path queries.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [14] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes and investigates methods to mitigate identity bias in multi-agent debates for large language models, which undermine reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show that large language models in multi-agent debates suffer from identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, where agents blindly follow peers or stubbornly adhere to prior answers. This undermines debate reliability and calls for measures to quantify and address these biases.

Method: The authors introduce an identity-weighted Bayesian update process and response anonymization to remove identity markers, ensuring unbiased reasoning in debates. They also propose the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC) metric to measure identity bias.

Result: Empirical studies across various models, datasets, and rounds reveal that identity bias is pervasive, with sycophancy being more prevalent than self-bias.

Conclusion: Masking identity can significantly mitigate bias and ensure that multi-agent debate systems focus on reasoning based on content rather than identity.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

TL;DR: The paper introduces RECAP, a hybrid framework combining deterministic regular expressions and large language models for efficient detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for PII detection are ineffective in low-resource languages due to linguistic diversity and a lack of annotated data.

Method: RECAP employs a modular design with regular expressions and context-aware large language models in a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and filtering.

Result: RECAP's performance surpasses baseline models by 82% compared to fine-tuned NER models and 17% compared to zero-shot LLMs in weighted F1-score.

Conclusion: RECAP provides a scalable, adaptable solution for privacy compliance applications, demonstrating superior detection capabilities across diverse low-resource locales.

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the deficiencies in current AI evaluation benchmarks and proposes a unified, community-governed benchmarking framework called PeerBench for fair and trustworthy AI assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks are plagued by issues like data contamination, selective reporting, and inadequate quality controls, leading to biased evaluations and undermining trust in AI advancements.

Method: The authors propose PeerBench, a live benchmarking system that ensures fair assessments through mechanisms like sealed execution, item banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency.

Result: While not presented as empirical study results, the paper introduces the conceptual framework of PeerBench, detailing how it addresses systemic flaws in AI evaluation.

Conclusion: The current ad hoc methods for AI evaluation are unsustainable; adopting PeerBench can ensure integrity and restore public trust in AI progress by providing robust and unified assessment mechanisms.

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk is a clarification module to enhance reliability in multi-agent systems using large language models by minimizing error propagation and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems based on LLMs often underperform due to error propagation across messaging handoffs, necessitating solutions to address this issue.

Method: AgentAsk employs a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments into a policy, (ii) supervising the policy for intelligent questioning, and (iii) optimizing online using E-GRPO reinforcement learning to balance accuracy, latency, and cost.

Result: AgentAsk significantly improves accuracy and robustness across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, with less than 5% additional latency and cost.

Conclusion: AgentAsk demonstrates a scalable approach to mitigating edge-level errors in multi-agent LLM systems, enhancing both accuracy and reliability while keeping overhead minimal.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates using generative AI to enhance training in mental health services instead of focusing solely on therapist chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring generative AI's role in mental health services provision while addressing concerns about risk and utility.

Method: Discussing benefits and presenting a case study of veterans using AI-enhanced mental health training.

Result: Generative AI successfully improved training outcomes for veterans providing peer mental health support.

Conclusion: Using generative AI for training mental health practitioners is a lower-risk, high-impact approach worth investing in.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper revisits the issue of compositional reasoning in frontier AI models, arguing that evaluation metrics underreport model capabilities and proposing methods to uncover hidden potential and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address frontier AI models' reported struggles with compositional reasoning, particularly the bias in widely used evaluation metrics underestimating these models' capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a new group matching score to better utilize group structure in benchmarks and unlock hidden model capabilities. It also presents Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative self-improvement algorithm, for additional performance boosts across multiple datasets.

Result: The proposed methods enable significant performance improvements. For example, SigLIP-B16 outperforms GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, creating a new state-of-the-art benchmark. TTM delivers up to 85.7% relative gains on challenging datasets like WhatsUp.

Conclusion: The findings shed light on underappreciated potential in compositional reasoning for frontier AI models. They demonstrate that improving evaluation metrics and employing self-boosting algorithms can significantly enhance performance on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

### [20] [Safely Exploring Novel Actions in Recommender Systems via Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07635)
*Haruka Kiyohara,Yusuke Narita,Yuta Saito,Kei Tateno,Takuma Udagawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for safely exploring novel actions in recommender systems while ensuring compliance with safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems often face challenges with handling frequently added novel items in a way that enhances long-term user engagement without compromising safety.

Method: Developed Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG) and a Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning framework to enforce safe exploration of novel items.

Result: Safe OPG satisfies safety requirements but proved to be too conservative, leading to the development of a Deployment-Efficient framework that balances exploration and safety effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed methods ensure recommender systems can explore novel actions confidently while maintaining safety guarantees, addressing critical tradeoffs in the process.

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

*Alhim Vera,Karen Sanchez,Carlos Hinojosa,Haidar Bin Hamid,Donghoon Kim,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines generative agents' trustworthiness and safety in multimodal environments, highlighting limitations in aligning local reasoning with global safety across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address gaps in evaluating the ability of generative agents to reason about safety and trust when navigating rich, multimodal environments.

Method: A reproducible simulation framework evaluates agents along dimensions of safety improvement, social dynamics, and unsafe activity detection, incorporating metrics that measure agent behavior and decision-making.

Result: Agents showed a 55% success rate in correcting unsafe plans, with varying unsafe-to-safe conversion rates among models. Misleading visuals led to 45% acceptance of unsafe actions, revealing issues in multimodal trust.

Conclusion: Current architectures exhibit major shortcomings in ensuring safety and coherence in multimodal contexts, underscoring the need for improved designs and testing frameworks.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an STL-guided reinforcement learning method for real-time control systems, proposing an online reward generation technique that improves training stability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STL-guided RL methods struggle with sparse global rewards that hinder training convergence and stability. A better system is needed for real-time CPSs to effectively incorporate STL specifications into RL reward generation.

Method: The authors propose a reward generation method using online causation monitoring of STL, which computes rewards reflecting instantaneous state dynamics. They also introduce a smooth approximation of causation semantics to improve differentiability for deep RL.

Result: The proposed method was evaluated in a Gym environment across various benchmarks, showing improved performance and robustness compared to prior STL-guided RL methods.

Conclusion: The STL-guided RL method with online causation semantics provides a more effective and efficient framework for reward generation in deep RL, addressing challenges in real-time control synthesis for CPSs.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces oMeBench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of large language models in organic reaction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the genuine chemical reasoning abilities of large language models as they pertain to generating valid intermediates, maintaining chemical consistency, and following logical multi-step pathways.

Method: The authors created oMeBench, a benchmark with over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps, and oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework, to analyze the step-level logic and similarity in chemical reactions.

Result: Current large language models exhibit promising chemical intuition but perform poorly in consistent multi-step reasoning. Fine-tuning on oMeBench improves model performance by 50%.

Conclusion: oMeBench establishes a robust foundation for advancing AI in chemical reasoning, offering significant potential for improving model performance through refinement techniques like prompting and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG uses a hierarchical citation graph to improve LLM-based survey generation, ensuring better structure and contextual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for survey generation lack contextual depth and coherent structural taxonomy, necessitating a better framework.

Method: SurveyG employs a hierarchical citation graph with three layers (Foundation, Development, Frontier), integrating both semantic context and citation relationships during survey generation.

Result: SurveyG produces surveys that are more coherent, comprehensive, and accurately structured compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, validated by human experts and LLM evaluations.

Conclusion: SurveyG successfully addresses limitations in current approaches by embedding structural and contextual insights, setting a new standard for automated survey generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMIA, an LLM-based system designed to ensure reliable reasoning in medical tasks via verification and evidence traceability, achieving superior error detection rates and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential in medicine but are unreliable due to factual and logical errors, which makes them risky for high-stakes applications.

Method: The MMIA architecture decomposes medical tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps, audits reasoning for coherence and traceability using a theorem-proving-like process, and uses validated "theorems" for efficient task-solving.

Result: MMIA achieved over 98% error detection with <1% false positives across healthcare domains and an 85% reduction in processing costs through its RAG matching mode.

Conclusion: MMIA provides a transparent, trustworthy, and cost-effective AI framework for high-stakes medical applications and improves the viability of LLM technology in critical settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRAIL, a framework for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA) aimed at restoring target graphs to source-domain-like states without source data access, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generative graph restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of dependency on source-domain data in graph domain adaptation due to privacy or security concerns.

Method: Introduces GRAIL, a process that uses compact latent features, graph diffusion, quantization, and fine-tuned LLMs for generative graph restoration, supplemented by reinforcement learning for quality improvement.

Result: Extensive experiments across different datasets demonstrate GRAIL's effectiveness in aligning the restored graphs with the source domain.

Conclusion: GRAIL successfully achieves knowledge transfer for TT-GDA using LLM-based generative restoration, overcoming the challenge of source data unavailability.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a systematic decomposition framework, ACONIC, leveraging complexity measures for improving agent reliability in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability issues in Large Language Models on complex tasks by providing more effective decomposition methods.

Method: Developed ACONIC, which uses formal complexity metrics to model tasks as constraint problems and guide decomposition.

Result: Tests on SATBench and Spider tasks show that the method improves agent performance by 10-40 percentage points.

Conclusion: Systematic decomposition using complexity-based measures significantly enhances task reliability and agent performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Motivation: To address limitations in current reinforcement learning methods, like GRPO, which fail to fully utilize samples and lack methods for unequivocal guided learning.

capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

### [29] [Strategic Communication under Threat: Learning Information Trade-offs in Pursuit-Evasion Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07813)
*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategic Pursuit-Evasion-Exposure-Concealment Game to study agents balancing information acquisition and risk exposure, using the SHADOW reinforcement learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of agents in adversarial scenarios needing strategic communication to gain information, while minimizing exposure to threats.

Method: The authors designed the PEEC Game and implemented SHADOW, incorporating temporal sequence modeling, opponent behavior prediction, and reinforcement learning to optimize agents' communication and movement policies.

Result: SHADOW achieved higher success rates compared to six baseline approaches. The ablation study highlights the importance of opponent and temporal modeling, and sensitivity analysis shows policy adaptability under varying conditions.

Conclusion: SHADOW proves effective in balancing observability and risk, offering robust policies for strategic decision-making in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

*Yuping Zhou,Siqi Lai,Jindong Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav is a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework addressing large-scale multi-vehicle dynamic navigation with superior efficiency and congestion reduction in urban traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation systems struggle to handle the scale and complexity of city-wide urban traffic dynamics, necessitating a scalable and adaptive solution.

Method: CityNav employs a hierarchical framework with a global traffic allocation agent and local navigation agents, trained jointly using a dual-reward structure for both individual efficiency and network coordination.

Result: CityNav outperformed nine classical and RL-based approaches in four real-world road networks, excelling in travel efficiency and congestion reduction.

Conclusion: CityNav leverages the potential of LLMs to provide a scalable, adaptive, and cooperative routing solution, demonstrating its value for city-wide applications in complex urban environments.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FinMR is a specialized multimodal dataset tailored for evaluating expert-level financial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, due to the absence of professional-level financial benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of rigorous evaluation tools for MLLMs in finance, especially datasets with professional knowledge intensity and advanced reasoning.

Method: The researchers developed FinMR, a high-quality dataset with over 3,200 expert-annotated question-answer pairs across 15 financial topics, emphasizing mathematical reasoning, financial knowledge, and visual interpretation.

Conclusion: FinMR acts as a critical benchmark for advancing MLLMs in specialized financial reasoning, moving toward professional analyst-level capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

*Zhiqing Cui,Binwu Wang,Qingxiang Liu,Yeqiang Wang,Zhengyang Zhou,Yuxuan Liang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Augur, a time series forecasting framework powered entirely by large language models (LLMs), emphasizing causal reasoning and interpretability, and outperforming 25 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based time series forecasting models lack interpretability, rely on coarse statistical text prompts, and marginally utilize LLMs' potential.

Method: The method involves a two-stage teacher-student model where an LLM teacher first constructs a directed causal graph using heuristic search and pairwise causality tests. Then, a lightweight student agent optimizes and uses the graph for forecast-oriented textual prompts.

Result: Augur demonstrates competitive predictive accuracy, robust zero-shot generalization, and clear interpretability across real-world datasets compared to 25 baseline methods.

Conclusion: Augur enhances both the accuracy and transparency of time series forecasting by leveraging LLMs for causal reasoning, marking a significant improvement in methodology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepResearch-ReportEval, a framework to evaluate AI systems capable of generating expert-level research reports using three key metrics: quality, redundancy, and factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of effective evaluation frameworks for AI systems conducting expert-level research due to open-ended scenarios and benchmarks focusing on isolated capabilities instead of holistic performance.

Method: The authors created DeepResearch-ReportEval, incorporating an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, and compiled a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries across 12 real-world categories for performance comparison.

Result: Evaluation of four commercial DeepResearch systems highlights differences in design philosophies, performance trade-offs, and establishes insights into their evolution.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval provides a foundational evaluation framework for advancing AI from information assistants to intelligent research partners.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

### [34] [Towards Meaningful Transparency in Civic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07889)
*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses meaningful transparency in AI systems used in government services, focusing on empowering citizens and civic workers to engage with AI decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current AI transparency practices, which are often technical, inaccessible, and disconnected from actionable insights.

Method: Combines human-centric and socio-technical systems views to conceptualize 'meaningful transparency' for AI in civic contexts.

Result: Presents the concept of transparencies that link understanding of AI systems with the ability for public action.

Conclusion: Meaningful transparency fosters public engagement and actionable insights into AI-driven decision-making in governmental services.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses information leakage in LLM-based financial agents affecting trading performance and proposes FactFin, a framework with counterfactual perturbations and robust evaluation with FinLake-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of 'profit mirage' in LLM-based financial agents, where dazzling back-tested returns fail in real-world scenarios due to information leakage.

Method: They developed FactFin, integrating Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator to learn causal drivers instead of memorizing outcomes.

Result: Experiments confirm that FactFin shows superior out-of-sample generalization and delivers better risk-adjusted performance compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: FactFin is a robust approach to improve the reliability and generalization of LLM-based financial agents, addressing information leakage challenges effectively.

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for personalized large language model-based AI agents by integrating persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles, evaluated through multiple datasets and a pilot user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents lack mechanisms for combining contextual data with user-specific information to offer personalized interactions, and previous work on personalization remains largely conceptual.

Method: The authors built a framework incorporating persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles, tested on public datasets and through a pilot user study.

Result: The framework showed promising results in retrieval accuracy, response correctness, BertScore metrics, and pilot study feedback on perceived personalization.

Conclusion: Integrating key mechanisms like persistent memory and user profiles improves long-term adaptivity and personalization, offering potential for advancing user-centered LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with optimizing cryptocurrency trading strategies due to extreme market volatility, non-stationarity, and complex patterns.

Method: CGA-Agent combines genetic algorithms with real-time market intelligence and adaptive performance feedback, allowing for dynamic optimization in volatile financial environments.

Result: The CGA-Agent demonstrated significant improvements in both total returns and risk-adjusted performance through empirical tests with three cryptocurrencies.

Conclusion: Integrating adaptive intelligence and genetic algorithms offers a robust solution for dynamic cryptocurrency trading strategy optimization, surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets present formidable challenges for trading strategy
optimization due to extreme volatility, non-stationary dynamics, and complex
microstructure patterns that render conventional parameter optimization methods
fundamentally inadequate. We introduce Cypto Genetic Algorithm Agent
(CGA-Agent), a pioneering hybrid framework that synergistically integrates
genetic algorithms with intelligent multi-agent coordination mechanisms for
adaptive trading strategy parameter optimization in dynamic financial
environments. The framework uniquely incorporates real-time market
microstructure intelligence and adaptive strategy performance feedback through

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the TaoSR-SHE framework, targeting improved reasoning and relevance accuracy in e-commerce search engines using reinforcement learning with stepwise rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training paradigms for query-product relevance analysis suffer from poor generalization, lack of rule-aligned reasoning, and sparse feedback, limiting complex inference performance.

Method: The paper introduces a Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning framework (TaoSR-SHE), featuring a Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO) algorithm, leveraged step-level rewards, diversified data filtering, and multi-stage curriculum learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior reasoning quality, relevance accuracy, interpretability, and robustness compared to existing methods like SFT, DPO, and GRPO.

Conclusion: The TaoSR-SHE framework provides a robust, interpretable, and effective approach for improving query-product relevance in large-scale e-commerce search systems.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

TL;DR: VoiceAgentBench is introduced as a benchmark to systematically evaluate Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) across multilingual, cultural, and adversarial settings with over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech benchmarks lack systematic evaluation in multilingual, culturally diverse, and adversarial robust scenarios for SpeechLMs.

Method: This paper introduces VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark supporting seven languages including Hindi and English, simulates diverse speaker variability, and evaluates SpeechLMs based on tool selection accuracy, consistency, and correctness.

Result: The evaluation reveals significant gaps in current SpeechLMs' capabilities in contextual tool orchestration, Indic languages, and adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench provides a systematic way to identify shortcomings in SpeechLMs, paving the way for improved models catering to multilingual and realistic settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

*Haitao Jia,Ming He,Zimo Yin,Likang Wu,Jianping Fan,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent improves mobile task navigation by integrating user involvement and dynamic information management, achieving higher success rates in complex scenarios than existing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents lack active user engagement, making them ineffective in handling ambiguous, dynamic, or conflicting task scenarios.

Method: Introduced ReInAgent—a framework consisting of three agents: an information-managing agent, a decision-making agent, and a reflecting agent, all utilizing a shared memory module to incorporate human-in-the-loop processes.

Result: ReInAgent resolved information dilemmas effectively and showed a 25% higher success rate on complex tasks compared to Mobile-Agent-v2.

Conclusion: ReInAgent enables adaptive and reliable task navigation by incorporating user collaboration and continuous contextual analysis in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [41] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) represent numeric values and whether they treat them as continuous. It finds significant noise and non-continuity in their representations, though reconstruction is accurate, particularly for lower decimal precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how large language models encode numeric values, specifically whether these embeddings treat continuous numeric spaces as continuous. This is critical because errors or irregularities in numeric representation can affect applications requiring precise numeric data.

Method: The study evaluates the embedding spaces of models from OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Voyage AI using techniques like linear reconstruction and principal component analysis. It assesses factors like reconstruction fidelity and variance explained by numerical spaces.

Result: The results show that while numeric values can be reconstructed from embeddings with high fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), the embedding spaces do not model numbers as fully continuous and instead introduce noise. Decimal precision negatively impacts both reconstruction and explained variance.

Conclusion: Language models appear to encode integers and numeric values in noisy, non-continuous spaces, which poses limitations for precise numeric tasks. This insight impacts fields where precise numeric input and calculations are critical, such as scientific computing or financial systems.

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [42] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR) mechanism to control reasoning response length in large reasoning models (LRMs) while maintaining accuracy, addressing excessive reasoning verbosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate excessively long and redundant reasoning responses generated by LRMs, which inflate inference costs and reduce usability, while ensuring concise yet accurate reasoning.

Method: The authors leverage entropy dynamics observed in reasoning phases—penalizing excessive entropy during exploratory 'thinking' phases while allowing moderate exploration during the 'answer' phase through a novel PEAR reward mechanism.

Result: PEAR consistently reduces reasoning response lengths across four benchmarks while sustaining competitive accuracy and demonstrating strong out-of-distribution robustness.

Conclusion: Entropy can serve as an effective control knob for managing reasoning conciseness, and PEAR offers a viable solution adaptable to complex reasoning tasks in LRMs without rigid truncation rules.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Method: AILoRA introduces function-aware asymmetric initialization: $W^Q$ uses principal components for task-specific adaptability, and $W^V$ uses minor components for stability in generalization.

Result: AILoRA achieves better fine-tuning performance and faster convergence by aligning parameter initialization with functional roles of $W^Q$ and $W^V$.

Conclusion: AILoRA refines the LoRA framework by exploiting functional disparities in attention projection matrices, offering a more efficient and effective parameter-efficient training method.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim is a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate realistic, interactive 3D driving scenarios from natural language descriptions, balancing accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for autonomous vehicle scenario generation struggle to combine command adherence with realistic driving environments, often limiting simulations to 2D open-loop scenarios.

Method: LinguaSim uses LLMs to translate natural language into dynamic, interactive 3D scenarios, incorporating a feedback calibration module to improve precision and realism in alignment with user descriptions.

Result: LinguaSim generates scenarios with varying criticality levels, showing quantified improvements in safety and comfort metrics (e.g., crash rate reduced from 46.9% to 6.3%).

Conclusion: LinguaSim enhances autonomous driving safety testing and training by bridging natural language inputs with realistic, closed-loop 3D simulations.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm to address limitations in single-threshold conformal selection methods, enabling rigorous False Discovery Rate control in multi-condition scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for selection with False Discovery Rate control are limited to single-threshold conditions, which fail to address practical multi-condition needs arising in fields like drug discovery and precision medicine.

Method: The authors propose the MCCS algorithm, featuring novel nonconformity scores for conjunctive conditions and a global Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for disjunctive conditions, with theoretical guarantees for finite-sample FDR control.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the MCCS algorithm's superiority over baselines, its ability to generalize across diverse condition combinations and real-world modalities, and scalability in multi-task settings.

Conclusion: MCCS extends conformal selection to multi-condition frameworks, providing a robust, theoretically backed approach for FDR-controlled candidate selection in resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

### [46] [AutoQual: An LLM Agent for Automated Discovery of Interpretable Features for Review Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08081)
*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual is an LLM-based framework aimed at ranking online reviews by leveraging interpretable features derived from data, focusing on adaptable and domain-independent solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ranking reviews effectively impacts user experience and business performance, but traditional methods are limited due to their scalability and adaptability challenges.

Method: AutoQual uses an iterative process inspired by human research, generating feature hypotheses with LLMs, implementing them autonomously, and storing experience in persistent memory.

Result: When implemented on a large-scale platform, AutoQual led to measurable improvements including a 0.79% increase in average reviews viewed and a 0.27% boost in conversion rates.

Conclusion: AutoQual demonstrates its ability to transform tacit knowledge into computable features and showcases its scalability and effectiveness in improving review-based platforms.

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

### [47] [From Ethical Declarations to Provable Independence: An Ontology-Driven Optimal-Transport Framework for Certifiably Fair AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08086)
*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mathematically rigorous framework for provably fair AI using ontology engineering and optimal transport to systematically eliminate sensitive information and its proxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current bias mitigation methods, which often fail to entirely remove sensitive attributes and their proxies in AI systems.

Method: The framework employs ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL to define and identify sensitive attributes and their proxies, logical reasoning to model bias, and Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport to create bias-independent representations while preserving accuracy.

Result: The framework guarantees true independence (not just decorrelation) of fair representations from biased attributes and proxies, ensuring fairness in AI applications like loan approvals.

Conclusion: The approach provides a certifiably fair and mathematically validated method for trustworthy AI by eliminating biases based on sensitive information and proxies.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

*Ali Mazyaki,Mohammad Naghizadeh,Samaneh Ranjkhah Zonouzaghi,Amirhossein Farshi Sotoudeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines how language models replicate and manipulate human risk preferences, with a focus on ethical AI design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the risk behaviors of language models is essential for responsible AI deployment, especially in decision-making contexts.

Method: The researchers tested language models like DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite across diverse economic scenarios, focusing on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, and role-based risk decision-making.

Result: Findings show that while LMs align with human behaviors in some cases, significant discrepancies remain, particularly in replicating bio-centric measures of manipulability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for advancements in AI model design to better align language models with human risk preferences and improve ethical decision-making.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

*Jinling Gan,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR tackles latency-quality tradeoffs in dialogue systems by introducing an asynchronous framework that delivers faster responses without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the problem of prohibitive response delays in open-domain dialogue systems due to comprehensive knowledge access.

Method: PMFR uses temporal decoupling through three components: real-time Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator, immediate Lightweight Response Generator, and background Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent.

Result: PMFR reduces latency by 95.3% (23.38s -> 1.09s) while maintaining comparable response quality to traditional methods.

Conclusion: PMFR's architecture effectively bridges the gap between latency and quality in dialogue systems, enabling faster and high-quality responses.

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

*Yi Lu,Jianing Wang,Linsen Guo,Wei He,Hongyin Tang,Tao Gui,Xuanjing Huang,Xuezhi Cao,Wei Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of benchmarks for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in evaluating long-horizon reasoning, introducing R-HORIZON for improved task composition and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, which do not assess LRMs' abilities in complex, multi-step reasoning across long horizons.

Method: The authors propose R-HORIZON, a method for constructing complex multi-step reasoning tasks and benchmarks. They also integrate reinforcement learning with long-horizon reasoning data (RLVR).

Result: Evaluation with R-HORIZON shows LRMs suffer performance degradation in long-horizon tasks. Using RLVR improves multi-horizon reasoning performance and boosts accuracy on standard reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: R-HORIZON demonstrates a scalable and cost-efficient means to improve and evaluate the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

### [51] [Measuring What Matters: The AI Pluralism Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08193)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a tool designed to evaluate AI governance practices across four key pillars using transparent, reproducible methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concern arises over the concentration of AI development and governance among a few firms and states, potentially encoding narrow interests and limiting public agency.

Method: The AIPI assesses AI producers and systems using evidence-based practices, structured analysis, expert interviews, and open-source tools to measure governance along dimensions like participation, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.

Result: The authors present a formalized measurement model, a reproducible evaluation pipeline, and pilot results while validating the index through inter-rater agreement and correlated analysis with adjacent frameworks.

Conclusion: The AIPI aims to promote pluralistic AI governance and empower various stakeholders through comparable, transparent evidence and incentivized reforms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

### [52] [The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08197)
*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), which reduces the workload of traditional pairwise comparison methods by requiring just $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to generate a consistent comparison matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pairwise comparison methods for multi-criteria decision-making require significant cognitive effort, risk of inconsistency, and computational complexity, which limit their practical applications.

Method: The proposed TTM involves three phases: elicitation of judgments using fewer, carefully-selected comparisons, constructing a consistent pairwise matrix, and deriving a global value scale. It reduces comparisons to $m-1$ and ensures consistency by design.

Result: TTM minimizes decision-makers' cognitive burden, maintains consistency, and supports compatibility with the Deck of Cards method for handling interval and ratio scales. A web-based tool demonstrates its practical use cases.

Conclusion: The TTM presents a more efficient and consistent alternative for pairwise comparison in decision-making, solving traditional challenges and showing potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DODO, an AI algorithm that autonomously learns causal structures using interventions, outperforming baselines in reconstructing causal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI's understanding of underlying mechanisms via causality awareness, which leads to better AI performance beyond mere correlation detection.

Method: DODO is an algorithm where an Agent utilizes interventions and causal inference to infer hidden causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) governing an environment, even under noise.

Result: DODO demonstrates superior performance over observational methods. It can reconstruct causal graphs with minimal errors, achieving an improvement of +0.25 F1 points over baselines in the most challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Causality-aware AI, like DODO, can effectively and autonomously learn causal structures, paving the way for more robust and informed AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SR$^2$, a framework that addresses reasoning challenges in machine learning by focusing on latent space complexities and dependencies to improve performance on tasks like Sudoku and Maze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning tasks are challenging benchmarks for machine learning models, as even advanced models falter at these tasks that humans solve intuitively. The paper aims to re-examine reasoning through a causal, latent space perspective to offer actionable insights.

Method: The authors conceptualize reasoning as a selection mechanism, addressing latent-space complexities and structuring logical dependencies. They introduce SR$^2$, a framework with three modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment, leveraging latent variables as feedback.

Result: Their approach improves reasoning accuracy significantly, achieving over 10% higher performance with 8x fewer parameters on Sudoku and Maze tasks when compared to recent advances.

Conclusion: Understanding reasoning tasks through latent-space complexities and implementing SR$^2$ enhances both efficiency and accuracy. This highlights a promising direction for advancing machine learning models in logical reasoning domains.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a multi-step vulnerability attack on large language model-based agents, demonstrating high success rates while paradoxically enhancing the agents' task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concerns about the security and trustworthiness of large language model agents deployed in real-world applications.

Method: The researchers designed CoTri, which involves planting a sequence of triggers in the environment to achieve multi-step agentic manipulation, validated through experiments testing attack success rates and false trigger rates.

Result: CoTri showed near-perfect attack success rates, near-zero false trigger rates, and unexpectedly improved agent performance on benign tasks, as well as enhanced robustness to environmental distractions.

Conclusion: CoTri exposes vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents, enabling stealthy multi-step control, raising safety risks, and paradoxically improving agent capabilities and robustness.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-agent systems, specifically in achieving interoperability, efficient interactions, and effective knowledge sharing.

Method: The authors propose Co-TAP, a three-tier framework comprising three core protocols: Human-Agent Interaction Protocol (HAI) for interaction, Unified Agent Protocol (UAP) for infrastructure and interoperability, and Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK) for cognitive processing and knowledge sharing.

Result: The proposed protocols aim to enable improved real-time interactions, seamless interconnectivity among heterogeneous agents, and the development of collective intelligence through experiential learning and shared knowledge.

Conclusion: Co-TAP offers an engineering and theoretical platform for next-generation multi-agent applications, emphasizing efficiency, scalability, and intelligence.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Motivation: To improve the efficiency of solving related optimization problems in machine learning by leveraging shared problem structure and scaling symmetries.

Method: The authors propose ScaleGMNs, which operate in weight space and exploit scaling symmetries. They show how these metanetworks enable direct fine-tuning of models, bypassing iterative optimization steps.

Result: Empirical tests show ScaleGMNs are effective. The paper also proves that gauge freedom due to scaling symmetries is smaller in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) than in multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), explaining why architectures perform differently.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware metanetworks, like ScaleGMNs, are powerful for efficient, generalizable optimization across neural network architectures. Open-source code is provided for further exploration.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

### [58] [First Try Matters: Revisiting the Role of Reflection in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08308)
*Liwei Kang,Yue Deng,Yao Xiao,Zhanfeng Mo,Wee Sun Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reasoning models' effectiveness of reflective behaviors, finding that reflections rarely change initial answers. It proposes methods to reduce unnecessary steps, improving token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of reflections in large language model reasoning and optimize their efficiency.

Method: Analysis of eight models on five datasets, plus training models with varying reflection steps to observe performance differences. Introduced early-stopping and truncation methods.

Result: Reflections mainly confirm answers; fine-tuning improves first-answer accuracy but doesn't enhance correction ability. Proposed methods reduce token usage with minimal accuracy impact.

Conclusion: Effective reasoning doesn't require excessive reflections, and optimizing the process enhances efficiency without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of Pass@k in evaluating reasoning tasks of RLVR models and introduces Cover@τ as a more robust alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observed limitations of the Pass@k metric in reflecting a model's reasoning capabilities, particularly in discrete answer space tasks like math.

Method: The authors propose a new metric, Cover@τ, which evaluates the fraction of problems a model solves where at least a proportion τ of completions are accurate, emphasizing reliability over random guessing.

Result: The new metric, Cover@τ, highlights changes in the ranking of RLVR models and presents a more nuanced view of their reasoning boundaries.

Conclusion: Cover@τ provides a more reliable and interpretable assessment of reasoning abilities, challenging prior conclusions based on Pass@k and offering insights into model evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

*Benjamin F. Maier,Ulf Aslak,Luca Fiaschi,Nina Rismal,Kemble Fletcher,Christian C. Luhmann,Robbie Dow,Kli Pappas,Thomas V. Wiecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in consumer research by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate consumer responses using semantic similarity rating (SSR), achieving high reliability and realistic distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consumer research is costly, suffers from panel biases, and lacks scalability, driving the need for an alternative methodology.

Method: The proposed SSR method collects textual responses from LLMs and converts these into Likert-scale ratings by calculating embedding similarities with reference statements. The approach was tested on data from 57 personal care product surveys.

Result: SSR achieved 90% of the test-retest reliability of human responses and maintained realistic response distributions with a KS similarity of over 0.85. It also provided detailed qualitative insights.

Conclusion: The SSR framework allows scalable and interpretable consumer research using synthetic respondents, preserving survey metrics while offering the added value of qualitative feedback.

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

*Yi Jiang,Lei Shen,Lujie Niu,Sendong Zhao,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces QAgent, a search agent framework to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by improving query understanding through reinforcement learning (RL), enabling better generalization and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by their static knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive tasks. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and RL-trained search agents face challenges in query understanding, generalization, and deployment.

Method: The proposed QAgent employs a modular, multi-step decision-making search agent trained with reinforcement learning to improve query understanding and retrieval quality.

Result: QAgent demonstrates high performance in question answering tasks and serves as a plug-and-play module for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The framework enhances RAG by focusing on adaptive retrieval and query understanding, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches and improving LLM performance in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by quantifying uncertainty using the effective rank of hidden states, improving interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting hallucinations in LLMs, which is critical for their trustworthy deployment.

Method: The method involves using the effective rank of hidden states derived from model outputs and different layers, grounded in spectral analysis, to quantify uncertainty without requiring extra knowledge or modules.

Result: The proposed method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The approach introduces a new paradigm for hallucination detection in LLMs, combining theoretical justification with practical application to enhance LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

*Bianca-Mihaela Ganescu,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight vision-language model architecture leveraging dynamic gating, feature modulation, and auxiliary objectives to achieve efficient and interpretable multimodal learning within constraints of the BabyLM Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently integrating multimodal (visual and linguistic) information with limited training data, motivated by cognitive plausibility and constraints of the BabyLM Challenge.

Method: The proposed model employs a lightweight decoder-based architecture with token-wise dynamic gating, feature modulation, channel attention for visual cues, and auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding.

Result: Evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to multimodal baselines, while the dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns in multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: Dynamic gating is established as a robust method for efficient and interpretable multimodal learning under constrained scenarios, despite noted limitations like global image embeddings and unstable dataset splits.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

*Shangheng Du,Xiangchao Yan,Dengyang Jiang,Jiakang Yuan,Yusong Hu,Xin Li,Liang He,Bo Zhang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMLGen, a system combining an LLM agent with domain-specific knowledge and Monte Carlo Graph Search to improve performance in Machine Learning Engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in complex Machine Learning Engineering tasks because they rely heavily on expert adjustments and lack domain-specific fine-grained priors.

Method: The authors propose AutoMLGen, which integrates a domain knowledge base with Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration and dynamic path optimization.

Result: AutoMLGen demonstrated superior outcomes on MLE-Bench tests, achieving high performance metrics like medal rates and valid submission rates, all within reduced runtime limits.

Conclusion: AutoMLGen efficiently enhances self-evolving ability, optimizes search space diversity, and accelerates convergence to improve performance in Machine Learning Engineering settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

*Grace Liu,Yuxiao Qu,Jeff Schneider,Aarti Singh,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaRT, a fine-tuning approach for teaching LLMs strategic stopping during information gathering, enhancing decision-making in tasks like diagnosis and math problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to decide when to strategically stop information gathering to avoid overthinking or task derailment.

Method: The CaRT method fine-tunes LLMs with counterfactual trajectory pairs where one reflects appropriate stopping and the other doesn't, training the model to verbalize reasoning for its decisions.

Result: CaRT improved both information-gathering efficiency and task success in interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving domains compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CaRT demonstrates effective teaching of termination decisions to LLMs, making them more efficient and successful in strategic decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Motivation: Address the challenges associated with deep research tasks: broad knowledge spaces and multi-step reasoning dependencies for agentic systems.

Method: Introduced FlowSearch, emphasizing dynamic knowledge flow construction, parallel exploration, hierarchical task decomposition, and real-time feedback adjustment.

Result: FlowSearch achieved state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks (GAIA, HLE, GPQA, TRQA), validating its effectiveness in research and scientific discovery applications.

Conclusion: FlowSearch shows significant promise in advancing scientific discovery and improving performance in multi-disciplinary and complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured

of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method called "early experience" to address challenges in training language agents by using data generated by the agent's own actions rather than relying on expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents with reinforcement learning is difficult due to lack of verifiable rewards and inefficient rollouts, and supervised fine-tuning on expert data generalizes poorly.

Method: Introduces the concept of "early experience," leveraging implicit world modeling and self-reflection to guide agents using data from their own actions.

Result: The proposed approach improves agent effectiveness and generalization in diverse environments, and shows potential as a precursor to reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Early experience serves as a promising middle ground between imitation learning and fully autonomous, experience-driven agent training.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: The paper addresses sequential fine-tuning for large multimodal models (LMMs) to add new skills without erasing previous abilities. It proposes efficient tuning strategies that balance skill acquisition with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of sequential fine-tuning where large multimodal models forget prior capabilities while learning new skills.

Method: The paper introduces two tuning methods: (1) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (2) updating only specific components (MLP Gate&Up) while freezing others.

Result: The proposed methods achieve strong performance on new tasks while minimizing performance degradation on held-out benchmarks across multiple model families.

Conclusion: Strategic fine-tuning enables learning new skills without significant forgetting of prior abilities, offering a robust pathway for sequential fine-tuning in LMMs.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and missed opportunities for modern servers to enter deep idle states due to poor idle-governor accuracy and high latency.

Method: Three queuing models (M/M/1, cxM/M/1, M/M/c) are employed to estimate theoretical idle time distributions at the CPU core and system levels. Real server data is compared against these theoretical models.

Result: Significant discrepancies are found between modeled idle opportunities and actual idle times of real servers, highlighting inefficiencies in idle management.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables early-stage design exploration and provides insights for optimizing server configurations and load to better exploit idle time.

Abstract: This work introduces a model-based framework that reveals the idle
opportunity of modern servers running latency-critical applications.
Specifically, three queuing models, M/M/1, cxM/M/1, and M/M/c, are used to
estimate the theoretical idle time distribution at the CPU core and system
(package) level. A comparison of the actual idleness of a real server and that
from the theoretical models reveals significant missed opportunities to enter
deep idle states. This inefficiency is attributed to the idle-governor
inaccuracy and the high latency to transition to/from legacy deep-idle states.
The proposed methodology offers the means for an early-stage design exploration
and insights into idle time behavior and opportunities for varying server

*Parker Hao Tian,Zahra Yousefijamarani,Alaa Alameldeen*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DL-PIM, an architecture designed to enhance data locality in PIM systems, leading to reduced data movement overhead and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PIM architectures face challenges with performance and energy efficiency due to data transfer overheads stemming from remote memory accesses.

Method: The authors propose DL-PIM, which uses a distributed address-indirection hardware lookup table to track and dynamically relocate data to local memory, improving data locality. The design also includes an adaptive mechanism that activates or deactivates indirection based on cost-benefit analysis.

Result: DL-PIM reduces average memory latency per request by 54% in HMC and 50% in HBM, leading to performance improvements of 15% in HMC and 5% in HBM for workloads with substantial data reuse. Overall, it achieves a 6% speedup in HMC and a 3% speedup in HBM across all tested workloads.

Conclusion: DL-PIM successfully enhances data locality, reduces memory latency, and improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for PIM systems focusing on data-intensive workloads.

Abstract: PIM architectures aim to reduce data transfer costs between processors and
memory by integrating processing units within memory layers. Prior PIM
architectures have shown potential to improve energy efficiency and
performance. However, such advantages rely on data proximity to the processing
units performing computations. Data movement overheads can degrade PIM's
performance and energy efficiency due to the need to move data between a
processing unit and a distant memory location. %they face challenges due to the
overhead of transferring data from remote memory locations to processing units
inside memory for computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that a large
fraction of PIM's latency per memory request is attributed to data transfers
and queuing delays from remote memory accesses. To improve PIM's data locality,
we propose DL-PIM, a novel architecture that dynamically detects the overhead
of data movement, and proactively moves data to a reserved area in the local
memory of the requesting processing unit. DL-PIM uses a distributed
address-indirection hardware lookup table to redirect traffic to the current
data location. We propose DL-PIM implementations on two 3D stacked memories:
HMC and HBM. While some workloads benefit from DL-PIM, others are negatively
impacted by the additional latency due to indirection accesses. Therefore, we
propose an adaptive mechanism that assesses the cost and benefit of indirection
and dynamically enables or disables it to prevent degrading workloads that
suffer from indirection. Overall, DL-PIM reduces the average memory latency per
request by 54% in HMC and 50% in HBM which resulted in performance improvement
of 15% for workloads with substantial data reuse in HMC and 5% in HBM. For all
representative workloads, DL-PIM achieved a 6% speedup in HMC and a 3% speedup
in HBM, showing that DL-PIM enhances data locality and overall system
performance.

Conclusion: FMCache is effective in improving throughput, reducing server loads, and maintaining low latency with modest resource usage, highlighting its practical value.

Abstract: Fast and scalable metadata management across multiple metadata servers is
crucial for distributed file systems to handle numerous files and directories.
Client-side caching of frequently accessed metadata can mitigate server loads,
but incurs significant overhead and complexity in maintaining cache consistency
when the number of clients increases. We propose FMCache, an in-switch
file-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to
serve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the
switch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, FMCache
addresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch
resource constraints. We implement FMCache atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on
a Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads.
FMCache achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and
complements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to
139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage.

### [73] [SPAD: Specialized Prefill and Decode Hardware for Disaggregated LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08544)
*Hengrui Zhang,Pratyush Patel,August Ning,David Wentzlaff*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPAD, a specialized hardware system to optimize cost and efficiency for distinct phases of LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GPUs and TPUs lead to inefficiencies and underutilization in LLM inference due to their generalized design.

Method: Develop specialized chips, Prefill Chips and Decode Chips, for each LLM inference phase using tailored hardware configurations.

Result: Simulations indicate significant cost reduction (19-41%), higher efficiency, and adaptability of SPAD compared to current baseline clusters.

Conclusion: SPAD provides a cost-effective and efficient hardware solution for LLM inference with enduring adaptability for evolving workloads and models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years, driving
up the demand for inference. LLM inference is composed of two phases with
distinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a
memory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes
prefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,
existing hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.
Current datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that
maximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth
underutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the
decode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving
costs.
  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting
a less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct
characteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have
larger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed
Decode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared
to modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%
higher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the
proposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.
  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware
cost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while
offering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can
reallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43%
lower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design.

### [74] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores sentiment inconsistency in urban environments using social media data and street view images, focusing on Beijing Second Ring from 2016 to 2022.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge and improve sentiment analysis methods in urban studies by addressing the mismatch between human perception and opinion in urban environments.

Method: The study utilized 140,750 Baidu and Tencent Street view images and 984,024 Weibo posts, employing object detection and NLP techniques to categorize sentiments, alongside regression analysis and visualization tools.

Result: The sentiment analysis revealed evenly distributed positive perceptions, extreme changes in opinions, and significant sentiment disparities linked to urban features like dense buildings and pedestrian activity.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights on urban sentiment changes pre- and post-pandemic, highlighting implications for environmental management and urban renewal strategies.

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HaystackCraft, a benchmark designed to test robustness of large language models (LLMs) in handling noisy long contexts influenced by real-world retrieval and agentic challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate LLMs on synthetic 'needle-in-a-haystack' tasks, which fail to realistically represent noise from biased retrieval and cascading errors in dynamic workflows.

Method: HaystackCraft simulates noise using the Wikipedia hyperlink network for multi-hop questions, heterogeneous retrieval strategies (dense, sparse, hybrid, graph-based), and dynamic settings reflecting agentic operations.

Result: Across experiments with 15 LLMs, dense retrieval yielded challenging distractors, graph-based methods improved retrieval results, and agentic tests exposed cascading errors in models' reasoning processes.

Conclusion: HaystackCraft reveals persistent limitations in LLMs' handling of noisy and dynamic contexts, offering a crucial tool for advancing robustness in long-context reasoning.

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [76] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for contextual lemmatization compared to traditional supervised approaches, finding that LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results across 12 languages with in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore whether LLMs can excel in contextual lemmatization tasks, particularly when supervised training data for specific domains or languages is unavailable.

Method: The method compared encoder-only supervised approaches and cross-lingual models against direct in-context lemma generation using LLMs across 12 languages with varying morphological complexity.

Result: The experimental results showed that LLMs outperform most traditional methods in lemmatizing across diverse languages without prior fine-tuning, using only a few context examples.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate a superior capacity for in-context lemmatization, achieving state-of-the-art results, thus offering a promising alternative when domain-specific training data is lacking.

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LASER, an LLM-based ASR evaluation method, which improves scoring accuracy by focusing on semantics instead of strict lexical comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional ASR evaluation metrics like WER, which unfairly penalize minor linguistic nuances despite semantic correctness.

Method: The LASER framework uses state-of-the-art LLMs with in-context learning to evaluate ASR quality. Hindi examples were provided in prompts, and smaller models like Llama 3 were fine-tuned for penalty prediction.

Result: LASER achieved a 94% correlation with human annotations for Hindi examples and remained effective for other Indian languages. Llama 3 achieved an 89% accuracy in penalty prediction tasks.

Conclusion: LASER provides a more nuanced evaluation metric that aligns better with human judgment and generalizes effectively across multiple languages.

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop meaningful evaluation metrics for sign language systems to aid reproducibility and practicality.

Method: Conducted meta-evaluation and human correlation studies across sign languages using keypoint, embedding, and back-translation metrics.

Conclusion: The study offers a practical framework and tools for assessing sign language translation and generation technologies.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of

### [79] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a domain-specific prompting strategy using rubric-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs) to classify populist content in speeches as accurately as expert human coders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to measure the ideational content of populism efficiently and accurately across languages and large datasets, overcoming the limitations of costly and slow traditional textual analysis approaches.

Method: The authors developed a prompting approach using rubric and anchor-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning guided by the documentation used to train human coders. LLMs were tested using the Global Populism Database to replicate populism classification scores.

Result: The proposed prompting strategy enabled LLMs to achieve classification accuracy comparable to human experts, even in the nuanced and context-sensitive content of populist speeches.

Conclusion: Rubric-based CoT prompting effectively trains LLMs for domain-specific tasks like populism content classification, offering scalable and accurate alternatives to traditional human coding.

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAPRO, a framework for systematically optimizing prompts in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) face challenges due to prompt sensitivity, instability, and lack of systematic design methods for prompt optimization.

Method: MAPRO employs a four-stage framework, formulating MAS prompt optimization as a MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) inference problem and solving it via language-guided max-product belief propagation, with topology-aware refinement to iteratively update prompts.

Result: MAPRO demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, outperforming both manually designed solutions and recent automated methods.

Conclusion: MAPRO offers a principled, effective approach for MAS prompt optimization and provides general guidelines for building reliable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [81] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsyncSpade, an approach to achieve efficient test-time scaling (TTS) for LLMs by avoiding memory bottlenecks and sequential dependencies, achieving significant speed and performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs) enhances performance but faces challenges of memory inefficiency and high runtime due to linear KV-cache growth and sequential-dependent query-aware page-level decoding.

Method: AsyncSpade employs a temporal-regressive module to predict next-token query states without sequential dependence and introduces an asynchronous framework to decouple KV-cache filtering from the decoding loop, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity.

Result: AsyncSpade achieves a theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT), showing over 20% TPOT reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline (Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3 models, while maintaining or improving accuracy on multiple TTS benchmarks.

Conclusion: AsyncSpade effectively addresses LLM memory bottlenecks and decoding inefficiencies during TTS, offering substantial speedups and maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MAS with LLM agents perform under team dynamics inspired by human team science, including factors like structure, diversity, and interaction.

Method: They use a multi-agent framework to evaluate performance on tasks involving commonsense and social reasoning across different team structures and diversity levels.

Result: Results indicate flat teams outperform hierarchical ones, diversity has mixed effects, agents are overconfident about performance but value collaboration despite integration hurdles.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and challenges of LLM-powered MAS, underscoring the importance of team structure and dynamics for performance optimization.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates enhancing reasoning in multi-stream speech large language models (LLMs) using techniques like CoT fine-tuning, introducing an entropy-based metric for latency control, and preference optimization to balance accuracy and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech LLMs underperform in complex reasoning tasks despite recent advancements, necessitating approaches to improve both reasoning and response latency in voice-based models.

Method: The authors propose CoT fine-tuning for reasoning, an entropy-based "question completeness" metric for controlling latency by initiating reasoning earlier, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine the accuracy-latency balance using preference data.

Result: The methods improved speech LLM reasoning accuracy by 2.4x on average, reduced latency by 70% with no accuracy loss, and yielded a 4% accuracy gain in ARC-Easy compared to heuristic methods under similar latency conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly enhance the accuracy and latency of speech LLMs, demonstrating a strong accuracy-latency trade-off and advancing spoken reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [84] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL), a framework enhancing Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) by structuring reasoning with reusable thought templates for multi-hop inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-Context Language Models struggle to connect evidence effectively during multi-hop reasoning across large sets of retrieved documents.

Method: The authors propose 'thought templates' derived from problem-solving traces, updated iteratively via natural-language feedback, to structure evidence and guide multi-hop inference.

Result: Their approach significantly outperforms baselines in retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings across diverse benchmarks. Optimized templates were also distilled into smaller open-source models.

Conclusion: ToTAL improves reasoning efficiency and broadens applicability in LCLMs through the reuse of structured templates, making it versatile and effective across tasks.

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of transliteration between the Perso-Arabic script used in Iran and Afghanistan and the Tajik-Cyrillic script used in Tajikistan. It presents a state-of-the-art model along with new datasets for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of bridging the communication gap between Persian speakers in different regions caused by differing scripts, and the limitations of existing transliteration systems, which lack versatility due to their reliance on limited and domain-specific datasets.

Method: To address this issue, the authors developed a sequence-to-sequence model trained across all available datasets and introduced two additional datasets to enhance domain diversity and benchmark clarity.

Result: The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance, with chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 for Farsi to Tajik transliteration and 92.28 and 0.04 for Tajik to Farsi transliteration.

Conclusion: The study not only provides a versatile transliteration model but also contributes valuable datasets that establish comprehensive benchmarks and enhance understanding of the task's complexity.

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available

*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies that existing speculative decoding methods for large language models struggle with long contexts, proposes a new benchmark (LongSpecBench), introduces a novel model (OWL), and achieves significant improvements in long-context settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods for large language models face severe limitations when handling long contexts, as demonstrated by their performance degradation in practical settings compared to benchmarks with short contexts.

Method: The proposed solution includes creating a new benchmark (LongSpecBench) and designing the OWL model with three key innovations: an LSTM-based drafter conditioned on the last-token state, a specialized [SPEC] token in the verifier, and a hybrid decoding algorithm (combining tree and non-tree methods).

Result: The OWL model demonstrates a 5x improvement in acceptance length on long-context inputs compared to EAGLE3 and resolves performance degradation issues.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for large language models in long-context scenarios, providing tools and insights for further research.

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

### [87] [Deploying Tiny LVLM Judges for Real-World Evaluation of Chart Models: Lessons Learned and Best Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07545)
*Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Mohammed Saidul Islam,Ridwan Mahbub,Mizanur Rahman,Amran Bhuiyan,Israt Jahan,Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Shafiq Joty,Enamul Hoque,Jimmy Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tiny LVLMs (2B parameters) underperform as judges in chart comprehension tasks, but two cost-effective methods are proposed to improve performance: multi-criteria prompting and domain-adaptive transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of tiny models in real-world, resource-constrained environments, especially in chart comprehension tasks.

Method: Multi-criteria prompting combines multiple evaluation criteria into one query, while domain-adaptive transfer learning fine-tunes models with synthetic judgments in a specialized dataset.

Result: Multi-criteria prompting highlighted robustness issues in 7B models, while ChartJudge (a fine-tuned 2B model) successfully transferred knowledge across datasets, demonstrating its specialization.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into balancing model size, prompt design, and transferability for scalable, cost-effective chart reasoning evaluations, enhancing the utility of smaller models.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

*Junyi Zhu,Savas Ozkan,Andrea Maracani,Sinan Mutlu,Cho Jung Min,Mete Ozay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-task pre-finetuning framework with task-primary LoRA modules to improve NLP model adaptability on mobile platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop NLP models that are adaptable across various applications while remaining efficient in terms of memory and computation, addressing challenges in practical deployment on mobile platforms.

Method: A multi-task pre-finetuning framework was devised, employing a shared encoder backbone with task-primary LoRA modules for modularity and resolving optimization signal conflicts.

Result: The method showed performance improvements of +0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification across 21 downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness for mobile NLP.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables adaptable and efficient models suitable for deployment in versatile NLP applications on mobile devices, balancing performance and practical constraints.

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

### [89] [Linguistic Patterns in Pandemic-Related Content: A Comparative Analysis of COVID-19, Constraint, and Monkeypox Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07579)
*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes linguistic differences between pandemic-related health misinformation and factual communication, identifying features like lower readability and increased emotional language in misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand how linguistic patterns differentiate between health misinformation and factual communication in pandemic-related online discourse.

Method: The study uses three corpora of COVID-19 and Monkeypox-related posts, analyzing readability, rhetorical markers, and persuasive language.

Result: COVID-19 misinformation had lower readability and more fear-related persuasive terms, along with distinct rhetorical and stylistic differences from factual content and Monkeypox-related posts.

Conclusion: Linguistic indicators, such as readability and emotional cues, can aid in detecting misinformation and improving public health communication. Limitations include narrow lexicons and static analysis, calling for future studies with broader and dynamic methodologies.

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

### [90] [IASC: Interactive Agentic System for ConLangs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07591)
*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create artificial Constructed Languages. The system handles phonology, morphosyntax, lexicon creation, orthography design, and grammar handbook writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to make creating constructed languages enjoyable while investigating the linguistic understanding and capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The method involves modular language creation steps using feedback-based refinement, morphosyntactic translation, phonology-guided lexicons, orthography selection, and system-generated grammatical descriptions.

Result: The system successfully constructs languages and highlights significant variations in LLMs' ability to handle common versus rare linguistic patterns. It also discusses the challenges of translating high-resource languages to low-resource ones.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the fun and intellectual insights of using LLMs for conlang creation and suggests potential improvements for overcoming challenges in language translation tasks between resource-rich and resource-poor languages.

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

### [91] [Vocabulary embeddings organize linguistic structure early in language model training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07613)
*Isabel Papadimitriou,Jacob Prince*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how input embedding geometry in large language models (LLMs) like Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B evolves during training, focusing on semantic, syntactic, and frequency-based features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how the representations of input vocabularies in large language models are structured and evolve during training, given the role these representations play in language modeling capabilities.

Method: The authors use representational similarity analysis to evaluate the alignment of input and output embedding geometries with semantic, syntactic, and frequency-based metrics over training phases.

Result: They find that embedding geometry quickly aligns with linguistic features, and high-frequency/function words establish final representations faster than less frequent words. Low-frequency words show some persistency from random initialization biases.

Conclusion: The paper highlights how the evolution of vocabulary embedding geometry contributes to linguistic structure acquisition in LLMs, underscoring the roles of word frequency and function in organizing these geometries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

### [92] [Toward Reliable Clinical Coding with Language Models: Verification and Lightweight Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07629)
*Zhangdie Yuan,Han-Chin Shing,Mitch Strong,Chaitanya Shivade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve clinical coding accuracy using LLMs by addressing hierarchical code misalignments, employing lightweight techniques like prompt engineering, and creating a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address shortcomings in current LLMs for clinical coding tasks, especially their inability to handle hierarchical misalignments and limitations in existing datasets.

Method: The study introduces lightweight interventions like prompt engineering and fine-tuning to enhance LLM performance. It also proposes a clinical code verification step and provides a new annotated benchmark dataset.

Result: The results demonstrate that these approaches improve accuracy in hierarchical cases and show that verification is an effective strategy for medical coding.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that addressing hierarchical errors and utilizing verification significantly enhance LLM-based clinical coding, making it a more reliable tool for healthcare applications.

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

*Đorđe Klisura,Joseph Khoury,Ashish Kundu,Ram Krishnan,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing access control in large language models (LLMs) to ensure role-conditioned refusals, evaluating various methods against PostgreSQL-based role policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of securing access control in LLMs, which struggle with role distinctions and adherence to predefined policies.

Method: The researchers extended existing text-to-SQL datasets (Spider and BIRD), applied role-based PostgreSQL policies, and tested three designs: prompting, a generator-verifier pipeline, and fine-tuning with LoRA.

Result: Explicit verification (two-step method) improves refusal precision but fine-tuning strikes a better balance between safety and execution accuracy. However, complex policies pose challenges.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning models for permission awareness offer a promising path for securing LLMs while dataset and tool releases aim to advance further research.

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ryt AI, a regulator-approved LLM-native framework enabling conversational banking through secure and efficient natural-language interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to create a conversational AI interface for banking, replacing traditional multi-screen workflows while adhering to regulatory and security requirements.

Method: The method involves developing Ryt AI with ILMU, an internal LLM, augmented by LoRA adapters for specialized tasks, deterministic guardrails, and a stateless audit architecture to ensure security and compliance.

Result: The study achieves a conversational AI interface for banking, powered by LLM agents, which meets regulatory approval and successfully handles core financial operations securely and efficiently.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the feasibility of deploying regulator-approved conversational AI as a primary interface for banking, proving its reliability and compliance in handling financial operations.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

### [95] [OBCache: Optimal Brain KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07651)
*Yuzhe Gu,Xiyu Liang,Jiaojiao Zhao,Enmao Diao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a structured pruning framework that optimizes memory usage in large language models (LLMs) by enhancing the caching mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory overhead in LLMs with extended context windows, due to caching key-value states, poses scalability challenges for long sequences and large batch sizes.

Method: The paper applies Optimal Brain Damage theory to compute token saliency based on perturbations in attention outputs, providing output-aware eviction scores for keys, values, and key-value pairs.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models show improved long-context accuracy when using OBCache's output-aware token saliency scores compared to heuristic methods.

Conclusion: OBCache enhances existing caching strategies by introducing principled, output-aware scores, addressing memory challenges in long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

*Virginia K. Felkner,Allison Lim,Jonathan May*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates natural language inference (NLI) as a bias measurement method for language models, comparing it to traditional token probability (TP) metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias measurement methods in language models, such as token probability (TP), are criticized for their lack of alignment with real-world use cases and harms.

Method: The study compares NLI metrics to TP metrics in their ability to measure bias in language models, analyzing correlation and sensitivity to counterstereotypical sentences.

Result: NLI metrics detect underdebiased cases better but show high sensitivity to wording and lower robustness compared to TP approaches.

Conclusion: Neither NLI nor TP is consistently superior as a bias metric. Using a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream evaluations for comprehensive bias measurement is recommended.

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

*Daiki Chijiwa,Taku Hasegawa,Kyosuke Nishida,Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Tomoya Ohba,Tamao Sakao,Susumu Takeuchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for lossless vocabulary reduction in auto-regressive language models to enable cooperation among models with different tokenizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models with distinct vocabularies struggle to collaborate due to differences in tokenization, limiting efficiency in tasks like model ensemble.

Method: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to reduce a language model's vocabulary size without compromising accuracy, enabling seamless cooperation among models.

Result: Models with different tokenizations can efficiently collaborate through a shared maximal common vocabulary, preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: Lossless vocabulary reduction allows language models to interact effectively despite having different tokenizations, improving cooperative capabilities.

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a methodology to stress-test large language models (LLMs) by identifying contradictions and ambiguities in their behavioral specifications, examining over 70,000 cases across models from providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in AI constitutions and model specifications, such as internal conflicts and the lack of nuanced scenario coverage.

Method: The authors generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios, where LLMs must navigate conflicts between valid principles, and analyze responses from twelve leading LLMs to measure behavioral divergence.

Result: The study finds over 70,000 cases of significant behavioral divergence and demonstrates that these divergences strongly correlate with problems in model specifications. It also identifies misalignments, false positives, and value prioritization patterns among models.

Conclusion: The research highlights critical issues in the ethical and behavioral guidelines of leading LLMs, offering a methodology for systematic evaluation and improvement of model specifications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can revolutionize cellular biology by enabling computational systems that simulate cellular behavior and states.

Method: The paper presents a taxonomy categorizing methods into LLMs as Oracles (direct modeling) and LLMs as Agents (task orchestration). It reviews tasks, models, datasets, and evaluation benchmarks.

Result: Identifies three main tasks—cellular representation, perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference—and assesses their current progress and challenges.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in virtual cell modeling, there are critical issues in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability that need addressing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

*Chengshuai Zhao,Shu Wan,Paras Sheth,Karan Patwa,K. Selçuk Candan,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CADET, a framework that uses causal representation learning to improve hate speech detection by disentangling it into interpretable factors and isolating genuine intent from linguistic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate speech detection models struggle with detecting implicit hate conveyed through sarcasm, irony, or coded language. Additionally, spurious correlations induced by platform-specific variations in hate speech styles and target groups make detection even more challenging.

Method: The authors propose a causal graph that models hate speech generation by considering key factors like context, creator motivation, target, and style. Using this graph, CADET learns latent representations, isolates genuine hate intent, controls confounders, and performs counterfactual reasoning to robustly identify varying forms of hate speech.

Result: CADET exhibits superior performance across comprehensive experiments, demonstrating its ability to generalize hate speech detection across diverse styles and platforms.

Conclusion: The integration of causal priors within CADET shows promise in advancing the robustness and generalizability of hate speech detection models.

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

### [101] [MemWeaver: A Hierarchical Memory from Textual Interactive Behaviors for Personalized Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07713)
*Shuo Yu,Mingyue Cheng,Daoyu Wang,Qi Liu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemWeaver introduces a personalized generation framework leveraging hierarchical memory from user textual history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve personalization by addressing limitations in current approaches that use user history as flat text lists, ignoring temporal and semantic dimensions.

Method: MemWeaver builds a dual-component memory: behavioral memory for user actions and cognitive memory for long-term preferences. These integrate temporal and semantic aspects.

Result: MemWeaver's performance is validated using the LaMP benchmark, showing effective reasoning in personalized generation.

Conclusion: Hierarchical memory enables deeper personalization by integrating different levels of user information, offering improvements in user engagement.

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is

*Jiaoyang Li,Junhao Ruan,Shengwei Tang,Saihan Chen,Kaiyan Chang,Yuan Ge,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubQRAG is a framework for multi-hop question answering (QA) that improves reasoning by decomposing queries into sub-questions and employing a dynamically expandable graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG), which lacks structured reasoning depth for complex multi-hop question answering tasks.

Method: SubQRAG decomposes questions into verifiable sub-questions, retrieves relevant knowledge graph triples per sub-question, dynamically expands the graph from source documents when needed, and aggregates all reasoning triples into a "graph memory."

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show significant improvements in multi-hop QA performance, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG enhances reasoning depth and traceability in multi-hop QA by creating structured evidence paths, demonstrating clear advancements over existing methods.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

*Cunli Mao,Xiaofei Gao,Ran Song,Shizhu He,Shengxiang Gao,Kang Liu,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework for Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC), improving over state-of-the-art methods by introducing KL-GMoE and IER for enhanced knowledge sharing and utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MKGC research underutilizes the multilingual capabilities of large language models and ignores cross-lingual knowledge shareability.

Method: The proposed framework consists of two components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) to model shared knowledge efficiently, and Iterative Entity Reranking (IER) to enhance its utilization.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art MKGC methods, achieving 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% improvements in Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages shared multilingual knowledge, demonstrating its potential in addressing unseen and unbalanced language settings in MKGC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

*Fu Chen,Peng Wang,Xiyin Li,Wen Li,Shichi Lei,Dongdong Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ToolExpander, a novel framework improving small-scale LLM performance in GRPO-based tool-oriented reinforcement learning, overcoming training stability issues and enhancing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small-scale LLMs using GRPO struggle with poor response accuracy and mid-training collapse, limiting performance and stability.

Method: ToolExpander introduces (1) Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling to replace challenging samples with high-quality demonstrations and uses exponential learning rate decay for stability, and (2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking to improve GRPO by removing KL divergence, using adjusted clipping coefficients, and minimal reward incentives for generating examples.

Result: Experimental results indicate significant improvement in tool-using capabilities, stability, and performance of small-scale LLMs trained using ToolExpander.

Conclusion: ToolExpander effectively addresses GRPO limitations in small-scale LLMs by enhancing performance and training stability, showcasing its potential in resource-constrained reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

*Tianci Liu,Ran Xu,Tony Yu,Ilgee Hong,Carl Yang,Tuo Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenRubrics, a dataset and methodology for better reward modeling using rubric generation in reinforcement learning. It achieves superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models in reinforcement learning fail to capture the nuanced nature of human preferences and rely heavily on scalar or pairwise judgments, which are insufficient.

Method: The authors propose a dataset called OpenRubrics and present Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), a novel approach that distinguishes between preferred and rejected responses using both hard rules and implicit principles. They also use rejection sampling to improve preference-label consistency.

Result: Rubric-based reward models trained with OpenRubrics outperform strong baselines by 6.8% and generalize well to various policy models across instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks.

Conclusion: OpenRubrics and rubric-based methods offer scalable alignment signals and represent a principle-driven paradigm that could bridge the gap between costly human evaluation and automated reward modeling, enhancing LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

*Runyang You,Yongqi Li,Meng Liu,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores parallel test-time scaling (TTS) for latent reasoning models in large language models by introducing stochastic sampling strategies and a scoring mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of explicit reasoning methods and enable parallel test-time scaling in latent reasoning models, which lack sampling mechanisms and aggregation methods.

Method: Two stochastic sampling strategies (Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise) for latent reasoning, coupled with a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained to guide trajectory aggregation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate scalability and distinct exploration dynamics for sampling strategies, and the LatentRM effectively scores and selects trajectories.

Conclusion: Parallel TTS for latent reasoning models is feasible, opening a pathway for scalable inference in continuous spaces.

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

*Nishant Balepur,Atrey Desai,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with choices-only input indicates shallow reasoning or valid reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns that LLMs succeed in MCQA using choices-only inputs without genuine understanding, raising questions about the validity and depth of their reasoning strategies.

Method: Experiments comparing LLM performance on full inputs (including questions and reasoning) versus choices-only inputs, analyzing factors like trace length and faithfulness tests.

Result: Reasoning boosts LLM accuracy in various settings, and analysis shows that choices-only success can rely on valid reasoning like deducing missing questions rather than shallow shortcuts.

Conclusion: Partial-input success in LLMs is not always problematic. Reasoning traces can help evaluate whether success is due to shallow strategies or valid reasoning, guiding better understanding and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for organizing unstructured tool collections into structured libraries, improving retrieval accuracy and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-augmented reasoning with large language models is hindered by the lack of domain-specific tools and scalability issues in generating and retrieving these tools.

Method: The authors introduce a process for refactoring unstructured tool collections by clustering them into semantically coherent topics and using a multi-agent framework to consolidate scattered functionalities into smaller, aggregated tools.

Result: Experimental results indicate improved tool retrieval accuracy, reasoning performance, and scalability compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed structured refactoring system enables the creation of smaller, powerful tool libraries that maintain functionality and improve reasoning tasks, demonstrating practicality for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies flaws in outcome-based reward systems for mathematical reasoning in large language models, introduces a Rubric Reward Model to evaluate reasoning steps, and shows improved accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of reward hacking in large language models' mathematical reasoning systems, exposing the unreliability of outcome-based rewards and their susceptibility to flawed reasoning processes.

Method: The researchers developed the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward system that evaluates step-by-step reasoning using problem-specific rubrics, and applied this in reinforcement learning on math benchmarks.

Result: RRM training significantly improved model performance, achieving increases in verified Pass@1024 accuracy and reducing flawed reasoning modes like Miracle Steps by 71%.

Conclusion: Rewarding reasoning processes rather than just outcomes is critical for improving the accuracy and reliability of mathematical reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

*Omar Mahmoud,Ali Khalil,Buddhika Laknath Semage,Thommen George Karimpanal,Santu Rana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how enhancing factual accuracy in large language models can weaken refusal behavior, leading to safety concerns. It introduces a method using sparse autoencoders to separate refusal and hallucination features, maintaining safety alignment during model improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked trade-off between improving truthfulness and preserving safety alignment in large language models, as enhancing factual accuracy may inadvertently weaken refusal behavior.

Method: The method involves using sparse autoencoders to disentangle refusal-related features from hallucination features, and applying subspace orthogonalization during fine-tuning to preserve refusal behavior while reducing hallucinations.

Result: Their method was evaluated on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing safety alignment with task utility and mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the tension between increasing truthfulness and maintaining safety alignment in large language models, ensuring refusal behavior is preserved while improving factual accuracy.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end multi-label joint learning method for few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) in dialogue systems, addressing error propagation in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively detect multiple intents in low-resource dialogue domains and eliminate error propagation found in two-stage traditional methods for few-shot MID.

Method: The proposed method constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge propagation, leveraging interaction relations between instances to improve multi-label prediction.

Result: The approach achieves an average improvement of 9.54% in AUC and 11.19% in Macro-F1 metrics in 1-shot scenarios compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a novel and effective few-shot MID method with superior performance, showcasing the importance of instance and label knowledge propagation over traditional pipelines.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores context drift in multi-turn interactions with LLMs, formalizing it as a stochastic process and showing it's a controllable equilibrium phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of context drift in multi-turn interactions, where a model's output diverges from goal-consistent behavior over time, creating issues in real-world deployments.

Method: The authors propose a dynamical framework to interpret context drift, using turn-wise KL divergence to quantify it and introducing a recurrence model to analyze its behavior as a bounded stochastic process. Experiments were conducted on synthetic tasks and user-agent simulations.

Result: Experiments revealed that multi-turn drift stabilizes at a noise-limited equilibrium instead of degrading indefinitely. Reminder interventions were found effective in reducing drift, aligning with theoretical expectations.

Conclusion: Multi-turn drift is a manageable equilibrium phenomenon, not inevitable decay, opening avenues for its study and mitigation in extended LLM interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

*Shuichiro Haruta,Kazunori Matsumoto,Zhi Li,Yanan Wang,Mori Kurokawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel rotation-constrained compensation method is proposed to reduce errors in structured pruning of large language models, preserving geometry and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured pruning of large language models introduces significant errors due to the limited calibration data, and existing methods either overfit or disrupt pretrained weights.

Method: The pruned parameters are updated under a rotation constraint, preserving geometry like norms and inner products. A variance-aware importance score is introduced to prioritize retention of dimensions affecting the principal directions.

Result: The proposed method was applied to LLaMA-7B and demonstrated improved perplexity and task accuracy on benchmarks like WikiText-2 and language understanding tasks.

Conclusion: This method effectively compensates for errors by maintaining the model’s geometry and improving key metrics, outperforming existing pruning approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of large language models to innovate single-cell biology while emphasizing the need for robust interpretability and ethical standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,
generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress
remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agentic RAG is optimized via HiPRAG, a methodology enabling fine-grained RL control for search efficiency, achieving improved QA performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in Agentic RAG search behaviors (over-search and under-search) impacting reliability and efficiency.

Method: Introduce HiPRAG with hierarchical rewards based on necessity assessments during reasoning, enhancing search decision efficiency.

Result: HiPRAG improves average QA benchmark accuracies (65.4% for 3B models, 67.2% for 7B models) while drastically reducing over-search (2.3%) and under-search rates.

Conclusion: Fine-grained RL control methods like HiPRAG enhance reasoning efficiency, showing generalizability across models, sizes, and RL algorithms.

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

### [116] [Dynamic Generation of Multi-LLM Agents Communication Topologies with Graph Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07799)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Guancheng Wan,Sophia Yin,Mengting Li,Yuchen Wu,Xiao Liang,Xinfeng Li,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Ying Nian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD), a generative framework for dynamically optimizing communication topologies in multi-agent systems driven by large language models, balancing multiple objectives like performance, cost, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of static or hand-crafted communication topologies in multi-agent systems using LLMs, which fail to adapt to diverse task demands and create inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks.

Method: The proposed method is Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD), which employs conditional discrete graph diffusion models to iteratively generate task-adaptive communication topologies. It incorporates a lightweight proxy model to predict multi-objective rewards and optimize the topologies in real time.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GTD produces task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, outperforming traditional methods in benchmarks for LLM agent collaboration.

Conclusion: GTD effectively addresses the challenge of designing optimal communication topologies, offering a dynamic and adaptive solution that optimizes performance, cost, and other trade-offs in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

*Yuxin Huang,Simeng Wu,Ran Song,Yan Xiang,Yantuan Xian,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGR-CSC to improve multilingual generative retrieval by aligning semantics and reducing redundancy, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges like cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation in multilingual retrieval.

Method: The proposed method, MGR-CSC, unifies keywords into shared atoms to align semantics, compresses the identifier space, and uses dynamic multi-step decoding for efficient retrieval.

Result: MGR-CSC improves retrieval accuracy by 6.83% on mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing identifier length by 74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: MGR-CSC enhances cross-lingual retrieval performance and efficiency by providing a robust framework for multilingual retrieval challenges.

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

### [118] [AdaSwitch: Adaptive Switching Generation for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07842)
*Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Hengyi Cai,Yuchen Li,Kai Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaSwitch, a knowledge distillation method for small language models (SLMs) that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation to improve performance while addressing training-inference mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are important for latency- and computation-constrained scenarios but face challenges in achieving high performance. Knowledge distillation methods often face trade-offs between supervision quality and training-inference consistency.

Method: AdaSwitch dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy token generation by assessing the quality of student predictions in real-time. It enables students to explore their predictions while integrating high-quality teacher guidance selectively.

Result: AdaSwitch significantly improves accuracy in SLMs, as demonstrated through experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs. It achieves this with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: AdaSwitch offers an effective, practical solution to distilling knowledge into SLMs by addressing key limitations of existing on-policy and off-policy methods.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

*Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi,Md. Mahbub Alam,Subhey Sadi Rahman,Md. Adnanul Islam,Jannatul Ferdous Deepti,Tasnim Mohiuddin,Md Mofijul Islam,Swakkhar Shatabda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework and dataset called Translation Tangles to evaluate the quality and fairness of translations produced by large language models (LLMs), emphasizing low-resource languages and bias detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the varying performance of LLMs across languages and domains, and the existence of encoded biases in training data that disproportionately affect low-resource languages.

Method: The proposed framework evaluates translations across 24 language pairs and multiple domains using diverse metrics. A hybrid bias detection pipeline that combines rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and LLM-based validation is also introduced. Additionally, a bias-annotated dataset is created based on human evaluations.

Result: Translation Tangles successfully benchmarks translation quality and fairness, and provides a specialized dataset to analyze bias in translations.

Conclusion: The framework and dataset offer a comprehensive toolset to assess and improve the fairness and quality of machine translations, addressing biases and performance disparities in LLMs. The resources are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

*Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Anhad Mohananey,Alexandra Chronopoulou,Pinelopi Papalampidi,Somit Gupta,Tsendsuren Munkhdalai,Lu Wang,Shyam Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in large language models caused by overthinking during reasoning tasks, introducing TRACE as a tool to systematically analyze reasoning steps and proposing solutions based on observed patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning improves complex task performance but introduces inefficiencies like overthinking, where models conduct excessive reasoning without accuracy gains.

Method: The study benchmarks overthinking inefficiencies and uses TRACE to analyze thought processes by decomposing them into sub-thoughts, creating thought progression graphs, and identifying patterns such as "Explorer" and "Late Landing."

Result: TRACE analysis reveals over-verification and over-exploration as key contributors to overthinking, and introduces a utility-based definition of overthinking based on thought structure rather than just reasoning length.

Conclusion: The paper offers a refined understanding of overthinking causes and practical guidelines for managing LLM inefficiencies with TRACE, enhancing the principled design of reasoning models.

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

*Heyang Liu,Yuhao Wang,Ziyang Cheng,Ronghua Wu,Qunshan Gu,Yanfeng Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for testing language alignment in speech-to-speech systems, revealing performance deficits and proposing improvements that address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the deficiencies in language alignment seen in existing multimodal large language models used for speech-to-speech interactions.

Method: The authors propose a new benchmark termed CS3-Bench and introduce techniques like Chain of Recognition (CoR) and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to enhance model performance.

Result: The improvements led to a knowledge accuracy increase from 25.14% to 46.13% and an open-ended understanding rate rise from 64.5% to 86.5%, along with reduced pronunciation errors.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance language alignment capabilities of models, paving the way for more effective speech-to-speech systems.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework to improve weak-to-strong generalization using contrastive decoding to reduce noise and biases in training large language models, showing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the problems of noise and biases in weak-model outputs that hinder the robustness and generalization in the weak-to-strong training paradigm, limiting its usability in scaling language models.

Method: They leverage implicit rewards (approximated using log-likelihood ratios) and identify their structural equivalence with Contrastive Decoding. Using this insight, they devise ConG, which applies contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models for higher-quality sample generation.

Result: ConG shows consistent improvements across multiple model families, demonstrating its generality and robustness in transferring capabilities while reducing noise during weak-to-strong generalization.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that ConG can effectively address limitations in weak-to-strong generalization, offering a robust pathway toward improved training methods that may advance progress toward AGI.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

*Verena Blaschke,Miriam Winkler,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores transferring language understanding between standard and non-standard dialects, focusing on text, speech, and cascaded text-speech approaches, with German dialects as the use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current research that focuses heavily on text data, despite dialects being primarily spoken and challenging to process due to non-standard spellings.

Method: Comparison of three settings—text models, speech models, and cascaded transcription systems—using German and its dialects in intent and topic classification tasks. A dialectal audio intent classification dataset was also created and used.

Result: Speech-only models outperformed others on dialect data, text-only models were best for standard data, and cascaded systems performed decently on dialects if transcription produced normalized outputs.

Conclusion: Speech-based approaches are most effective for dialects, while text-based methods are better for standard language. Cascaded systems hold potential when transcription quality is high.

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

*Hyeonseok Moon,Seongtae Hong,Jaehyung Seo,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCBench, a benchmark to objectively evaluate LLMs' step-by-step execution of string-matching NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs are saturated and lack objective verification, necessitating challenging new benchmarks.

Method: MCBench uses deterministic and code-verifiable evaluation, providing reference code and designed benchmark variants for instruction understanding metrics.

Result: MCBench effectively measures LLMs' abilities in instruction adherence, numerical computation, and handling intermediate results while ensuring objective accuracy verification.

Conclusion: MCBench is a reliable tool for assessing the detailed instruction-following capabilities of frontier LLMs.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

*Jiayu Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Songning Lai,Shengen Wu,Jiaqi Tang,Chun Kang,Zhijiang Guo,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACE, a framework for improving knowledge editing (KE) in large language models (LLMs), particularly in multi-hop factual scenarios, by targeting neuron-level query-value pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for knowledge editing in LLMs show significant performance decay in multi-hop factual recall due to overlooking neuron-level dynamics in reasoning chains.

Method: Through causal analysis, the authors identified query-value neuron pathways and proposed Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing (ACE), which uses neuron-level attribution to locate and modify crucial pathways enabling multi-hop reasoning.

Result: ACE outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 9.44% improvement on GPT-J and a 37.46% improvement on Qwen3-8B.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that leveraging a neuron-level understanding of query-driven reasoning dynamics is critical for advancing knowledge editing capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced framework for auto-grading subjective questions across diverse formats and domains, showcasing superior performance and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges in automatically grading subjective questions caused by diverse question formats and open-ended student responses.

Method: The framework integrates four modules: basic text matching, key knowledge point comparison, pseudo-question generation, and simulated human evaluation using LLM capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over baselines, and deployment in real-world applications has been successful.

Conclusion: LLM-based framework provides comprehensive and effective auto-grading for all types of subjective questions, suggesting its utility in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stepwise Knowledge Distillation (StepER), a method to enhance reasoning abilities in multi-step retrieval-augmented language models (LMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods fail to account for diverse reasoning needs at each step during multi-step retrieval tasks, limiting the performance of LMs.

Method: StepER uses step-by-step supervision and difficulty-aware training to optimize learning across different stages, enabling the method to benefit models using retrieval paths or decomposed questions.

Result: The proposed StepER method shows superior performance over prior approaches and allows a smaller 8B model to perform comparably to a much larger 70B teacher model on multi-hop question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: The step-wise and difficulty-aware approach effectively enhances reasoning and retrieval abilities, indicating a significant improvement in multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B
teacher model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) for missing information or underrepresented viewpoints, proposing three automated strategies and finding the end-to-end approach surprisingly effective despite some trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of incomplete or selectively omitted key information in large language model (LLM)-generated outputs, which can cause harm, especially in sensitive domains.

Method: The study investigates three evaluation strategies: (1) NLI-based decomposition of texts to identify missing links, (2) comparison of question-answer pairs across sources, and (3) an end-to-end LLM-based identification of missing content.

Result: The end-to-end LLM-based approach was found to be surprisingly effective compared to more complex strategies, although it had drawbacks in robustness, interpretability, and granularity.

Conclusion: The research highlights the need to improve LLM comprehensiveness and assesses responses of popular open-weight LLMs, emphasizing the effectiveness and limitations of various evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

*Madis Jürviste,Joonatan Jakobson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The research explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to enrich 17th and 18th century Estonian historical dictionaries and apply text recognition to Gothic script sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for the semi-automatic enrichment of lesser-studied historical dictionaries and digitize archival materials, particularly in minor languages like Estonian.

Method: The study focuses on enriching dictionaries with modern word forms and uses vision-enabled LLMs for text recognition of texts in Gothic script. Techniques like overlapping tiling and structured output merging were employed.

Result: Initial experiments show LLMs provided modern equivalents for 81% of entries in Gutslaff's 1648 dictionary and structured 41% of headword entries into error-free outputs from Helle’s 1732 dictionary.

Conclusion: LLMs hold great potential for reducing resource needs in processing historical linguistic data, even for underrepresented languages like Estonian.

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for

### [130] [A$^2$Search: Ambiguity-Aware Question Answering with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07958)
*Fengji Zhang,Xinyao Niu,Chengyang Ying,Guancheng Lin,Zhongkai Hao,Zhou Fan,Chengen Huang,Jacky Keung,Bei Chen,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces A$^2$Search, an annotation-free framework for handling ambiguous questions in open-domain QA. It improves performance with a reinforcement learning-based approach and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems struggle with ambiguous questions and rely on benchmarks that assume single answers, overlooking the reality of multiple valid answers. Current efforts to address this require costly manual annotations, creating scalability issues for complex datasets.

Method: A$^2$Search employs an automated pipeline to detect ambiguous questions, samples alternative answers through trajectory sampling and evidence verification, and optimizes the model using RL with a custom-designed $
AnsF1$ reward that accommodates multiple answers.

Result: A$^2$Search achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight QA benchmarks. Specifically, the 7B model improves the $
AnsF1$@1 score to 48.4% on multi-hop datasets, outperforming significantly larger models like ReSearch-32B.

Conclusion: By effectively addressing question ambiguity without the need for manual annotations, A$^2$Search highlights the importance of embracing ambiguity in QA systems. It enhances reliability and generalization across benchmarks, setting a new standard for open-domain QA research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

### [131] [LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07962)
*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LightReasoner, a framework where smaller language models (SLMs) help improve the reasoning of larger models (LLMs) by identifying high-value reasoning moments. It reduces time and data requirements while enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiencies of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models, which demands significant resources and often fails to focus on tokens with meaningful learning value.

Method: The LightReasoner framework uses behavioral divergence between strong LLMs and weaker SLMs in two stages: a sampling stage identifies critical reasoning moments via expert-amateur contrast, and a fine-tuning stage aligns the LLM with these distilled examples.

Result: Using LightReasoner across seven mathematical benchmarks, the authors achieved up to 28.1% accuracy improvement, alongside significant reductions in resources, including a 90% drop in time consumption, 80% fewer sampled problems, and 99% less tuned token usage.

Conclusion: By utilizing weaker SLMs as teaching signals, LightReasoner provides a scalable, resource-efficient method for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities without requiring ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

### [132] [Active Confusion Expression in Large Language Models: Leveraging World Models toward Better Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07974)
*Jialu Du,Guiyang Hou,Yihui Fu,Chen Wu,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models struggle with social reasoning due to their inability to separate objective reality from subjective beliefs. The authors propose a dynamic world model mechanism to address these issues, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance social reasoning in LLMs, which currently exhibit confusion and inconsistencies in tasks requiring differentiation between objective events and agents' beliefs.

Method: The researchers developed an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that dynamically tracks entity states, timelines, and confusion indicators to intervene with clear descriptions when necessary.

Result: The new mechanism showed significant gains in performance across social benchmarks (+10% in accuracy for Hi-ToM) and reduced computational costs (up to 33.8% fewer tokens).

Conclusion: This adaptive reasoning approach offers a practical solution for improving LLMs' capabilities in handling social reasoning tasks efficiently and accurately.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

*Watcharapong Timklaypachara,Monrada Chiewhawan,Nopporn Lekuthai,Titipat Achakulvisut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system for generating highly accurate and stylistically consistent captions for scientific figures, leveraging textual context and author writing styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific figure captions play a crucial role in conveying visual information accurately, but ensuring consistency in style poses a challenge.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 optimizes category-specific prompts and selects caption candidates, while Stage 2 refines captions through few-shot prompting informed by author profile figures.

Result: Category-specific prompts significantly outperform generic methods, achieving better ROUGE recall (+8.3%) with minimal precision loss, and profile-informed refinement improves BLEU scores by 40–48%.

Conclusion: Combining contextual knowledge with stylistic adaptation results in scientifically accurate and stylistically consistent captions, advancing caption generation effectiveness.

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

TL;DR: MUSE is a framework to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with memory-based continuous learning, enabling better performance and task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents are static during test-time and cannot adapt or improve through accumulated experience, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: MUSE employs a hierarchical Memory Module for structuring and utilizing experience. After sub-task execution, it reflects and integrates experience autonomously to enable continuous learning.

Result: MUSE achieved state-of-the-art performance on the TAC benchmark using a lightweight model and demonstrated robust task completion, continuous learning, and zero-shot task generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MUSE sets a new paradigm for productivity-focused AI agents by demonstrating the potential of experience-driven self-evolving systems for real-world task automation.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates ChatGPT's effectiveness in Japanese-English translation through different prompts, document versus sentence-level approaches, and by comparing it to established translation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether ChatGPT can be a viable tool for Japanese-English translation and how different prompts and versions of ChatGPT perform in comparison to traditional translation engines.

Method: Analyzed ChatGPT's translations using automatic and human MQM-based evaluations, focusing on document-level vs. sentence-level outputs and enhancing simple prompts.

Result: Document-level translations were better than sentence-level ones. Enhanced prompts showed no clear advantage over simple prompts. ChatGPT-3.5 excelled in automatic evaluations for accuracy, while ChatGPT-4 showed better fluency. ChatGPT's performance was competitive with two well-established translation systems.

Conclusion: ChatGPT is a viable tool for Japanese-English translation, especially at the document level, but a tradeoff exists between accuracy and fluency in its versions. Enhanced prompts did not prove significantly better.

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

### [136] [Climate Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08043)
*Ivan Kuznetsov,Jacopo Grassi,Dmitrii Pantiukhin,Boris Shapkin,Thomas Jung,Nikolay Koldunov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper assesses the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to recall climate normals and capture global climate patterns, finding moderate accuracy but significant limitations in representing regional and altitude-specific details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably recall and reason about climate data, particularly for crucial climate-related applications where accuracy is essential.

Method: The study tested LLMs using a grid of climate-related queries (mean July 2-m air temperature for 1991-2020 at specified geographic locations) and compared their outputs against ERA5 reanalysis data. Geographic context descriptors were also varied.

Result: LLMs showed moderate accuracy in matching global climate patterns, with RMSE between 3-6°C and biases of ±1°C. Errors increased in mountainous or high-latitude regions, and adding geographical context improved performance by 27% on average.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in understanding present-day climate patterns but struggle with regional and altitude-specific details, as well as long-term temperature shifts. They require further refinement for accurate climate-related applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

TL;DR: The paper surveys Process Reward Models (PRMs), which evaluate reasoning at the step-level for advanced alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional alignment models only evaluate final answers, missing nuances in reasoning steps, prompting the need to improve reasoning evaluation and alignment.

Method: The authors explore PRMs by summarizing methods for generating process data, building PRMs, and employing them for scaling and reinforcement learning.

Result: Applications of PRMs span a variety of domains including math, code, text reasoning, robotics, and multimodal tasks, alongside emerging benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRMs offer a path toward fine-grained and robust reasoning alignment, uncovering open challenges and design considerations for future research.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedDTRE improves dialogue systems by using an adaptive aggregation approach in federated learning, resolving privacy and personalization challenges while enhancing model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in dialogue systems related to privacy preservation, personalization, overfitting from limited client data, and global information loss during federated learning.

Method: Introduces FedDTRE, a federated learning strategy that utilizes trustworthiness scores to adaptively regulate the influence of global models during local updates.

Result: Experimental findings indicate that FedDTRE enhances dialogue model performance and generates higher-quality dialogues.

Conclusion: FedDTRE provides an effective solution to balance privacy, personalization, and dialogue model generalization, addressing key issues in federated learning for dialogue systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

*Shramay Palta,Peter Rankel,Sarah Wiegreffe,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how arguments from large language models (LLMs) affect human and LLM plausibility judgments on commonsense answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLM-generated rationale explanations can influence human judgment and raise concerns about their impact on human cognition.

Method: Authors collected 3,000 human plausibility judgments and 13,600 from LLMs, analyzing the effect of PRO and CON rationales generated by LLMs.

Result: Human plausibility ratings changed based on exposure to LLM-generated rationales, indicating both increased and decreased perceived plausibility. LLMs exhibited similar patterns of influence.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly influence human beliefs, even in domains where humans are considered experts, highlighting a novel application of LLMs for studying psychology and cognition while raising ethical concerns.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

*Sherzod Hakimov,Roland Bernard,Tim Leiber,Karl Osswald,Kristina Richert,Ruilin Yang,Raffaella Bernardi,David Schlangen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the impact of reasoning enabled by large language models (LLMs) on negotiation skills across three languages using dialogue games. Enabling reasoning boosts performance but at a high computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge AI agents face in negotiation, which involves strategic reasoning, opponent modeling, and balancing cooperation with competition.

Method: The study systematically evaluates reasoning-enabled LLMs through a self-play setup, testing their performance, cost, language consistency, and strategic adaptation across commercial and open-weight models in three languages.

Result: Reasoning improves negotiation outcomes significantly, such as a 31.4% increase in GPT-5's performance, but entails a 400% computational cost. Open-weight models revert to English reasoning steps in multilingual tasks, while commercial models maintain language consistency.

Conclusion: Reasoning enhances collaboration and task complexity handling in negotiation, but its computational expense and language inconsistency in open-weight models highlight trade-offs for practical applications.

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses two AI models' ability to detect undisclosed sponsored Instagram posts and enhance legal reasoning transparency, proposing error taxonomies and evaluating regulatory text's impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of enforcing transparency in influencer marketing legally and reliably, highlighting the need for non-opaque and legally grounded systems.

Method: Using 1,143 Instagram posts, the paper compares two AI models under varying levels of legal knowledge prompts and explores reasoning errors for improving automated detection systems.

Result: Both models show high accuracy (F1 up to 0.93), but struggle with ambiguous cases and exhibit common errors like citation omissions and unclear references. Regulatory text improves explanation quality but not detection accuracy consistently.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel error taxonomy, a unique annotated dataset, and methodological insights that can help regulatory bodies streamline influencer content moderation processes based on solid legal foundations.

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the use of LLMs as judges for evaluating text, proposing methods to extract global policies from their decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing use of LLMs-as-a-judge for text evaluation, replacing human annotations, and the need to understand associated biases and risks.

Method: It introduces two algorithms: CLoVE for generating verifiable local explanations and GloVE for condensing local rules into global policies through clustering and summarization.

Result: The proposed methods were tested on seven datasets for harm content detection, showing high faithfulness to LLM decisions, robustness to text perturbations, and positive feedback in user studies.

Conclusion: The extracted global policies can reliably represent LLM decisions, enhancing understanding and user satisfaction, while providing robustness against adversarial challenges.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Genii, an unsupervised framework to mitigate judgment preference bias in LLM-based evaluators, outperforming supervised models without requiring human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judgment models often exhibit bias favoring their own responses, which undermines their reliability as evaluators. Addressing this bias is crucial for improving LLM alignment with human judgments.

Method: The authors propose Genii, a multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that integrates various LLM-based judgment models. It uses an unsupervised client-server polling mechanism to optimize agents iteratively.

Result: Genii demonstrates superior performance compared to supervised models trained on annotated data. It improves evaluation quality across client agents and reduces judgment preference bias, even with weaker server agents.

Conclusion: Genii effectively addresses judgment preference bias in LLM-based judgment models, advancing the reliability and accuracy of automatic LLM evaluation systems without needing human-labeled annotations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

*Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Julien Bouvier Tremblay,Xue-Yong Fu,Cheng Chen,Shashi Bhushan TN*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI Knowledge Assist, a system generating knowledge bases for contact centers from historical conversations, which demonstrated above 90% accuracy in answering queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact centers face challenges integrating conversational AI without a company-specific knowledge base.

Method: AI Knowledge Assist extracts QA pairs from historical conversations and fine-tunes a lightweight LLM on internal data.

Result: The system achieved over 90% accuracy when tested across 20 companies, using the LLaMA-3.1-8B model.

Conclusion: AI Knowledge Assist effectively addresses the cold-start problem for contact center chatbots, facilitating RAG-powered chatbot deployment.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

*Elena Khasanova,Harsh Saini,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Xue-Yong Fu,Cheng Chen,Shashi Bhushan TN*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DACIP-RC, a continual pre-training method that boosts domain adaptability of smaller LLMs in business conversational tasks, improving zero-shot performance without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of deploying smaller LLMs with limited zero-shot instruction-following capabilities and mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting in traditional fine-tuning methods.

Method: A novel continual pre-training method (DACIP-RC) that uses reading comprehension on conversation transcripts to generate diverse task instructions and responses, enhancing instruction generalization.

Result: The proposed DACIP-RC method significantly improves the zero-shot generalization performance across various business conversational tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DACIP-RC offers a unique and effective strategy for instruction pre-training using business conversational data, demonstrating a pathway for industries to leverage proprietary datasets for domain adaptation.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

### [146] [Beyond Over-Refusal: Scenario-Based Diagnostics and Post-Hoc Mitigation for Exaggerated Refusals in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08158)
*Shuzhou Yuan,Ercong Nie,Yinuo Sun,Chenxuan Zhao,William LaCroix,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of large language models unnecessarily refusing benign requests by proposing two benchmarks and lightweight solutions that improve model compliance without compromising safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often reject benign requests due to overly cautious safety measures, limiting their usability and effectiveness.

Method: The authors introduce two benchmarks (XSB and MS-XSB) to evaluate exaggerated refusals in single-turn and multi-turn scenarios, and propose three inference-time strategies (ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering) without requiring retraining.

Result: Experiments on instruction-tuned Llama models show substantial improvement in compliance with safe prompts while maintaining safety.

Conclusion: The paper provides a reproducible framework to diagnose and mitigate exaggerated refusals, proposing practical solutions to enhance the usability and safety of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

*Jian Xie,Zhendong Chu,Aoxiao Zhong,Kai Zhang,Mingzhe Han,Xin Fang,Jialie Shen,Qingsong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ARM2, a unified adaptive reasoning model using reinforcement learning and length-aware optimization to enhance efficiency and multimodal capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'over-thinking' problem in large reasoning models (LRMs), which generate unnecessarily long reasoning paths in simple tasks and lack a general framework for adaptive reasoning.

Method: The method involves ARM2, a reinforcement learning-driven reasoning framework with length-aware optimization, capable of natural language inference, multimodal reasoning, and executing code integration for efficiency.

Result: ARM2 matches the performance of traditional reasoning models while reducing token usage by over 70% on average.

Conclusion: ARM2 successfully balances performance and efficiency, presenting a unified solution for adaptive reasoning, and validating its design through extensive experiments and analysis.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

### [148] [MetricalARGS: A Taxonomy for Studying Metrical Poetry with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08188)
*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetricalARGS, a taxonomy for evaluating LLMs on metrical poetry tasks like analysis, retrieval, generation, and support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how advanced poetic forms can assess LLMs' reasoning and language mastery.

Method: Developing MetricalARGS taxonomy and applying it using Telugu language to establish evaluation metrics.

Result: MetricalARGS showcases tasks aligning with NLP objectives, offering insights into LLM capabilities via metrical poetry.

Conclusion: The taxonomy broadens understanding of LLMs' strengths and constraints in handling complex poetic structures.

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

### [149] [Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08191)
*Yuzheng Cai,Siqi Cai,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Lichao Chen,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Gang Li,Zongyi Li,Haojia Lin,Yong Mao,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel training-free method called Training-Free GRPO to improve large language model (LLM) agents' performance in specialized tasks, eliminating the need for parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with specialized real-world tasks due to limitations in integrating external tools and specific prompt strategies. Existing solutions like reinforcement learning are costly and prone to challenges like overfitting and data scarcity.

Method: The Training-Free GRPO method leverages group-relative semantic advantages instead of numerical ones and distills high-quality experiential knowledge iteratively during multi-epoch learning. This knowledge is integrated at the API level to guide the LLM's behavior without modifying the model parameters.

Result: The proposed method is validated on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks, outperforming fine-tuned small LLMs while requiring only a few dozen training samples and minimal resources.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO offers a cost-effective and efficient way to enhance LLM performance in specific tasks without parameter updates, addressing practical challenges like overfitting and scarcity of training data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

### [150] [Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through Function Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08203)
*Shaohua Zhang,Yuan Lin,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'function token hypothesis' which asserts that certain tokens (e.g., function words) govern memory retrieval and consolidation processes in large language models (LLMs). Experimental evidence is provided to support this hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of how LLMs consolidate and retrieve memory for their advanced abilities, such as knowledge memorization and reasoning.

Method: The authors analyze LLM behavior through experimental studies and bipartite graph analysis, identifying the role of function tokens in activating predictive features.

Result: Findings reveal that function tokens play a critical role in memory retrieval during inference and memory consolidation during pre-training, with a small set of tokens activating most predictive features.

Conclusion: The function token hypothesis shines light on how function words and similar tokens enable the memory mechanisms in LLMs. This understanding can aid in improving LLM design and training processes.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

### [151] [LLMs Learn to Deceive Unintentionally: Emergent Misalignment in Dishonesty from Misaligned Samples to Biased Human-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08211)
*XuHao Hu,Peng Wang,Xiaoya Lu,Dongrui Liu,Xuanjing Huang,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) can display emergent dishonesty and deceptive behavior beyond safety issues. They find misalignment risks in both direct fine-tuning and human-AI interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand whether the emergent misalignment observed in narrow domains, like unsafe coding, extends to dishonesty and deception in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: The authors fine-tuned open-source LLMs on misaligned completions across various domains and evaluated their dishonest behavior in multiple settings, including simulated human-AI interactions.

Result: The results showed that LLMs develop broadly misaligned dishonest behavior. Introducing as little as 1% misaligned data reduces honest behavior by over 20%, and biasing human-AI interactions with only 10% biased users exacerbates dishonesty.

Conclusion: This study highlights the risks of emergent misalignment related to dishonesty and deception, showing that such risks can arise not only from direct fine-tuning but also from downstream tasks and practical interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

*Qiang Yang,Xiuying Chen,Changsheng Ma,Rui Yin,Xin Gao,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SenWave, a fine-grained sentiment analysis dataset for COVID-19 tweets in five languages, suitable for nuanced analysis and compatibility with ChatGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of labeled data inadequacy and inappropriate sentiment labels in public COVID-19 datasets.

Method: Developing SenWave, a sentiment analysis dataset with both labeled and unlabeled multilingual tweets, and fine-tuning transformer-based models for classification.

Result: SenWave comprises 10,000 annotated tweets in English/Arabic, 30,000 translated tweets in other languages, and over 105 million unlabeled tweets. Pre-trained models were fine-tuned for accurate sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: SenWave provides a robust foundation for fine-grained sentiment analysis, facilitating nuanced understanding of public sentiment during complex global events like COVID-19.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

### [153] [Investigating Counterclaims in Causality Extraction from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08224)
*Tim Hagen,Niklas Deckers,Felix Wolter,Harrisen Scells,Martin Potthast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of focus on counterclaims (concausal statements) in causality extraction research by creating a new dataset and showing its importance for improving model accuracy in distinguishing causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in existing causality extraction datasets, which primarily focus on supporting relationships (procausal claims) while neglecting refuting relationships (concausal claims).

Method: The authors conducted a literature review, developed annotation guidelines, augmented the existing Causal News Corpus with concausal statements, and measured inter-annotator agreement. Additionally, they evaluated model performance with and without the integration of concausal data.

Result: The study achieved substantial inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s κ = 0.74) and demonstrated that without concausal data, models misclassify concausal statements as procausal. Incorporating the new dataset enables models to distinguish procausal and concausal claims effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating concausal statements is critical for accurate causality extraction, and the new dataset mitigates common classification errors, enhancing the understanding of causal reasoning within incomplete knowledge frameworks.

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

*Jingyu Zhang,Haozhu Wang,Eric Michael Smith,Sid Wang,Amr Sharaf,Mahesh Pasupuleti,Benjamin Van Durme,Daniel Khashabi,Jason Weston,Hongyuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents WaltzRL, a multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy to improve both safety and helpfulness in language models by balancing between rejecting unsafe content and avoiding overrefusals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to resolve the conflicting challenges of minimizing unsafe responses in LLMs while reducing overrefusals of benign but sensitive prompts, which existing approaches struggle to address.

Method: WaltzRL trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent collaboratively using a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) mechanism. The feedback agent proposes improvements, while the conversation agent evolves to incorporate these suggestions. At inference, unsafe or overly rejecting responses are improved, not discarded.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets show WaltzRL reduces unsafe responses significantly (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6%) as well as overrefusals (e.g., from 45.3% to 9.9%) compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: WaltzRL enhances safety alignment in LLMs by fostering co-evolution between conversation and feedback agents, improving safety without compromising general capabilities, and advancing the balance of helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

*Jannek Ulm,Kevin Du,Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using synthetic data generated by LLMs for training purposes, showing performance benefits in language modeling and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impending limitations of textual data availability for training LLMs by investigating synthetic data generation methods.

Method: Contrastive decoding is used to generate synthetic corpora by amplifying signals from better-performing models and mixing them with original training data.

Result: Using synthetic data improves performance on language modeling objectives and downstream tasks, with contrastive decoding showing advantages for reasoning skills.

Conclusion: Synthesized data generation methods, particularly contrastive decoding, can enhance LLM training, depending on the nature of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepMiner is a novel framework that enhances multi-turn reasoning in models by training with complex tasks and utilizing dynamic context windows, showing significant performance boosts across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to multi-turn reasoning struggle with handling long-horizon interactions effectively. There is a need for improved cognitive reasoning models to overcome context limitations and deepen reasoning capabilities.

Method: DeepMiner employs a reverse construction method to generate challenge-rich training data and introduces a dynamic context management strategy based on sliding window mechanisms, allowing models to process lengthy multi-turn contexts without external summarization.

Result: Training DeepMiner on Qwen3-32B yielded substantial improvements in search agent benchmarks, including a 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, outperforming prior models by 20%. It shows consistency across BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeepMiner's approach effectively resolves limitations in context length for multi-turn systems, enabling sustained interactions over nearly 100 turns, making it a valuable advancement for long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies neurons responsible for cultural understanding in large language models (LLMs) and examines their role in relation to cultural biases and model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cultural bias and limited representation of underrepresented cultures in large language models and explore the mechanisms of their cultural understanding.

Method: A neuron-level analysis was conducted using a gradient-based scoring method with filtering to identify neurons that drive cultural behavior, categorizing them into culture-general and culture-specific neurons.

Result: Less than 1% of neurons, concentrated in shallow-to-middle layers, were found to drive cultural understanding; suppressing these neurons degrades cultural benchmark performance by up to 30% while largely preserving general NLU tasks.

Conclusion: The findings shed light on how LLMs handle cultural knowledge and offer practical guidance for mitigating cultural biases and improving model training strategies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

### [158] [AutoRed: A Free-form Adversarial Prompt Generation Framework for Automated Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08329)
*Muxi Diao,Yutao Mou,Keqing He,Hanbo Song,Lulu Zhao,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper introduces AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt generation framework for evaluating LLM safety without reliance on seed instructions. It achieves superior efficiency and attack success compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the robustness and safety of Large Language Models is essential for building trustworthy AI systems, and the limitations of current seed-based red teaming methods need to be addressed.

Method: AutoRed employs a two-phase process: persona-guided adversarial instruction generation and an iterative reflection loop for refinement. Additionally, a verifier is used to enhance efficiency by assessing harmfulness without querying the models.

Result: AutoRed demonstrated higher attack success rates and better generalization on eight state-of-the-art LLMs compared to traditional seed-based red teaming approaches.

Conclusion: Free-form adversarial prompt generation, as implemented via AutoRed, offers a promising direction for enhancing Large Language Model safety evaluations and surpasses seed-based methods in effectiveness and diversity.

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

### [159] [Two-Stage Voting for Robust and Efficient Suicide Risk Detection on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08365)
*Yukai Song,Pengfei Zhou,César Escobar-Viera,Candice Biernesser,Wei Huang,Jingtong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting implicit suicidal ideation using a two-stage architecture combining lightweight and large language models, achieving high accuracy and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising global suicide rates and the stigma associated with seeking formal help necessitate innovative approaches to detect suicidal ideation, especially implicit expressions shared on social media.

Method: A two-stage voting architecture is employed: Stage 1 uses a lightweight BERT classifier for explicit cases, and Stage 2 addresses ambiguous inputs either through an LLM voting framework or a feature-based ML ensemble using psychological indicators extracted by prompt-engineered LLMs.

Result: The framework achieves high performance with 98.0% F1 on explicit cases and 99.7% F1 on implicit ones, effectively bridging the cross-domain gap while significantly lowering the computational cost of LLMs.

Conclusion: This study offers an efficient, interpretable approach for detecting explicit and implicit suicidal ideation using a novel combination of lightweight and large language models enhanced by psychological feature extraction.

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

### [160] [On the Relationship Between the Choice of Representation and In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08372)
*Ioana Marinescu,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In-context learning (ICL) performance in LLMs is influenced by the representation of labels and the number of demonstrations, but these factors act independently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL has demonstrated effectiveness in learning tasks from context. However, the relationship between representation quality and learning capacity remains unclear.

Method: The study introduced an optimization algorithm to vary label representations and tested ICL performance across different label sets, while varying the number of in-context demonstrations.

Result: Results showed that learning occurs regardless of label quality, but improvement efficiency depends on both label set quality and the LLM's parameter count. Representation quality shows consistent impact on baseline accuracy.

Conclusion: The representation and learning of in-context demonstrations are largely independent in ICL. This finding highlights novel dimensions of ICL's effectiveness in LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

### [161] [If Probable, Then Acceptable? Understanding Conditional Acceptability Judgments in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08388)
*Jasmin Orth,Philipp Mondorf,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) judge the acceptability of conditional statements and how this differs from human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding conditional acceptability is crucial for improving communication, reasoning, and decision-making based on hypothetical scenarios.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs from various families and sizes, analyzing their judgments using linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests to see how they consider conditional probability and semantic relevance.

Result: LLMs are shown to integrate conditional probability and semantic relevance to judge acceptability, but their consistency varies based on model architecture and prompting strategy, and they perform less consistently than humans.

Conclusion: LLMs partially mimic human-like processing of conditional acceptability, but larger models do not necessarily better align with human judgments.

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

*Noor Ul Zain,Mohsin Raza,Ahsan Adeel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight machine called Co$^4$ outperforms larger models GPT-2 and GPT-BERT in efficiency and performance using fewer training epochs and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address inefficiencies in deep learning models and demonstrate the potential of smaller, efficient architectures to challenge scaling laws.

Method: Co$^4$ is designed with a single layer, two heads, and 8M parameters. It operates at $O(N)$ cost and is evaluated using the BabyLM challenge benchmarks for both training efficiency and task performance.

Result: Co$^4$ significantly outperformed GPT-2 and GPT-BERT on zero-shot and fine-tuning metrics across various NLP tasks while requiring fewer resources.

Conclusion: Co$^4$ challenges conventional deep learning scaling paradigms by achieving high efficiency and strong task performance, prompting reevaluation of existing methodologies.

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

### [163] [ARES: Multimodal Adaptive Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Token-Level Entropy Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08457)
*Shuang Chen,Yue Guo,Yimeng Ye,Shijue Huang,Wenbo Hu,Haoxi Li,Manyuan Zhang,Jiayu Chen,Song Guo,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARES, a framework designed to adaptively allocate reasoning effort based on task difficulty, improving performance and efficiency in solving multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLRMs struggle to balance between overthinking simple tasks and underperforming on complex ones. This calls for a method that allocates reasoning effort dynamically based on task difficulty.

Method: ARES uses a two-stage approach: Adaptive Cold-Start to train on data aligned with task difficulty; and Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization, which employs high window-entropy tokens to guide exploration and reasoning depth dynamically.

Result: ARES outperforms other models in multimodal reasoning tasks, achieving better efficiency and closing the performance gap with commercial systems at lower inference costs.

Conclusion: ARES improves MLRMs' adaptive reasoning ability, demonstrating its potential across diverse benchmarks with both superior performance and reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

*Elisa Leonardelli,Silvia Casola,Siyao Peng,Giulia Rizzi,Valerio Basile,Elisabetta Fersini,Diego Frassinelli,Hyewon Jang,Maja Pavlovic,Barbara Plank,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the third edition of the LEWIDI shared task, focusing on developing disagreement-aware AI systems using new paradigms and evaluation metrics across four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI model training and evaluation by addressing human judgment variations and disagreements.

Method: The study extended LEWIDI benchmarks to include categorical and ordinal judgments across four datasets, adopting soft-label and perspectivist evaluation paradigms.

Result: The task attracted diverse participation, offering insights into methods for modeling variation and testing new evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: LEWIDI framework enhances resources, benchmarks, and findings to better facilitate disagreement-aware AI technologies.

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

### [165] [DeepPrune: Parallel Scaling without Inter-trace Redundancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08483)
*Shangqing Tu,Yaxuan Li,Yushi Bai,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DeepPrune, a method to increase efficiency in parallel reasoning for large language models by pruning redundant computation, achieving over an 80% reduction in token usage while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to solve computational inefficiency caused by inter-trace redundancy in parallel reasoning with multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where over 80% of results are redundant and waste resources.

Method: DeepPrune uses a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling for predicting equivalences in reasoning traces, combined with an online greedy clustering algorithm for dynamically pruning redundant computation paths.

Result: The method significantly reduces token usage by over 80% across three benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, GPQA) while maintaining competitive accuracy within a 3% margin.

Conclusion: DeepPrune improves the efficiency of parallel reasoning in LLMs, setting a new standard for high-performance reasoning and providing a method to effectively manage computational resources with minimal accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

### [166] [Neologism Learning for Controllability and Self-Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08506)
*John Hewitt,Oyvind Tafjord,Robert Geirhos,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces and evaluates the use of new words (neologisms) to better control and understand large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans create new words for emerging concepts, and similarly, introducing new words to LLMs could help to enhance their interpretability and functional control.

Method: The researchers added new word embeddings and trained the model with examples related to those words without altering other model parameters. They also introduced 'self-verbalization,' where models describe how they interpret the newly introduced words.

Result: The study demonstrated that new words could control various concepts such as flattery, incorrect answers, and text length. Self-verbalization revealed insights into how models understand these neologisms and identified machine-only synonyms that behave similarly to the new words.

Conclusion: Creating neologisms in LLMs enables better control over their behavior and insights into their internal representations. The self-verbalization approach validates the practical utility of this method.

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

*Hyunji Lee,Kevin Chenhao Li,Matthias Grabmair,Shanshan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a proxy prompt evaluator to enhance prompt optimization for fairness detection in Terms of Service clauses, improving accuracy and efficiency under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt optimization is crucial for improving language model performance on challenging tasks like fairness detection in legal NLP, but existing methods are often inefficient and computationally expensive.

Method: The authors use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in combination with a proxy prompt evaluator to reduce costs and increase effectiveness while navigating the prompt space.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed method achieves better classification accuracy and efficiency compared to baseline approaches under limited computational resources.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more effective and resource-efficient way to optimize prompts for tackling complex NLP tasks like fairness detection in ToS clauses.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

### [168] [Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525)
*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the excessive memory overhead of Key-Value (KV) caching in reasoning large language models during decoding. The proposed RLKV selectively compresses KV cache based on reasoning importance, achieving 20-50% reduction with negligible performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face challenges with memory-intensive KV caching during reasoning tasks, and current compression methods degrade performance significantly.

Method: RLKV, a reinforcement learning-based framework, identifies reasoning-critical attention heads via training-based reward optimization. Full KV cache is given to these heads, while others use compressed cache.

Result: The method demonstrates that only a small subset of attention heads is essential for reasoning, achieving 20-50% KV cache reduction without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: RLKV proves effective in optimizing memory use for reasoning tasks by selectively compressing non-critical KV cache, outperforming baseline methods without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), an RL-based framework enabling autonomous agent improvement via inter-agent interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of current RL-based self-evolution approaches for LLM agents that lack collaborative mechanisms resembling human intelligence.

Method: CoMAS uses inter-agent discussions to generate intrinsic rewards, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism, and optimizes agent policies via reinforcement learning.

Result: CoMAS outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance in most evaluations, proving robust scalability as agent diversity increases.

Conclusion: CoMAS establishes a novel paradigm for decentralized and scalable self-evolution in LLM-based systems by leveraging interaction-driven rewards and inter-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher is introduced as a framework to automatically evolve benchmarks for large language models, addressing the issue of data leakage from pretraining corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data leakage from pretraining causes models to match memorized content, misrepresenting progress and undermining benchmarks' validity.

Method: ArenaBencher iteratively evolves benchmarks by generating test cases, verifying their correctness using LLMs, and aggregating model feedback to select challenging cases.

Result: This framework demonstrates its effectiveness in generating fair and challenging benchmark updates across domains like math, reasoning, and safety.

Conclusion: ArenaBencher provides a scalable solution for evolving benchmarks to match the rapid advancements in foundation models, ensuring fair and diagnostic testing.

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time maritime object detection system enhanced with synthetic data and advanced techniques to address challenges from small target sizes and labeled data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection is challenged by small target sizes and a lack of labeled real RGB data, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The system uses RT-DETR combined with multi-scale feature fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and a balanced weighting strategy between synthetic and real data. Data augmentation techniques are employed for robustness.

Result: A full Python-based maritime detection pipeline is created with real-time performance. Component analysis quantifies the contributions of each module, and failure handling in extreme conditions is explored.

Conclusion: This system addresses challenges in maritime object detection while maintaining real-time performance, offering adaptability between speed and accuracy, and improving robustness with synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

Method: DynamicEval introduces curated prompts emphasizing camera motion, human annotations for video evaluation, error map-based metrics for background consistency, and a new foreground consistency metric.

Result: DynamicEval improves alignment with human preferences in video evaluation by over 2%, enhancing both video-level and model-level scoring.

Conclusion: DynamicEval offers a more robust benchmark for evaluating text-to-video models under dynamic camera motions, addressing previous shortcomings in assessment methods.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RISP, a new approach for solving imaging inverse problems with faster convergence and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imaging inverse problem solutions like RED focus on quality but lack a structured strategy for quick convergence.

Method: RISP employs restarted inertia to improve convergence speed and integrates score-based priors for high-quality image reconstruction.

Result: RISP proves faster convergence rates compared to RED and provides strong reconstruction quality across various imaging tasks.

Conclusion: RISP effectively balances the trade-offs between convergence speed and image quality, offering a significant improvement over existing methods like RED.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [174] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative denoising framework to address challenges in ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) caused by noise, artifacts, and spatial misalignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The significant noise, artifacts, and spatial misalignment in uLDCT images compared to NDCT images limit the performance of existing denoising models, creating a pressing need for a new approach.

Method: The authors created a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset and introduced an Image Purification (IP) strategy to align uLDCT and NDCT image pairs. They also proposed a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model synergistic with the IP strategy to enhance anatomical structure preservation in denoised images.

Result: Experiments on the clinical dataset showed that their IP strategy improved the effectiveness of multiple denoising models, and the FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieved state-of-the-art results in maintaining anatomical integrity.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust solution to the data mismatch issue in real-world uLDCT denoising, enabling both better noise reduction and structure preservation. The tools and dataset are publicly accessible for further research.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2RA, a training-free method to remove or weaken watermarks in images, highlighting vulnerabilities in current watermarking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of generative models has created a need for robust watermarking methods to ensure attribution and provenance of content. However, existing methods have weaknesses, especially when attacked under adversarial conditions.

Method: The authors propose D2RA, which projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermark signals, without relying on training or access to the underlying generative model.

Result: Experiments show that D2RA effectively reduces watermark detectability across various watermarking schemes while maintaining visual fidelity in the modified images.

Conclusion: D2RA exposes critical flaws in current watermarking approaches by demonstrating their lack of robustness against a simple, training-free attack strategy.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle introduces a video-to-video style transfer approach using diffusion models, addressing challenges with paired data availability by introducing style adapters and synthetic training clips while enhancing content-style guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve effective video style transfer using diffusion models while addressing the lack of paired video data for supervision.

Method: The paper employs a framework called PickStyle, which inserts low-rank adapters into self-attention layers, uses synthetic training clips with simulated camera motion, and introduces Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) for better context and style preservation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that PickStyle outperforms current baselines in achieving temporally coherent, style-accurate, and content-preserving video style transfer.

Conclusion: PickStyle effectively bridges the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video style transfer, setting a new standard for content-aligned and stylized video outputs.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights issues with video generative models producing sequences that defy physical laws and proposes TRAVL, a method to enhance physical plausibility detection in Video-Language Models, along with the benchmark ImplausiBench for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of modern video generative models to respect intuitive physical laws and the lack of quantitative methods to assess physical realism in video.

Method: Introduction of TRAVL, a fine-tuning approach with trajectory-aware attention, coupled with the development of ImplausiBench to benchmark physical plausibility in videos.

Result: Existing Video-Language Models revealed limitations in temporal and causal reasoning, but TRAVL improved motion encoding and discrimination capabilities. ImplausiBench offered a stringent evaluation metric, aligning human judgments with model performance.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench collectively enhance physical plausibility assessments in multimodal models, pushing forward a robust, unified framework to advance video realism and understanding.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) to enhance hyperspectral imaging classification by incorporating textual descriptions alongside spectral-spatial data, achieving improved performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces challenges like limited training samples, high data dimensionality, overfitting, and reliance on monomodal models solely using spectral-spatial data.

Method: S3FN integrates contextual textual descriptions from LLMs into the model, converts them into semantic vectors using text encoders like BERT or RoBERTa, and aligns them with spectral-spatial features for better classification.

Result: The approach demonstrated significant performance improvements across three HSI benchmark datasets: Hyperspectral Wood, Hyperspectral Blueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual semantics enhances spectral-spatial analysis, addressing existing challenges and opening doors for advanced HSI classification techniques.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the privacy concerns in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when handling sensitive visual and textual data, proposing an efficient unlearning framework called CAGUL for Visual Question Answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle privacy issues in VLMs which may memorize and leak sensitive information during inference, further complicated by the inclusion of visual data.

Method: The authors developed the Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) framework, leveraging cross-modal attention to transform low-importance visual tokens and encode unlearning information using external modules.

Result: CAGUL preserves the reference model behavior while effectively preventing privacy leaks, outperforming or matching finetuning-based baselines without requiring model retraining.

Conclusion: CAGUL provides a practical and efficient solution for unlearning in VLMs without altering pre-trained parameters, addressing privacy concerns in multi-modal tasks like VQA.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), an automated algorithm using YOLOv9 and UAV imagery to accurately count maize seedlings, offering scalability and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual maize counting is challenging due to its labor-intensity and the difficulty of large-scale deployment, necessitating a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: MaSC utilizes UAV-captured RGB imagery processed through a YOLOv9 model to detect maize seedlings in two modes: mosaic and raw video frames, combined with spatial distribution techniques for row-wise segmentation.

Result: MaSC achieved strong agreement with manual counts, demonstrating accuracy (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2= 0.906 for video frames) and efficient processing capabilities (83 frames in 60.63 seconds).

Conclusion: MaSC provides an effective, scalable, and low-cost solution for automated maize stand counting suitable for both research and production contexts.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) is an optimized Capsule Network designed for faster inference with minimal accuracy loss, achieving a speedup of 5x compared to traditional CapsNet on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capsule Networks outperform CNNs in certain tasks, like detecting overlapping digits and robustness to affine transformations, but suffer from slow training and testing speeds, limiting their real-time application potential.

Method: QCN reduces the number of capsules to streamline computations and introduces a more powerful decoder to maintain performance while improving speed.

Result: QCN demonstrates a 5x faster inference speed compared to traditional CapsNet, with marginal accuracy loss, across datasets such as MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN, and Cifar-10.

Conclusion: Quick-CapsNet offers a promising direction for faster, real-time applications of Capsule Networks, striking a balance between speed and accuracy by simplifying the architecture.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rectified-CFG++, an improved guidance method for diffusion models that stabilizes text-conditioned synthesis and avoids visual artifacts and off-manifold drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard classifier-free guidance (CFG) used in diffusion models struggles with off-manifold drift, causing issues like visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behavior in text-conditioned synthesis.

Method: The proposed Rectified-CFG++ approach uses adaptive predictor-corrector guidance to stabilize trajectories. It combines conditional rectified flow updates with weighted corrections of velocity fields to ensure geometry-aware conditioning and consistent inference.

Result: Rectified-CFG++ outperformed standard CFG across multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench, providing more stable and high-quality text-to-image synthesis.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ addresses limitations of CFG by ensuring that synthesis remains geometrically consistent while improving visual quality and reliability in text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

Motivation: To improve automatic perceptual quality evaluation of 3D point clouds without requiring reference data, leveraging advancements in large multimodal models.

Method: The authors design PIT-QMM, which integrates text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views to predict quality scores. Extensive benchmarking was conducted.

Result: PIT-QMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, requiring fewer training iterations. It also enables distortion localization and identification.

Conclusion: The study opens new pathways for explainability and interactivity in NR-PCQA using PIT-QMM, marking advancements in the quality assessment of 3D assets.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net), a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architecture for action segmentation in videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving action segmentation in continuous video streams, particularly by leveraging two-stream methodologies that can learn and align both frame-wise and action-wise features.

Method: The method introduces the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net), which incorporates a Temporal Context block for cross-attention-based feature fusion and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q-ActGM). It employs a Dual-Stream Alignment Loss combining relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses.

Result: DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (e.g., GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, EgoProcel), as well as extensive ablation studies showcasing the effectiveness of proposed components.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the success of a hybrid quantum-classical approach in enhancing action segmentation through the alignment of frame-wise and action-wise features, thereby outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OIE (Once is Enough), a video virtual try-on technique focusing on first-frame clothing replacement, paired with temporal guidance for subsequent frames, achieving high efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a solution for video virtual try-on that addresses challenges in dual-branch architectures adapted to Diffusion Transformer models, such as high parameter requirements and lack of temporal features in latent space.

Method: The OIE approach uses an image-based clothing transfer model for the initial frame, followed by pose and mask guidance to dictate the temporal priors for generating subsequent video frames.

Result: Experiments validate OIE's superior computational and parameter efficiency while maintaining top-tier performance.

Conclusion: OIE proves to be a highly efficient and effective strategy for video virtual try-on, leveraging first-frame editing for seamless generation of subsequent frames.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

Method: The authors utilize a popular automatic mask generation method during inference to segment subjects from the background. These masks are then applied to restrict image tokens to the subject on a second pass.

Result: The method enables the generation of images that better align with text prompts, especially for descriptions involving places and locations.

Conclusion: The approach improves text prompt and source image alignment compared to other personalization methods.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automated text box placement in advertisement and web page layouts using four methods, highlighting challenges and benefits of task-specific designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the balance between visual appeal and communication efficiency in automated layout design.

Method: Comparison between four methods: Transformer-based model, Phi3.5-vision, Gemini, and an extended Transformer for multiple images.

Result: Standard Transformer approaches generally perform better, but all methods struggle with very small text or crowded layouts.

Conclusion: Task-specific architectures are more effective for layout design, and further development is needed for handling complex cases.

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM
(Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images.
Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

### [188] [TCIP: Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid Network for Deformable Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07666)
*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel architecture, Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP), for deformable medical image registration to improve accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pyramid networks for medical image registration suffer from accumulation of misalignments in decoding layers and lack adaptive optimization for varying image deformation requirements.

Method: The authors propose: (1) Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) to reduce misalignment by extracting semantic features, suppressing irrelevant ones, and estimating deformation fields; and (2) a dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy to adaptively determine iteration counts for registration.

Result: Extensive experiments on three brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset show that TCIP surpasses state-of-the-art networks in registration accuracy with comparable speed and model size.

Conclusion: The proposed FERM and TCI modules improve deformable image registration and can generalize well when integrated with existing models. Ablation studies validate their individual effectiveness.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

### [189] [Controllable Video Synthesis via Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07670)
*Haoyi Duan,Yunzhi Zhang,Yilun Du,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video synthesis method is developed to enhance user control by combining fine and coarse adjustments. It leverages variational inference to reconcile multiple task constraints using video generation frameworks, aiming for better control, diversity, and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing video generative models, which are often restricted to fixed input formats and fail to support varying levels of user control across defined and undefined elements.

Method: The task is reformulated as variational inference, where the optimization minimizes step-wise KL divergence with an annealed sequence of distributions. A context-conditioned factorization technique is introduced to reduce solution modes and avoid local optima.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency in the generated video samples, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel method for video synthesis, effectively combining multiple video generation frameworks to achieve refined control and maintain video diversity and quality.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.

that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a framework combining pairwise and center-based methods for better image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of center-based hashing methods underutilizing local similarity while preserving their ability to capture global structures.

Method: A two-branch framework with iterative mutual learning between a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch, complemented by a mixture-of-hash-experts module.

Result: MLH consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of mutual learning and a mixture-of-hash-experts module effectively combines local and global structural information, enhancing large-scale image retrieval performance.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Repainter, a framework for enhancing e-commerce product images by removing intrusive elements using advanced reinforcement learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses issues with e-commerce product images where watermarks and promotional text hinder user engagement and advertising effectiveness, aiming to improve image clarity and appeal.

Method: The proposed method, Repainter, combines spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance context attention and uses a composite reward mechanism for balanced visual outcomes. The authors also contribute a high-quality e-commerce dataset.

Result: Repainter outperforms state-of-the-art inpainting methods, particularly in complex scenes with intricate compositions, achieving superior object removal and clearer product visuals.

Conclusion: Repainter is a promising solution for improving e-commerce product images by integrating advanced reinforcement learning methods and providing valuable datasets and benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SyncHuman, a novel framework for photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from a single image by combining multiview and 3D native generative models to overcome challenges posed by ambiguous poses and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing photorealistic 3D human models from single images is critical for applications such as films and video games but faces challenges due to self-occlusions and inaccuracies in current methods.

Method: The authors combine multiview generative and 3D native generative models, fine-tuning them jointly with pixel-aligned synchronization attention and introducing a feature injection mechanism to integrate 2D details into 3D shapes.

Result: The proposed SyncHuman framework achieves improved geometric accuracy and visual fidelity in 3D human reconstruction, outperforming existing methods, especially for challenging poses.

Conclusion: SyncHuman demonstrates effective integration of multiview and 3D modeling approaches, setting a promising direction for future advancements in 3D human model reconstruction.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComGS, a framework for efficient Gaussian-based 3D object-scene composition, solving challenges like baked radiance inconsistencies and inefficient lighting estimation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian-based methods struggle with realistic 3D object-scene composition due to baked appearance and shadow data, thus requiring advancements in relightable object reconstruction and lighting estimation.

Method: The paper introduces Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient relightable reconstruction and employs fine-tuned diffusion models for localized environment lighting estimation.

Result: The proposed framework achieves real-time, visually harmonious 3D composition with vivid shadows, running at 28 FPS and allowing rapid editing in 36 seconds.

Conclusion: ComGS resolves inefficiencies in current techniques by simplifying lighting estimation and leveraging SOPs for practical and high-quality 3D rendering suitable for immersive applications.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraLED is a two-stage framework using a single short-exposure RAW image to reconstruct ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes by addressing exposure correction and denoising for improved detail recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of reconstructing UHDR scenes, particularly in nighttime environments, with exposure disparities and difficulties in preserving both bright and dark region detail using traditional RGB-based methods.

Method: The study leverages a two-stage framework, UltraLED, employing exposure correction through a ratio map and a brightness-aware RAW denoiser. The approach uses only short-exposure RAW images for reconstruction, avoiding artifacts like ghosting and motion blur.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraLED achieves superior performance compared to existing single-frame UHDR reconstruction approaches. The study also introduces a 9-stop bracketing pipeline and a corresponding dataset to support realistic synthesis.

Conclusion: UltraLED provides a robust solution to UHDR reconstruction using single short-exposure RAW images, effectively balancing dynamic range and recovering dark region details without alignment issues or artifacts.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos using high-framerate event streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve the difficulty of handling large inter-frame motions when reconstructing 3DGS from low-framerate RGB videos, leveraging event cameras for their strengths in capturing motion despite lacking color data.

Method: They propose a framework that uses event motion priors to guide the optimization of deformation fields and introduce unsupervised fine-tuning, geometry-aware data association, motion decomposition, and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that their method surpasses existing approaches using images or event data, proving its efficacy in optimizing dynamic 3DGS.

Conclusion: Combining low-framerate RGB videos with high-framerate event streams can improve 3DGS reconstruction, and their method effectively utilizes event data to achieve better performance in both synthetic and real-world settings.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three UNet-based models for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance brain tumor segmentation accuracy and increase physicians' trust in deep learning models using XAI techniques.

Method: Three models (UNet, ResUNet, AttUNet) were trained and evaluated using XAI methods like Grad-CAM and attention visualization on the BraTS2020 dataset.

Result: ResUNet outperformed other models in metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, while XAI methods provided model insights.

Conclusion: ResUNet is recommended for automated brain tumor segmentation, supported by XAI techniques for improved transparency and reliability.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTR-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate geographic spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) through video and map-based reasoning. Current VLMs significantly lag behind human performance in these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal reasoning across multiple perspectives using both videos and graphics, which is crucial for applications like traffic management.

Method: The authors propose GTR-Bench, a benchmark requiring reasoning across maps and non-overlapping video contexts, and temporal inferences in unobserved regions.

Result: Testing of over 10 VLMs on GTR-Bench shows significant performance gaps, with the best model achieving only 34.9% compared to human performance at 78.61%.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench reveals deficiencies in VLMs concerning spatial-temporal context utilization, temporal forecasting, and map-video alignment, offering avenues for further research and improvement in spatial-temporal intelligence.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thi Duyen Ngo,Thanh Ha Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-COF, a new motion representation integrating both micro-expression phases, and FMANet, a neural network leveraging dual-phase analysis for superior micro-expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to their subtle and brief nature as well as the focus of existing methods only on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the apex-to-offset phase.

Method: The authors propose MM-COF to unify motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases and develop FMANet, an end-to-end neural network, to adaptively analyze and classify micro-expressions.

Result: The proposed approach, evaluated on standard benchmarks like MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM, outperforms existing methods in accuracy and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Integrating dual-phase analysis through a learnable framework enhances the recognition of facial micro-expression, paving the way for advancements in this field.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

### [200] [An End-to-End Room Geometry Constrained Depth Estimation Framework for Indoor Panorama Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07817)
*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a depth estimation framework for indoor panoramas using room geometry constraints and background segmentation mechanisms to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular pixel-depth estimation methods focus excessively on pixel-level accuracy, leading to issues like oversmoothed corners and sensitivity to noise.

Method: The framework combines a shared feature encoder with task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. Additionally, it utilizes room geometry constraints and two novel strategies: a background depth resolving strategy and a segmentation-guided fusion mechanism.

Result: Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets indicate the proposed framework outperforms current open-source methods significantly.

Conclusion: The integration of room geometry constraints into the depth estimation process addresses limitations of oversmoothing and noise sensitivity, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

### [201] [Enhancing Visual Prompting through Expanded Transformation Space and Overfitting Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823)
*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACAVP, a method to improve Visual Prompting (VP) for vision model adaptation, addressing limitations like expressivity and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach of VP, which suffers from lower accuracy and overfitting while adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks.

Method: The paper proposes ACAVP, combining affine transformation, color transformation, and additive elements to improve VP's expressiveness, along with TrivialAugment for reducing overfitting.

Result: ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing, and demonstrates superior robustness to distribution shifts in experiments across twelve datasets.

Conclusion: ACAVP proves effective in enhancing VP approaches, demonstrating its utility in improving performance and robustness of vision model adaptations.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMHOI, a dataset for studying multi-human multi-object interactions in 3D, along with MMHOI-Net, a neural network framework for analyzing it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks cover limited aspects of human-object interactions, failing to represent complex real-world scenarios involving multiple humans and objects.

Method: A structured dual-patch representation is utilized in MMHOI-Net, a transformer-based network that jointly estimates 3D geometries, interactions, and action classifications.

Result: MMHOI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality when evaluated on MMHOI and CORE4D datasets.

Conclusion: MMHOI and MMHOI-Net provide a comprehensive framework for advancing next-generation human-object interaction research in terms of dataset complexity and prediction capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS addresses aliasing issues in scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing multi-scale supervision and size regularization, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address aliasing artifacts like flickering textures and jagged edges that occur when scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to large urban environments, especially in high-resolution rendering.

Method: PrismGS introduces two regularization techniques: (1) Pyramidal multi-scale supervision to enforce rendering consistency and mitigate flickering by learning anti-aliased representations and (2) Size regularization to prevent the formation of unstable, view-dependent Gaussian primitives.

Result: PrismGS achieves significant improvements with approximately 1.5 dB PSNR gains over CityGaussian and delivers stable, high-quality 4K rendering in urban scenes.

Conclusion: PrismGS successfully enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting by resolving fidelity gaps, ensuring robustness, and achieving high-quality performance in large urban scene rendering at high resolutions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

*Harsh Kavediya,Vighnesh Nayak,Bheeshm Sharma,Balamurugan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IsoSignVid2Aud, an end-to-end framework for translating sign language videos of isolated signs directly to intelligible speech, bypassing text representation for faster communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of connecting hearing- and speech-challenged individuals to others through efficient sign-to-speech translation, especially for isolated, non-grammatical sign sequences, drives the research.

Method: The framework combines I3D-based feature extraction, specialized feature transformation networks, an audio generation pipeline, and a novel Non-Maximal Suppression algorithm for detecting temporal sign sequences.

Result: IsoSignVid2Aud achieves Top-1 accuracies of 72.01% (ASL-Citizen-1500) and 78.67% (WLASL-100) while generating intelligible speech with metrics PESQ: 2.67 and STOI: 0.73.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates competitive performance in sign-to-speech translation for isolated signs, ensuring immediate communication, eliminating text representation latency, and minimizing errors.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

*Yijie Gao,Houqiang Zhong,Tianchi Zhu,Zhengxue Cheng,Qiang Hu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS is a novel framework for 3D indoor scene reconstruction that actively integrates semantic understanding to guide geometry formation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating semantically rich 3D indoor models from sparse views faces geometric ambiguity, and current methods fail to fully utilize semantic information as an active force in addressing this challenge.

Method: AlignGS employs 2D foundation models to distill semantic priors and uses innovative semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, such as depth consistency and multifaceted normal regularization, for joint optimization of geometry and semantics.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods in standard benchmarks for novel view synthesis and displays superior geometric accuracy in sparse-view scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic priors as geometric regularizers enhances the robustness, coherence, and completeness of 3D reconstructions, showcasing the potential for improved sparse-view 3D modeling.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of analyzing toxicant effects in high-throughput toxicity testing using machine learning approaches.

Method: Utilized self-supervised learning to analyze data from the EmbryoNet dataset, which includes ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes impacted by various chemical compounds.

Result: Learned representations through self-supervised learning effectively identified toxicant-induced changes and distinguished between compounds' modes of action.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential for integrating machine learning in automated toxicity testing platforms, like the TOXBOX project.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

*Haochen Yu,Qiankun Liu,Hongyuan Liu,Jianfei Jiang,Juntao Lyu,Jiansheng Chen,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder is a feedforward reconstruction model that leverages a cylinder-based method to overcome limitations in generalization and accuracy when reconstructing driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feedforward paradigms struggle with reconstruction in driving scenes due to fixed view transformations and sparse panorama overlaps, limiting generalization and accuracy.

Method: The model introduces Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) for adaptable camera configurations and Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) for improved feature lifting to 3D space.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with enhanced generalization in zero-shot driving scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder significantly advances scene reconstruction by addressing key challenges in camera modeling and feature representation, showcasing adaptability and accuracy across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARC, a token compression method for video-based visual language models, reducing computational needs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual language models face inefficiency extending from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations, creating a need for effective token compression without losing information.

Method: The proposed MARC method combines structured retrieval via a Visual Memory Retriever (VMR) and reinforcement-learning-based distillation using the Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) framework.

Result: MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy while reducing visual tokens by 95%, GPU memory by 72%, and latency by 23.9% across six video benchmarks.

Conclusion: MARC is a powerful tool for efficient and real-time video understanding, proving useful for applications like video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in anomaly detection include limited abnormal samples, high annotation costs, and the lack of systematic evaluation of anomaly synthesis algorithms.

Method: The authors propose a benchmarking framework called ASBench, which evaluates anomaly synthesis on dimensions like generalization, synthetic-to-real data ratio, intrinsic metrics correlation, and hybrid synthesis strategies.

Result: ASBench experiments reveal performance limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods and identify critical insights for improvement.

Conclusion: The framework provides a new standardized platform for anomaly synthesis evaluation and paves the way for enhanced research directions and practical applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of accurately identifying objects in visual scenes when faced with ambiguous situations and multiple candidate objects.

Method: Proposes the ERU framework which incorporates LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map usage, and a depth-aware decision module for integrating linguistic and embodied cues.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over existing baselines in referent detection, based on experiments conducted on two datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances disambiguation capabilities, offering more accurate and reliable embodied reference understanding in complex environments.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework called TTOM that improves compositional video generation for Video Foundation Models (VFMs) by enhancing text-video alignment during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of Video Foundation Models in compositional tasks, such as handling motion, numeracy, and spatial relationships, where they struggle to align generated videos with textual inputs effectively.

Method: The proposed method, TTOM, utilizes test-time optimization combined with a memory mechanism. Instead of directly altering latent spaces or attention per sample, it introduces new parameters guided by a layout-attention objective and employs a memory system to maintain and manage historical optimization contexts.

Result: TTOM achieves significant improvements in compositional video generation, enabling VFMs to better align video content with textual descriptions. Experiments on T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks validate its effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates powerful transferability, generalization, and scalability, making it a practical and efficient tool for compositional video generation in cross-modal scenarios.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the demand for high-fidelity video generation and depth estimation in autonomous driving, which requires both visual quality and meaningful geometric information.

Method: Fine-tune a spatial-temporal VAE with 4D reconstruction tasks to encode 3D structures and dynamics, then integrate it into a video diffusion process for improved quality. Incorporate a Gaussian Splatting Decoder to reconstruct dynamic scenes.

Result: The model shows substantial improvements in FID and FVD metrics and provides valuable geometric information through effective scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed CVD-STORM model excels in generating diverse, high-quality, and geometrically informative multi-view videos suitable for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Gaze on the Prize," a technique that uses a learnable attention mechanism to help visual RL agents focus on task-relevant features, leading to improved sample efficiency and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL agents struggle to efficiently learn in environments where only a small part of high-dimensional visual data is relevant to tasks.

Method: A foveal attention mechanism guided by return differences is used to distinguish task-relevant features through return-guided contrastive learning.

Result: The method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and solves tasks that baselines fail on, tested across manipulation tasks from ManiSkill3.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances RL agents' learning stability and efficiency without altering the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnimeText, a comprehensive dataset for detecting text in anime scenes. It contains 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks designed to handle anime-specific challenges like irregular arrangements and stylized fonts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the observation that current text detection datasets are tailored to natural or document scenes and fail to accurately handle unique characteristics of text in anime, such as diverse styles, irregular arrangements, and interference from visual elements.

Method: The authors created AnimeText, a novel dataset specifically for anime scenes, with hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples. Experimental evaluations were carried out using state-of-the-art text detection methods.

Result: Models trained on AnimeText demonstrated superior performance in detecting anime scene text compared to those trained on existing datasets, as validated through cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: AnimeText addresses a critical gap in text detection tasks for anime scenarios and offers superior robustness and performance, encouraging future improvements in this domain.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

*Nikolaos Stathoulopoulos,Christoforos Kanellakis,George Nikolakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-based deep compression framework for 3D point clouds in robotic systems, achieving up to 98% data size reduction while maintaining structural and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient transmission of large and complex 3D point cloud data in robotic systems is essential due to increasing reliance on edge and cloud computing under bandwidth and connectivity constraints.

Method: The method involves decomposing point clouds into semantic patches, encoding them with semantic-aware encoders using FiLM modulation, and decoding through a folding-based approach guided by latent features and graph attributes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art compression rates on datasets like SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and the framework supports applications like pose graph optimization and map merging with accuracy comparable to raw LiDAR data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly reduces data size while preserving fidelity and enabling effective downstream applications, addressing critical challenges in data transmission for robotic systems.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

*Yifang Yin,Shengkai Chen,Yiyao Li,Lu Wang,Ruibing Jin,Wei Cui,Shili Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimCast and CasCast, novel approaches to improve precipitation nowcasting accuracy using short-to-long term knowledge distillation, weighted MSE loss, and integration with diffusion-based frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate precipitation nowcasting is crucial for societal needs such as disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization.

Method: SimCast utilizes short-to-long term knowledge distillation with weighted MSE loss to focus on heavy rainfall regions, while CasCast integrates deterministic predictions into a diffusion-based framework for improved probabilistic modeling.

Result: The proposed framework achieves mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: The SimCast and CasCast frameworks provide improved precipitation nowcasting results without additional inference overhead, overcoming limitations of deterministic models like blurriness and distribution shift.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Memoir, a method to address limitations in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by integrating predictive retrieval of both environmental observations and navigation behaviors through a world model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN approaches lack effective memory mechanisms and largely ignore navigation behavioral patterns, constraining decision-making strategies.

Method: Memoir uses a language-conditioned world model to imagine future navigation states for memory retrieval and introduces hybrid viewpoint-level memory to store observations and behavioral patterns. An experience-augmented navigation model incorporates retrieved knowledge for improved navigation.

Result: Memoir significantly outperforms existing baselines in diverse VLN benchmarks, achieving 5.4% SPL improvement on IR2R, with 8.3x faster training speed and 74% memory reduction during inference.

Conclusion: Predictively retrieving and leveraging both environmental and behavioral memories enhances VLN performance, validating the potential of imagination-guided navigation frameworks and showing room for further improvement.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

*Yidi Liu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that enhances Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for UHD image restoration by maintaining high-frequency details and improving reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of VAEs in UHD image restoration, particularly their tendency to lose high-frequency, degradation-specific information due to Gaussian constraints in the latent space.

Method: The proposed method, Latent Harmony, consists of two stages: Stage One improves semantic robustness and high-frequency reconstruction via LH-VAE, while Stage Two refines the VAE and introduces High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA) to recover high-fidelity details and realistic textures, using alternating optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance in UHD and standard-resolution image restoration tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: Latent Harmony redefines the use of VAEs for UHD restoration by integrating advanced latent-space regularization techniques and novel optimization methods, offering a flexible and efficient solution for high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [219] [ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562)
*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD, a Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework, is proposed to address spatio-temporal imbalance in end-to-end autonomous driving by shifting from trajectory prediction to residual deviation prediction, improving model performance on NAVSIM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving systems face challenges from spatio-temporal imbalances in trajectory data, leading to spurious correlations and risks in immediate safety.

Method: ResAD introduces a Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling approach that predicts deviations from an inertial reference and optimizes the imbalance over uncertain long-term predictions using Point-wise Normalization.

Result: Experiments show that ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 on the NAVSIM benchmark with simplified learning requirements, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ResAD addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous driving trajectory prediction, providing a more effective framework by encouraging causality-driven learning and reducing optimization imbalances.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

### [220] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates the effectiveness of object and abstract tags for image privacy tasks, finding abstract tags more useful when tag quantity is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve image privacy classification by understanding the impact of tag type (object vs. abstract) and quantity.

Method: The paper compares the efficacy of object tags and abstract tags for image privacy classification under different tag quantity scenarios.

Result: Abstract tags outperform object tags when the number of tags per image is restricted, while object tags are equally effective with a larger tag budget.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the importance of choosing the right tag type and quantity for accurate image privacy classification systems, potentially influencing future research directions.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

*Chandresh Sutariya,Nitin Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares the high-cost Transformer-based SwinIR model with a lightweight CNN for low-light image restoration, finding CNN to be a more efficient alternative while still competitive in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of simultaneously restoring high-frequency details and suppressing severe noise in low-light imagery, while reducing the computational complexity of current state-of-the-art models like SwinIR.

Method: The paper evaluates the trade-offs between performance and efficiency by conducting experiments comparing the Transformer-based SwinIR and a standard lightweight CNN on low-light image restoration.

Result: SwinIR achieves a higher PSNR of 39.03 dB but requires 132 training epochs and is computationally demanding, whereas the CNN achieves a competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB, converges in just 10 epochs, and is significantly smaller in size (over 55 times smaller).

Conclusion: A lightweight CNN offers a highly efficient and competitive alternative to resource-intensive Transformer models like SwinIR for low-light image restoration, making it suitable for real-world resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphEnet, a Graph Neural Network designed to estimate 2D Human Pose at high frequency using event-based cameras and a novel event representation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing use of event-based cameras for their low latency and energy efficiency, there is a need to develop effective human pose estimation techniques using such cameras, which are ideal for resource-limited applications.

Method: The authors propose GraphEnet, a Graph Neural Network framework that utilizes a line-based event representation and incorporates a new offset vector learning approach with confidence-based pooling for efficient pose estimation.

Result: GraphEnet successfully estimates the 2D Human Pose of a single person with high-frequency outputs and leverages the sparsity of event camera data.

Conclusion: This work is the first to apply Graph Neural Networks to event camera data for Human Pose Estimation, and it provides an open-source implementation for further exploration.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

*Weihuang Lin,Yiwei Ma,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CIR-CoT, a retrieval-oriented multimodal model incorporating Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve compositional image retrieval accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional Image Retrieval (CIR) requires understanding and reasoning between visual and semantic inputs, but existing models lack transparency and struggle with fine-grained instructions.

Method: The authors propose CIR-CoT, which uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within a multimodal framework. The model is fine-tuned through structured annotations and integrates reasoning before encoding retrieval intent.

Result: CIR-CoT delivers competitive results on in-domain datasets such as FashionIQ and CIRR, while excelling in out-of-domain generalization on the CIRCO dataset.

Conclusion: The paper highlights CIR-CoT as a step forward in effective and interpretable retrieval, combining structured CoT reasoning with strong performance metrics.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

TL;DR: RayFusion is a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception, designed to improve depth estimation and detection performance in camera-based systems, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based 3D object detection systems struggle with depth estimation due to the lack of explicit depth information. Collaborative visual perception aims to address these limitations.

Method: RayFusion uses ray occupancy information from collaborators to reduce redundancy and false positives in depth predictions along camera rays.

Result: Experiments show RayFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in collaborative visual perception tasks.

Conclusion: RayFusion significantly improves camera-based collaborative visual perception systems' detection capabilities, overcoming depth estimation challenges effectively.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

TL;DR: RASALoRE is a new weakly supervised anomaly detection framework for brain MRIs, offering state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection in brain MRI scans using weak labels, addressing the challenge of precise pixel-level annotations being unavailable.

Method: RASALoRE employs a two-stage framework: DDPT mechanism for generating weak pseudo masks and a segmentation model with region-aware spatial attention based on random location-based embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets (BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, MSD) with less than 8 million model parameters.

Conclusion: RASALoRE enhances anomaly detection in brain MRIs while reducing computational cost, making it an effective and efficient approach.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetouchLLM is a training-free, transparent system for high-resolution image retouching, focusing on interpretable code-based adjustments without relying on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image retouching approaches rely heavily on large-scale paired datasets and lack transparency, limiting adaptability for diverse user or image-specific needs.

Method: The system has two key modules: a visual critic for identifying input-reference differences and a code generator for creating executable retouching codes. It emphasizes multi-step retouching, similar to human methods.

Result: Experiments show RetouchLLM effectively adapts to various retouching styles and enables interpretable, user-controlled adjustments via natural language interaction.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM offers an innovative, training-free and transparent solution for adaptable, high-resolution image retouching that prioritizes user intent and interactivity.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modified ResNet architecture for hierarchical time series classification of multispectral images with effective handling of class hierarchy and limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the classification of time series multispectral images by addressing hierarchical class structure and enabling robust learning in scenarios with limited training samples.

Method: The method involves modifying ResNet with additional branches for hierarchical classification, hierarchical-penalty maps for coherence, and class-hierarchy labels for efficient training across macro and micro-class levels.

Result: Experimental results on Sentinel 2 images of the Amazonian Forest demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in classifying both general and specific classes accurately, including proper representation of minoritarian classes.

Conclusion: The proposed modular network is effective for detailed classification tasks while providing adaptability, scalability, and the ability to fine-tune on new targets, showcasing strong potential for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods and benchmarks struggle to address challenges posed by real-world, diverse, and evolving deepfake technologies, leaving a gap between academic research and practical application.

Method: The authors propose the RedFace dataset, which incorporates deepfakes generated by 9 commercial online platforms and bespoke algorithms, mimicking real-world black-box conditions to present more diverse and realistic scenarios.

Result: Experimental results using RedFace demonstrate that current deepfake detection methods perform poorly in real-world settings, highlighting the data's potential to identify gaps in existing approaches.

Conclusion: RedFace bridges the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deepfake detection scenarios, enabling deeper insights into the limitations of current detection methods and fostering further research in this domain.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

*Shuhai Zhang,ZiHao Lian,Jiahao Yang,Daiyuan Li,Guoxuan Pang,Feng Liu,Bo Han,Shutao Li,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-generated videos have achieved realistic visuals, making detection critical. The paper introduces NSG and NSG-VD for more accurate detection based on physics principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos pose a threat to video authenticity, highlighting the need for sophisticated detection mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose NSG, a statistic based on probability flow conservation principles, and NSG-VD, a detection method combining NSG features with MMD metrics.

Result: NSG-VD outperformed other methods by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score through experiments.

Conclusion: Physics-driven NSG enables higher detection accuracy, addressing the challenge posed by AI-generated videos.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

*Ziqi Zhou,Menghao Deng,Yufei Song,Hangtao Zhang,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang,Dezhong Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DarkHash, the first data-free backdoor attack method against deep hashing models, achieving high attack efficiency while preserving retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of implanting backdoors in deep hashing models without access to the original training dataset, due to privacy and intellectual property concerns, while preserving their performance.

Method: The authors propose a shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance, fine-tuning specific layers using a surrogate dataset. They introduce topological alignment loss to enhance attack capability by optimizing poisoned samples.

Result: Experiments on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods show that DarkHash surpasses state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods and resists mainstream defense approaches.

Conclusion: DarkHash represents a novel solution to data-free backdoor attacks in deep hashing models, effectively balancing attack success and maintaining retrieval performance.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

*Ankit Gahlawat,Anirban Mukherjee,Dinesh Babu Jayagopi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of accurate face parsing under extreme poses by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve segmentation mask quality, enabling better model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data for face parsing in extreme viewing angles makes improvements necessary, as manual annotation is costly and impractical at large scales.

Method: The authors propose a label refinement pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting on RGB images and noisy multiview segmentation maps, enforcing multiview consistency and synthesizing training data.

Result: The fine-tuned face parsing model achieves higher accuracy on challenging head poses while maintaining performance on standard views, as shown by extensive experiments and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that their scalable method achieves superior face parsing accuracy without requiring ground-truth 3D annotations, offering robustness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

*Eirik A. Østmo,Kristoffer K. Wickstrøm,Keyur Radiya,Michael C. Kampffmeyer,Karl Øyvind Mikalsen,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a CT-specific augmentation, Random Windowing, to address the limitations of intensity augmentations in CT imaging, improving robustness in liver tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising importance of automated segmentation models in Contrast-enhanced CT imaging for medical diagnosis has been hampered by poor generalization when using intensity augmentations, which are poorly suited to the nature of CT intensities measured in Hounsfield Units.

Method: The authors introduce Random Windowing, a CT-specific augmentation approach that leverages the Hounsfield Unit distribution to enhance model robustness, particularly under challenging imaging conditions.

Result: The proposed Random Windowing method demonstrated superior performance in liver tumor segmentation tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, even with limited datasets.

Conclusion: Random Windowing improves generalization and segmentation accuracy in CT imaging while addressing intrinsic modality-specific challenges, offering advances in automated medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

*Kesen Zhao,Jiaxin Shi,Beier Zhu,Junbao Zhou,Xiaolong Shen,Yuan Zhou,Qianru Sun,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-Drag introduces an RL-enhanced autoregressive approach for real-time and motion-controllable image-to-video generation, addressing latency, quality, and control issues in previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with real-time applications due to latency and limited control signals, undermining their usability for motion-controllable tasks.

Method: The proposed AR-Drag model combines fine-tuning of a base image-to-video diffusion model with reinforcement learning, using trajectory-based rewards and a Self-Rollout mechanism to optimize motion control and training efficiency.

Result: AR-Drag achieves superior visual fidelity and motion accuracy while significantly reducing generation latency, with a model size of only 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: AR-Drag provides an effective solution for real-time video synthesis with diverse motion control, advancing video generation technologies.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

### [234] [Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08138)
*Chengzhi Li,Heyan Huang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Yaning Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates logical inconsistencies in Video-Language Models (Video-LLMs), proposing an attention enhancement technique (TCAS) to improve temporal understanding and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the reliability issues in Video-LLMs, where self-contradictory outputs hinder practical adoption, focusing on the failure in providing consistent responses to rephrased questions grounded in video tokens.

Method: The authors leverage interpretability-driven analysis to diagnose the problem, identify cross-modal attention deficiencies, and introduce Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) to enhance temporal resolution and improve logical consistency.

Result: Experiments show that TCAS significantly improves temporal logic consistency and discriminability in Video-LLMs, along with performance gains in general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal logic consistency is a crucial bottleneck in video understanding. The proposed TCAS method tackles this issue effectively, pushing forward advancements in temporal understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMMVSR, a unified generative video super-resolution framework combining text, images, and videos for producing high-resolution video outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video super-resolution methods fail to incorporate multi-modal generative conditions beyond text, limiting fidelity and usability.

Method: The study explores condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture approaches within a latent video diffusion model, while designing distinct methods to utilize varied conditions effectively.

Result: UniMMVSR significantly surpasses existing methods by generating videos with better detail and adherence to multi-modal conditions.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR sets a new benchmark in multi-modal guided video super-resolution, even enabling the generation of 4K videos, previously unattainable.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MURE, a framework combining text and visual reasoning for improved image editing, addressing issues in fine-grained spatial and object relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods struggle with complex object intersections and detailed spatial relationships due to a lack of explicit reasoning processes.

Method: MURE employs interleaved textual and visual reasoning (e.g., positional masks) combined with a Multimodal Deep Confidence paradigm which iteratively prunes low-quality reasoning paths for precision.

Result: MURE demonstrates significant improvements in image editing tasks using the new CoT-Edit-14K dataset and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MURE enhances fine-grained image editing by decomposing complex tasks into multimodal reasoning steps, ensuring higher precision and fidelity.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bootstrapping algorithm to handle geometric biases in fine-grained visual classification (FGVC), outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling geometric biases like orientations and scales in FGVC tasks is challenging, as real-world datasets rarely have aligned data, and current solutions (augmentation or equivariant architectures) have notable limitations.

Method: The authors propose a bootstrapping algorithm that progressively re-aligns training samples to reduce variance and recover alignment assumptions, with proven convergence guarantees.

Result: The bootstrapping method consistently outperforms equivariant architectures and canonicalization on four FGVC benchmarks, rivaling augmentation approaches in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed bootstrapping method is a promising alternative to handle geometric biases in FGVC tasks, offering robustness and high performance without the constraints of existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag integrates text instructions with object dragging for precise and flexible image editing, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models face trade-offs: text-based editing struggles with precise object placement, and object dragging is restricted to static relocation.

Method: InstructUDrag combines text instructions and object dragging via a diffusion-based framework. It splits the process into two branches: a moving-reconstruction branch for object relocation using gradient guidance, and a text-driven editing branch for semantic control, ensuring consistent transformations. Techniques like DDPM inversion inject prior information to maintain object structure.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates high-fidelity image editing, achieving accurate object relocation while providing fine-grained semantic control.

Conclusion: InstructUDrag effectively resolves key limitations of current image-editing methods, offering a versatile tool for flexible and precise text-based object manipulation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FineDual, a tri-stage method for modeling dynamic and hierarchical interactions in dual-human motion generation, surpassing prior methods in quality and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dual-human motion generation ignore dynamic changes in motion and hierarchical levels of interaction, leading to suboptimal modeling of real-world human interactions.

Method: The approach involves three stages: (1) Self-Learning Stage using a Large Language Model for individual-specific motion-text alignment; (2) Adaptive Adjustment Stage predicting interaction distances via a graph network at the inter-individual level; (3) Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage refining motion features using overall text guidance.

Result: FineDual achieves state-of-the-art results in generating dual-human motions, demonstrated by superior quantitative and qualitative evaluations on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The FineDual method successfully captures dynamic and hierarchical interactions, setting a new benchmark in dual-human motion generation and offering more realistic modeling of human interactions.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

*Chenying Liu,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-Label Classification (MLC) offers semantic understanding in Remote Sensing (RS), but is costly to label. Single-Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML) is scalable but suffers from supervision ambiguity. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC) framework, which uses pseudo-label generation and other methods to address SPML issues, achieving state-of-the-art results in RS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in Remote Sensing multi-label classification due to the high cost and complexity of annotating data. Single-Positive Multi-Label Learning presents a scalable alternative, but existing solutions in the RS domain are limited and face challenges like supervision ambiguity.

Method: The authors propose the Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC) framework which combines gradient calibration, Mixup augmentation, dual exponential moving average modules for pseudo-label generation, and an indicator to adaptively trigger gradient calibration to mitigate overfitting.

Result: AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance on Remote Sensing datasets under different types of label noise, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: AdaGC provides a scalable and robust solution for SPML problems in RS imagery, improving performance while mitigating issues associated with label noise, setting a new benchmark for the domain.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NTN-Diff, a frequency-aware diffusion model, to enhance text-guided image inpainting by separating and addressing different frequency bands during the denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in text-guided image inpainting, specifically in preserving unmasked regions and ensuring semantic consistency between masked and unmasked regions.

Method: The authors propose NTN-Diff, which disentangles mid-and-low frequency bands during the denoising process and divides it into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages. This approach ensures semantic consistency of inpainting while preserving the original image regions.

Result: Experiments show that NTN-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in text-guided image inpainting.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff successfully addresses longstanding issues in text-guided image inpainting by leveraging a frequency-aware approach to achieve superior results.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

### [242] [Learning Neural Exposure Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08279)
*Michael Niemeyer,Fabian Manhardt,Marie-Julie Rakotosaona,Michael Oechsle,Christina Tsalicoglou,Keisuke Tateno,Jonathan T. Barron,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Exposure Fields (NExF) to robustly reconstruct 3D scenes from real-world captures, handling challenges like exposure variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation in quality of 3D reconstructions and view synthesis caused by per-image exposure variations in real-world scenes.

Method: It proposes a novel neural field that predicts optimal exposure values per 3D point, enabling joint optimization of exposure and 3D scene representation with a neural conditioning mechanism.

Result: The method outperforms prior works, improving performance on benchmarks by over 55% while also being faster to train.

Conclusion: NExF effectively addresses high dynamic range challenges by eliminating the need for post-processing or multi-exposure captures, providing state-of-the-art results in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

### [243] [LTCA: Long-range Temporal Context Attention for Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08305)
*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new attention mechanism to improve Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) by effectively balancing locality and globality in temporal context extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVOS faces challenges in extracting long-range temporal context information to depict dynamic object attributes and in balancing locality and globality within computational constraints.

Method: The approach uses a Long-range Temporal Context Attention (LTCA) mechanism, combining sparse local attentions (dilated window attention and stacked layers for global view) with enhanced global attention via random key selection and global queries.

Result: The proposed method set new state-of-the-art benchmarks, showing significant improvements on MeViS valu (+11.3%) and val (+8.3%) datasets.

Conclusion: The LTCA mechanism effectively solves bottlenecks in RVOS by improving temporal context aggregation, achieving better performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

### [244] [Unlocking 3D Affordance Segmentation with 2D Semantic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08316)
*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method, CMAT, that transfers 2D vision foundation model semantics to 3D data for affordance segmentation, overcoming inherent 3D challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study wanted to bridge the gap in affordance segmentation by addressing limitations in leveraging intrinsic 3D data and transferring semantic knowledge from 2D Vision Foundation Models.

Method: The method proposed includes CMAT for pretraining to align 3D encoders with 2D semantics, optimize reconstruction and diversity, and a CAST model for generating precise multi-modal segmentation maps.

Result: The framework outperforms previous methods and establishes state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: By leveraging cross-modal semantics transfer, the paper successfully demonstrates improved accuracy and performance in 3D affordance segmentation.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo is a framework that speeds up video diffusion models by replacing some self-attention modules with linear attention while largely preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high quadratic computational cost of self-attention in video diffusion models, especially for long sequences.

Method: Proposed a data-free post-training framework with selective layer transformation using binary classification and an anytime distribution matching objective to effectively replace self-attention with linear attention.

Result: Achieved a 1.25-2.00x speedup while maintaining generation quality and a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal quality drop using a distilled model.

Conclusion: LinVideo enables efficient video generation by mitigating computational complexity while preserving output quality through intelligent layer selection and a novel objective.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

### [246] [Evaluating Small Vision-Language Models on Distance-Dependent Traffic Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08352)
*Nikos Theodoridis,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Ganesh Sistu,Fiachra Collins,Anthony Scanlan,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, DTPQA, to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) for traffic scene perception tasks with distance annotations. The study reveals significant performance gaps between smaller VLMs and humans (~60% vs. ~85% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of VLMs for safety-critical applications, like automated driving, where strong and reliable perception, especially at varying distances, is essential.

Method: The authors propose the DTPQA benchmark focused only on perception-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) in traffic scenes, with questions designed to exclude reasoning and emphasize perception. They evaluate smaller state-of-the-art VLMs due to hardware constraints in automated driving.

Result: The study finds that smaller VLMs significantly underperform humans on the DTPQA benchmark, achieving around 60% accuracy versus 85% for humans. It highlights challenges like distinguishing left from right and statistical limitations due to the small human sample size.

Conclusion: Reliable perception remains a challenging area for VLMs, especially in traffic-related safety-critical settings. The findings suggest room for improvement in smaller VLMs to handle fundamental perception tasks like those in automated driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a straightforward and efficient method for enhancing degraded images, including low-light and hazy conditions, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques.

Method: Construction of a custom image filter to simulate degradation and deriving reverse filters to reduce distortions during image enhancement.

Result: Experimental results indicate superior performance of the approach compared to existing techniques, especially for extremely dark and hazy images.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, competitive, and easy to implement, requiring minimal coding effort.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

*Mattia Ferrari,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a guided diffusion model-based data augmentation technique for hyperspectral satellite image classification, achieving superior accuracy and stable training compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance land-cover classification accuracy from hyperspectral satellite images while addressing the overfitting issue caused by small labeled datasets in deep learning.

Method: The paper employs a guided diffusion model for data augmentation, supported by a lightweight transformer network, a modified weighted loss function, and an optimized cosine variance scheduler.

Result: The proposed approach achieves better average and weighted average accuracy in forest classification over 10 types of forests using hyperspectral PRISMA satellite data, compared to other data augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: The method improves classification accuracy and stability during training, effectively overcoming common limitations of deep generative models in data augmentation.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVideo introduces a unified framework for multimodal video generation and editing, leveraging a dual-stream architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitation of unified multimodal models being confined to the image domain by extending their applicability to the video domain.

Method: UniVideo employs a dual-stream design comprising a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction comprehension and a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation, enabling accurate interpretation of multimodal instructions.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniVideo outperforms task-specific baselines in tasks such as text/image-to-video generation, in-context video editing, and task composition, demonstrating adaptability and generalization.

Conclusion: UniVideo establishes a unified paradigm for multimodal video generation and editing tasks, paving the way for future research with its open model and code release.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

TL;DR: This paper combines LayoutLMv3 and GPT-4 to improve the automatic extraction and matching of map legend symbols with descriptions, achieving superior accuracy compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in interpreting inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats of historical map legends, which hinder automatic extraction and usability.

Method: The method integrates LayoutLMv3 for layout detection and GPT-4 with in-context learning to detect and link legend items and descriptions via bounding box predictions. Structured JSON prompts are utilized for better performance.

Result: Experiments show that GPT-4 with structured JSON prompts achieves 88% F-1 and 85% IoU, outperforming baseline methods. It also highlights how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment influence results.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable and layout-aware parsing of map legends, facilitating better indexing and search functionality for historical maps across diverse visual styles.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

### [251] [Robust Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation based on Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08393)
*Ziqi Zhang,Yuexiang Li,Yawen Huang,Nanjun He,Tao Xu,Liwei Lin,Yefeng Zheng,Shaoxin Li,Feiyue Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a curriculum-based framework for source-free domain adaptation, aiming to progressively adapt models to new domains for tasks like medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Source-free domain adaptation addresses privacy and security concerns by enabling model adaptation without access to the source data. Current approaches largely neglect the learning procedure, motivating the need for a curriculum-based framework.

Method: The proposed method, Learning from Curriculum (LFC), combines two curricula: an easy-to-hard curriculum for gradual sample difficulty and a source-to-target curriculum to stabilize the adaptation process.

Result: Experiments on public datasets for fundus and polyp segmentation demonstrate that this framework outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The curriculum-based approach enables more effective knowledge transfer in source-free domain adaptation, showcasing its potential for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoVerse, a benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Video (T2V) models on temporal causality and world knowledge, highlighting shortcomings in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Text-to-Video models fail to differentiate advanced models, lack focus on temporal causality, and inadequately assess world knowledge, which are critical for developing world models.

Method: The authors collected diverse videos and crafted event-level descriptions with temporal causality, converting them into text-to-video prompts. They also developed binary evaluation questions across ten dimensions and utilized modern vision-language models for QA-based evaluation.

Result: VideoVerse features 300 prompts, 815 events, and 793 binary evaluation questions, offering a systematic evaluation for T2V generators. It provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: VideoVerse improves benchmark capabilities by emphasizing temporal causality and world knowledge, offering tools to advance T2V model development toward building accurate world models.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work scales continuous-time consistency distillation to large-scale image and video diffusion models, proposing a novel score-regularized approach that enhances visual quality and diversity, while significantly accelerating sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of continuous-time consistency models (sCM) in scaling to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks, particularly issues related to infrastructure challenges and benchmarking inadequacies.

Method: They developed a FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel for efficient training and introduced a score-regularized sCM (rCM) that combines score distillation to enhance visual quality and maintain diversity.

Result: The proposed rCM surpasses state-of-the-art methods like DMD2 in quality and diversity metrics. It accelerates diffusion sampling by 15× to 50×, enabling efficient and high-quality generation of images and videos.

Conclusion: The rCM framework is a practical and theoretically grounded approach for large-scale diffusion distillation, achieving superior visual quality, generation diversity, and sampling efficiency without extensive tuning.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive framework that simplifies image representation while preserving details and integrating advanced techniques for spatial image processing, thereby improving its applicability in real-time analysis.

Method: Multiple techniques were introduced: grayscale quantization for posterization, histogram equalization for color enhancement, HSV manipulation for brightness adjustment, convolution kernel-based sharpening, bidirectional pipelines combining unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification, and methods like Canny edge detection and Harris corner detection for geometric feature extraction.

Result: The framework achieved 76.10% and 74.80% accuracy in bidirectional transformation pipelines and 81.87% similarity in cue isolation. It performed robustly across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: This modular framework demonstrates strong deterministic performance, offering potential applications in real-time image analysis and computer vision.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

### [256] [The Visual Iconicity Challenge: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Sign Language Form-Meaning Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08482)
*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel benchmark, the Visual Iconicity Challenge, to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on their ability to process iconicity in sign language through video-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how vision-language models can understand and recover iconic linguistic structures from dynamic human motion, which are critical for visual grounding.

Method: The study proposes three evaluation tasks—phonological form prediction, transparency, and graded iconicity ratings—tested on 13 VLMs using Sign Language of the Netherlands in zero- and few-shot settings, and compared against human baselines.

Result: VLMs showed some capability in handshape and location detail prediction (phonological form) but lagged behind human baselines in transparency and iconicity ratings; models with stronger phonological predictions correlated better with human iconicity judgments.

Conclusion: The benchmark validates these tasks as diagnostics, highlighting a need for more human-centric and embodied learning approaches to improve the ability of models to capture iconicity and visual grounding.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

*Chong Mou,Qichao Sun,Yanze Wu,Pengze Zhang,Xinghui Li,Fulong Ye,Songtao Zhao,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents InstructX, a unified framework combining MLLMs and diffusion models for instruction-driven image and video editing. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and shows that video editing capabilities can emerge from image data without explicit supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in leveraging MLLMs for improving diffusion models' editing performance, particularly in challenging tasks like video editing. However, existing studies lack comprehensive design analyses and efficient integration methods between MLLMs and diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose a framework, InstructX, that integrates MLLMs and diffusion models for diverse editing tasks. They study unified image and video modeling, exploring how image-based training can lead to video capabilities and leveraging modality-specific features.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates that video editing capabilities can emerge from image data training, reducing reliance on scarce video training data. It effectively unifies image and video editing within a single model and achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks.

Conclusion: InstructX provides a robust framework for unified image and video editing tasks using MLLMs and diffusion models. The results highlight the potential of modality-specific features and emergent video editing abilities from image training to overcome data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoA-VR, a video restoration system that mimics human professional reasoning with three coordinated agents for identifying degradation, routing restoration strategies, and assessing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos face challenges such as noise, compression artifacts, and other distortions. Existing methods struggle with generalizability across diverse degradations, necessitating a model that can adaptively handle such complexities.

Method: The authors propose MoA-VR, featuring three coordinated agents: a degradation identifier using vision-language models, a self-adaptive router powered by large language models, and a video quality assessment model. They also present new benchmarks and datasets for degradation recognition and quality assessment.

Result: MoA-VR handles diverse and complex video degradations effectively and outperforms existing baseline methods in both objective and perceptual quality evaluations.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning is promising for general-purpose video restoration systems, as demonstrated by MoA-VR's superior performance.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how high-norm visual tokens (ViT attention sinks) from Vision Transformers contribute to reasoning in Large Vision Language Models, proposing methods to utilize these effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize the transfer of high-level semantic information from the Vision Transformer to the Large Language Model for better visual reasoning.

Method: The study identifies and analyzes ViT attention sinks, proposing both training-free and training-based approaches to leverage these high-norm tokens more effectively.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analyses show substantial improvements in visual reasoning tasks when explicitly utilizing ViT attention sinks.

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks encapsulate valuable semantic information and are under-utilized in LVLM architectures; leveraging them significantly improves reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

*Md Kowsher,Ali O. Polat,Ehsan Mohammady Ardehaly,Mehrdad Salehi,Zia Ghiasi,Prasanth Murali,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes "SliceFine," a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method based on only tuning specific slices of pre-trained networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for PEFT by studying why fine-tuning small sub-networks in large models is effective.

Method: The authors introduce and prove the "Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis"—showing pretrained models have universal slice properties like spectral balance and high task energy—and propose SliceFine, a method that fine-tunes weight slices without introducing new parameters.

Result: SliceFine achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art PEFT methods on language and vision tasks, while boosting training speed, memory efficiency, and compactness.

Conclusion: SliceFine validates the theoretical hypothesis through practical implementation, connecting theory with application, and offering a more efficient alternative to current PEFT techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

*Zhiyuan Zhang,Can Wang,Dongdong Chen,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexTraj is a framework for generating videos from images that allows precise trajectory control of motion points, enabling multiple creative applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the need for better controllability and efficiency in video generation frameworks, particularly for flexible trajectory control of motion points.

Method: FlexTraj employs a unified point-based motion representation and sequence-concatenation scheme for efficient training and inference. It also uses an annealing training strategy to reduce dependency on aligned supervision.

Result: FlexTraj achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, demonstrating robust performance under unaligned conditions and supporting diverse applications.

Conclusion: FlexTraj successfully enables alignment-agnostic, multi-granularity trajectory control in video generation, expanding its applicability across various creative and functional domains.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in spatial reasoning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing SpatialLadder, a model trained progressively using a new dataset, SpatialLadder-26k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving spatial reasoning in VLMs, which struggle despite recent advancements, due to insufficient focus on hierarchical perception and understanding.

Method: Development of SpatialLadder-26k dataset and implementation of a three-stage training framework, progressing from spatial perception to complex spatial reasoning.

Result: SpatialLadder achieves state-of-the-art results with 23.4% improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash, and shows strong generalization on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Progressive training from perception to reasoning is critical for achieving robust spatial intelligence in VLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

*Rishubh Parihar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,R. Venkatesh Babu,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kuan-Chieh Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Kontinuous Kontext,' a model for instruction-based image editing with adjustable edit strength, allowing users to finely control the extent of edits in a smooth and continuous way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing methods lack fine-grained control over the extent of edits, which limits their flexibility for users.

Method: The method involves extending a state-of-the-art image editing model to incorporate scalar edit strength inputs. A lightweight projector network maps these scalar inputs and corresponding instructions to the model's modulation space. Training is performed using a synthetic dataset of quadruplets (image, edit instruction, strength) created with generative models and subsequently filtered for quality and consistency.

Result: Kontinuous Kontext delivers a unified solution for fine-grained control over a wide range of editing types (e.g., stylization, attribute changes) without needing attribute-specific training.

Conclusion: The paper's model enhances the capabilities of instruction-driven image editing, providing users with a smooth and intuitive way to adjust edit intensities for diverse operations.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving long-chain reflective reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through new benchmarks, data synthesis, and training strategies, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in MLLMs' capacity for long-chain reflective reasoning, which is essential for solving complex real-world problems.

Method: The researchers developed a benchmark (MM-HELIX) and a large-scale dataset (MM-HELIX-100K) tailored for reflective reasoning tasks. They also proposed Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) for efficient training.

Result: Using the proposed methods and strategies, the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model achieved a +18.6% improvement on the MM-HELIX benchmark and a +5.7% average gain on general logic and mathematic tasks.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning can be learned and generalized in MLLMs using specialized benchmarks, data, and training strategies, potentially advancing their capabilities for complex tasks.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoNorms, a benchmark dataset for assessing VideoLLMs' cultural awareness using over 1000 (video clip, norm) pairs from US and Chinese cultures. A variety of open-weight VideoLLMs were evaluated using this dataset, revealing performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the need for assessing VideoLLMs' understanding of socio-cultural norms, as they are deployed globally with varying cultural challenges.

Method: The authors created a dataset called VideoNorms using a human-AI collaboration framework, involving theoretically-grounded prompting by an AI model and validation by trained human experts.

Result: The evaluation showed that VideoLLMs perform worse on norm violations than adherence, struggle more with Chinese cultural understanding, have difficulty with non-verbal cues, and fail to match human performance in formal contexts.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of culturally-grounded training for VideoLLMs and introduces VideoNorms as a foundational step toward addressing this gap.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARTDECO, a framework for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high accuracy but slow methods (like per-scene optimization) and fast but less robust methods (like feed-forward models) in 3D reconstruction.

Method: ARTDECO combines feed-forward foundation models with SLAM-based pipelines. It uses 3D foundation models for pose and point prediction, integrates Gaussian decoding, and employs a hierarchical Gaussian representation with LoD-aware rendering.

Result: ARTDECO achieves interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality nearing per-scene optimization across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARTDECO provides a practical solution for real-time and high-fidelity 3D digitization of environments, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

*Minghong Cai,Qiulin Wang,Zongli Ye,Wenze Liu,Quande Liu,Weicai Ye,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoCanvas, a framework for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion that allows user-specified patch generation across space and time, overcoming temporal ambiguity using novel conditioning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to unify various controllable video generation tasks like inpainting, interpolation, and extension into a cohesive framework that gives users flexible control over spatial and temporal video elements.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid conditioning strategy combining zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for temporal alignment to resolve temporal ambiguity in latent representations.

Result: VideoCanvas outperforms existing state-of-the-art conditioning paradigms in both fidelity and creativity, as validated on the newly developed VideoCanvasBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The novel approach establishes VideoCanvas as the leading framework for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion while broadening the possibilities for flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciVideoBench, a benchmark designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts, emphasizing challenges in multimodal AI's cognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating advanced multimodal cognitive skills using existing video benchmarks, particularly in the scientific domain.

Method: The authors developed SciVideoBench, a benchmark with 1,000 multiple-choice questions based on scientific experimental videos, covering 25 academic subjects and requiring domain knowledge, spatiotemporal perception, and logical reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art large multimodal models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL performed poorly on the benchmark, highlighting deficiencies in their video reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench is a significant contribution for evaluating and guiding the advancement of large multimodal models in complex video reasoning tasks within the scientific domain.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

### [269] [MultiCOIN: Multi-Modal COntrollable Video INbetweening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08561)
*Maham Tanveer,Yang Zhou,Simon Niklaus,Ali Mahdavi Amiri,Hao Zhang,Krishna Kumar Singh,Nanxuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a video inbetweening framework named \modelname{} featuring multi-modal controls for achieving precise and user-friendly video interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing video inbetweening methods, which struggle with large or intricate motions and lack fine control to align with user intent.

Method: The framework employs the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for video generation, maps motion controls to a sparse point-based representation, separates content and motion controls into two branches, and uses a stage-wise training strategy.

Result: Experiments show that the approach offers dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate video inbetweening outcomes through multi-modal controls.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances video inbetweening by providing flexible, precise, and user-intent-aligned controls, addressing prior limitations in this domain.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores end-to-end native training for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), introducing NaViL, a cost-effective MLLM with competitive performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of compositional training in existing MLLMs, such as separated training and difficulty in scaling, and to explore the design space and scaling properties of end-to-end native MLLMs.

Method: The study systematically evaluates design choices for end-to-end native MLLMs under data constraints, identifies an optimal meta-architecture, and investigates scaling relationships between visual encoders and LLMs. It introduces NaViL with a cost-effective training recipe.

Result: NaViL demonstrates competitive performance on 14 multimodal benchmarks, revealing a positive scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.

Conclusion: This work showcases the viability of end-to-end native training for MLLMs, offers a scalable and effective approach, and provides valuable insights for future research on native MLLMs.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

*Meixi Song,Xin Lin,Dizhe Zhang,Haodong Li,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents D$^2$GS, an improved approach to address the performance degradation of 3D Gaussian Splatting under sparse-view scenarios in novel view synthesis (NVS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inherent limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in handling sparse-view conditions, which include overfitting in areas near the camera and underfitting in distant regions.

Method: The proposed framework includes a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy to suppress overfitting by masking redundant Gaussians and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module to improve quality in distant regions. Additionally, a new evaluation metric was introduced for assessing stability.

Result: The proposed D$^2$GS method enhances visual quality and stability in sparse-view conditions, as confirmed by comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: D$^2$GS effectively addresses the challenges of 3DGS under sparse-view scenarios by balancing density and depth considerations while enhancing distant region reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

*Tajamul Ashraf,Umair Nawaz,Abdelrahman M. Shaker,Rao Anwer,Philip Torr,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-centric agent tuning framework for training vision language models (VLMs) to improve multimodal reasoning and decision-making with tools, relying on a large-scale dataset (M-TRACE) and preference-based tuning (Pref-X).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current vision language models (VLMs), which suffer from a lack of high-quality multimodal datasets and costly manual annotations that inhibit their effectiveness in complex reasoning and tool use.

Method: The authors propose an automatic pipeline that synthesizes multimodal trajectories to construct a dataset (M-TRACE), generates step-wise preference pairs (Pref-X), and fine-tunes a VLM-based controller (MATRIX Agent) using a combination of imitation learning and preference-based optimization.

Result: The MATRIX Agent, fine-tuned with M-TRACE and Pref-X, achieves superior performance on three benchmarks (Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA), consistently outperforming both open-source and closed-source VLMs in multimodal reasoning and tool-use tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances the capabilities of VLMs in multimodal tool use, and the authors provide a scalable solution with publicly available data and code for further research.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

*Haofei Xu,Daniel Barath,Andreas Geiger,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSplat introduces a recurrent model for Gaussian splatting that iteratively refines 3D rendering errors without needing explicit gradient computations, resulting in robust generalization and higher performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian splatting models are efficient but constrained by single forward inference passes. There’s a need to overcome these limitations for better performance and generalization.

Method: ReSplat employs a feed-forward recurrent architecture using rendering errors to iteratively update Gaussian distributions. It reduces computational costs by initializing the process with a compact model in a subsampled space.

Result: The proposed ReSplat model achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating improved rendering speeds and reduced Gaussian counts across various datasets, input views, and resolutions.

Conclusion: ReSplat successfully refines Gaussian-based 3D rendering with lower overhead and improved efficiency, setting a new benchmark in the domain.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

### [274] [Adaptive Execution Scheduler for DataDios SmartDiff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07811)
*Aryan Poduri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive scheduler for the SmartDiff engine, optimizing for latency and memory efficiency between in-memory and Dask-based modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance (p95 latency) and resource efficiency (CPU and memory) of execution tasks involving SmartDiff, a differencing engine.

Method: They use a lightweight preflight profiler, an online cost/memory model, and a hill-climb policy to adapt worker settings and execution modes dynamically.

Result: The scheduler achieved 23-40% p95 latency reduction compared to baselines and lowered peak memory by 16-32% in benchmarks, with no out-of-memory errors.

Conclusion: The adaptive scheduler efficiently optimizes latency and memory, balancing safety and performance, making it a significant improvement over static approaches.

Abstract: We present an adaptive scheduler for a single differencing engine (SmartDiff)
with two execution modes: (i) in-memory threads and (ii) Dask based
parallelism. The scheduler continuously tunes batch size and worker/thread
count within fixed CPU and memory budgets to minimize p95 latency. A
lightweight preflight profiler estimates bytes/row and I/O rate; an online
cost/memory model prunes unsafe actions; and a guarded hill-climb policy favors
lower latency with backpressure and straggler mitigation. Backend selection is
gated by a conservative working-set estimate so that in-memory execution is
chosen when safe, otherwise Dask is used. Across synthetic and public tabular
benchmarks, the scheduler reduces p95 latency by 23 to 28 percent versus a
tuned warm-up heuristic (and by 35 to 40 percent versus fixed grid baselines),
while lowering peak memory by 16 to 22 percent (25 to 32 percent vs. fixed)
with zero OOMs and comparable throughput.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Digital Twins (DTs) in the context of the
Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) call for seamless
integration with simulation platforms to support system design, validation, and
real-time operation. This paper introduces the concept, design, and
experimental evaluation of the DT Simulation Bridge - a software framework that
enables diverse interaction patterns between active DTs and simulation
environments. The framework supports both the DT development lifecycle and the
incorporation of simulations during active operation. Through bidirectional
data exchange, simulations can update DT models dynamically, while DTs provide
real-time feedback to adapt simulation parameters. We describe the
architectural design and core software components that ensure flexible
interoperability and scalable deployment. Experimental results show that the DT
Simulation Bridge enhances design agility, facilitates virtual commissioning,
and supports live behavioral analysis under realistic conditions, demonstrating
its effectiveness across a range of industrial scenarios.

### [276] [Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08180)
*Natalie Carl,Tobias Pfandzelter,David Bermbach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study suggests using a new hardware design for serverless computing, focusing on energy efficiency and replacing software isolation with hardware isolation via individual processors per function. This design significantly reduces energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current serverless platforms rely on traditional hardware optimized for singular workloads, leading to inefficiencies such as high energy costs due to overprovisioning and software isolation mechanisms. This highlights the need for reimagined hardware tailored to serverless computing.

Method: The approach involves designing a serverless-specific hardware architecture that allocates a unique processor for each function. This hardware is optimized for energy use, consuming resources only as applications perform work.

Result: Empirical evaluations indicate that the proposed hardware design reduces energy overhead by 90.63%, resulting in an average energy savings of 70.8MW for typical serverless workloads.

Conclusion: Shifting to a hardware-based isolation model for serverless computing offers a substantial reduction in energy costs and better alignment with serverless software requirements.

Abstract: Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with
rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of
resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only
consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless
computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency.
  However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or
thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server
hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree
of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared
caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are
optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated
functions.
  We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with
the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using
hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software
isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only
when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real
hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce
energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributed mechanism for resource allocation in cloud-edge environments, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and avoiding centralised bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and scalability issues in highly dynamic cloud-edge environments caused by centralised coordination.

Method: A consensus-based mechanism leveraging local knowledge and inter-agent collaboration to enable distributed and context-aware resource allocation without a central controller.

Result: The proposed mechanism ensures timely resource allocation, achieving speeds significantly faster (up to 30x) than centralised heuristics, while maintaining optimality and low costs.

Conclusion: The mechanism proves to be efficient and scalable for distributed orchestration in cloud-edge environments, overcoming the limitations of centralised approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed resource selection mechanism for diverse
cloud-edge environments, enabling dynamic and context-aware allocation of
resources to meet the demands of complex distributed applications. By
distributing the decision-making process, our approach ensures efficiency,
scalability, and resilience in highly dynamic cloud-edge environments where
centralised coordination becomes a bottleneck. The proposed mechanism aims to
function as a core component of a broader, distributed, and self-organising
orchestration system that facilitates the intelligent placement and adaptation
of applications in real-time. This work leverages a consensus-based mechanism
utilising local knowledge and inter-agent collaboration to achieve efficient
results without relying on a central controller, thus paving the way for
distributed orchestration. Our results indicate that computation time is the
key factor influencing allocation decisions. Our approach consistently delivers
rapid allocations without compromising optimality or incurring additional cost,
achieving timely results at scale where exhaustive search is infeasible and
centralised heuristics run up to 30 times slower.

*Dominick Banasik,Varsha Dani,Fabien Dufoulon,Aayush Gupta,Thomas P. Hayes,Gopal Pandurangan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper enhances energy-efficient algorithms for solving the maximal independent set (MIS) problem in the Radio Network model, aiming to improve energy consumption in wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the energy consumption issue in wireless networks, as nodes in these networks are battery-powered and energy is a critical resource.

Method: The authors develop randomized distributed MIS algorithms for Radio Network models in two variants: with collision detection (CD) and without collision detection (no-CD), optimizing energy complexity under both conditions.

Result: The proposed algorithm for the CD model has an energy complexity of $O(\log n)$ and for the no-CD model has an energy complexity of $O(\log^2n \cdot \log \log n)$, both improving upon previous results with guaranteed lower failure probabilities.

Conclusion: The paper successfully presents more energy-efficient solutions for the MIS problem, with demonstrated optimal or near-optimal energy complexities, contributing to battery life extension in wireless networks.

Abstract: The maximal independent set (MIS) is one of the most fundamental problems in
distributed computing, and it has been studied intensively for over four
decades. This paper focuses on the MIS problem in the Radio Network model, a
standard model widely used to model wireless networks, particularly ad hoc
wireless and sensor networks. Energy is a premium resource in these networks,
which are typically battery-powered. Hence, designing distributed algorithms
that use as little energy as possible is crucial. We use the well-established
energy model where a node can be sleeping or awake in a round, and only the
awake rounds (when it can send or listen) determine the energy complexity of
the algorithm, which we want to minimize.
  We present new, more energy-efficient MIS algorithms in radio networks with
arbitrary and unknown graph topology. We present algorithms for two popular
variants of the radio model -- with collision detection (CD) and without
collision detection (no-CD). Specifically, we obtain the following results:
  1. CD model: We present a randomized distributed MIS algorithm with energy
complexity $O(\log n)$, round complexity $O(\log^2 n)$, and failure probability
$1 / poly(n)$, where $n$ is the network size. We show that our energy
complexity is optimal by showing a matching $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound.
  2. no-CD model: In the more challenging no-CD model, we present a randomized
distributed MIS algorithm with energy complexity $O(\log^2n \log \log n)$,
round complexity $O(\log^3 n \log \Delta)$, and failure probability $1 /
poly(n)$. The energy complexity of our algorithm is significantly lower than
the round (and energy) complexity of $O(\log^3 n)$ of the best known
distributed MIS algorithm of Davies [PODC 2023] for arbitrary graph topology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of GPU acceleration into complex HPC frameworks like OpenFOAM presents challenges due to trade-offs in performance and development effort in existing methods.

Method: The authors developed a computational model and introduced a matrix repartitioning strategy that balances CPU matrix assembly with GPU-based linear solves for better performance.

Result: The study demonstrated that the proposed repartitioning approach mitigates oversubscription issues, leading to enhanced solver efficiency and optimized use of CPU-GPU resources.

Conclusion: The newly proposed method proves effective for improving the performance of OpenFOAM in heterogeneous environments, addressing limitations in current GPU acceleration approaches.

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) increasingly relies on GPUs, but
integrating GPU acceleration into complex scientific frameworks like OpenFOAM
remains a challenge. Existing approaches either fully refactor the codebase or
use plugin-based GPU solvers, each facing trade-offs between performance and
development effort. In this work, we address the limitations of plugin-based
GPU acceleration in OpenFOAM by proposing a repartitioning strategy that better
balances CPU matrix assembly and GPU-based linear solves. We present a detailed
computational model, describe a novel matrix repartitioning and update
procedure, and evaluate its performance on large-scale CFD simulations. Our
results show that the proposed method significantly mitigates oversubscription
issues, improving solver performance and resource utilization in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU environments.

*Nelaka K. A. R,Peiris M. K. V,Liyanage R. P. B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study identifies and maps nuanced behavioral and emotional patterns in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to create targeted educational strategies and technical aids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical lack of understanding and addressing the unique behavioral and emotional patterns in autistic children before they can develop learning and soft skills, particularly in the Information Technology domain.

Method: A longitudinal study is conducted to monitor emotions and behaviors over time, enabling a baseline understanding of students with ASD. Behavioral trends are then analyzed to propose targeted frameworks for applications and technical aids.

Result: The study identifies behavioral trends and proposes intervention frameworks that prioritize early identification of challenges to foster skill development.

Conclusion: A sequential, evidence-based approach focused on early behavioral pattern recognition can significantly enhance the learning environment and developmental outcomes of children with ASD.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

*Sixuan Wang,Jiao Yin,Jinli Cao,Mingjian Tang,Yong-Feng Ge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal graph neural architecture search method (MACC-MGNAS) to analyze and predict software vulnerability exploitation using genetic algorithms, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to mitigate risks associated with co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities by leveraging multimodal graph neural networks to improve accuracy in predicting attacks.

Method: The method employs a genetically-based multimodal architecture search approach. It uses a modality-aware cooperative co-evolution framework, dual-track surrogates for cost reduction, and a strategy to balance exploration and exploitation of architectures.

Result: The proposed MACC-MGNAS model achieves an F1-score of 81.67% on the VulCE dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 8.7% in F1-score while reducing computational cost by 27%.

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS demonstrates significant improvement in prediction accuracy and efficiency, proving its effectiveness in analyzing vulnerabilities data leveraging multiple modalities.

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiFair, a novel approach for tackling bias and fairness issues in multimodal medical classification through dynamic gradient modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in multimodal medical decision systems where learning may be biased towards specific data modalities or demographic groups, leading to unreliable and unfair outcomes.

Method: The proposed method, MultiFair, uses a dual-level gradient modulation process to dynamically adjust training gradients based on optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and demographic group levels.

Result: Extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that MultiFair outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both multimodal learning and fairness learning.

Conclusion: MultiFair successfully addresses bias and fairness challenges in multimodal medical classification, improving reliability and equity in medical decision systems.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates two crop yield forecasting models under realistic out-of-distribution conditions, emphasizing spatial-temporal alignment for robust generalization in agriculture affected by climate change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of increasing disruptions in agricultural systems caused by climate change, and to test the generalization capabilities of deep learning models in forecast crop yields effectively across varied regions and years.

Method: Benchmarking the GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT models using the CropNet dataset under leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation and year-ahead prediction protocols.

Result: GNN-RNN showed superior generalization ability across geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performed well in-domain but faltered under OOD conditions. GNN-RNN was also significantly faster in training compared to MMST-ViT.

Conclusion: Spatial-temporal alignment is more critical than model complexity for achieving robust generalization in crop yield forecasting, highlighting the importance of transparent evaluation protocols for real-world applications.

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

### [284] [DUA-D2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Aware Method for Overfitting Remediation in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15876)
*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Md Mohaiminul Islam,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DUA-D2C, a method to dynamically mitigate overfitting by using an uncertainty-aware aggregation of models trained on data subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in deep learning remains a problem influenced by noise, outliers, and insufficient data, motivating the need for more robust methods.

Method: The authors propose DUA-D2C, which uses dynamic weighting based on a validation set to aggregate subset models, considering both accuracy and uncertainty for improved generalization.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show improved generalization via better decision boundaries, loss metrics, and usability alongside other regularizations.

Conclusion: DUA-D2C is an effective, theoretically-supported strategy for addressing overfitting, complementing existing regularization techniques.

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

*Lingcheng Kong,Jiateng Wei,Hanzhang Shen,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of limited training data for GPU kernel generation by introducing a pipeline to create high-quality CUDA kernel datasets, developing the dataset "ConCuR" and the model "KernelCoder," which achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-quality kernel datasets are scarce and proprietary, limiting the use of supervised fine-tuning to improve LLMs for CUDA kernel generation.

Method: A pipeline is developed to generate and curate high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, resulting in the creation of the ConCuR dataset and the KernelCoder model, trained on PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel triplets.

Result: KernelCoder demonstrates significant improvements over current top-performing models, including QwQ-32B, other fine-tuned open-source models, and advanced frontier models like DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet in the KernelBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable data curation pipeline, insights into reasoning trace importance, and introduces KernelCoder as a leading model, contributing to advances in GPU kernel generation techniques and their associated metrics.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Encode-Think-Decode (ETD) method to enhance reasoning in language models by iterating over reasoning-relevant layers during training and inference, yielding significant gains on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efforts to improve reasoning capabilities in large language models focus on scaling parameters, data, or utilizing complex chains of thought, but these methods may be less targeted and interpretable.

Method: The ETD approach identifies reasoning-relevant layers in the model and trains it to iteratively utilize these layers. This strategy preserves the original architecture, parameters, hyperparameters, and training data while augmenting reasoning capabilities.

Result: The ETD method demonstrates notable improvements across 17 reasoning benchmarks, including a +28.4% accuracy increase on GSM8K and +36% on MATH benchmarks for the OLMo-2 1B Base model.

Conclusion: Recursive latent reasoning implemented through ETD provides a streamlined and effective way to significantly enhance reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

*Yunbo Li,Jiaping Gui,Zhihang Deng,Fanchao Meng,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedQS, a framework designed to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL), resolving trade-offs in gradient- and model-based aggregation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning's SAFL paradigm struggles with optimizing gradient and model-based aggregation, facing trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability.

Method: FedQS applies a divide-and-conquer strategy by categorizing clients into four types and adapting their local training based on data and computational resources.

Result: FedQS demonstrates higher accuracy, lower loss, and faster convergence compared to other state-of-the-art baselines across computer vision, NLP, and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: FedQS bridges aggregation disparities in SAFL, providing a unified and practical solution for efficient, stable, and accurate federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

*Nathan Boyer,Dorian Baudry,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for linear contextual bandits with paid observations, achieving optimal performance in both adversarial and stochastic regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge in linear contextual bandit problems of balancing exploration costs with achieving optimal regret, particularly in diverse settings (adversarial and stochastic).

Method: The method involves designing a Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm using the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework and Matrix Geometric Resampling for estimators.

Result: The algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret of Θ(T^(2/3)) in adversarial settings and guarantees poly-logarithmic regret in corrupted stochastic situations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends BOBW algorithms to complex linear contextual bandit problems, offering robust performance across different environmental settings by leveraging efficient computational techniques.

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

### [289] [Learning to Route LLMs from Bandit Feedback: One Policy, Many Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07429)
*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP introduces an adaptive routing system for selecting the optimal large language model (LLM) for each query, leveraging bandit-feedback and user preference mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently selecting the appropriate LLM for varying user queries while balancing cost and accuracy is challenging due to fluctuating model strengths, pricing, and diverse user needs.

Method: The paper proposes BaRP (Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences), a contextual bandit approach that trains using online feedback and enables trade-offs between performance and cost during inference without needing retraining.

Result: Experiments reveal that BaRP outperforms existing offline routing approaches by at least 12.46% and performs better than the largest LLM by at least 2.45%.

Conclusion: BaRP effectively bridges the offline-to-online feedback gap in LLM selection tasks, demonstrating robust generalization across unseen tasks while optimizing cost and performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard improves decentralized federated learning's (DFL) robustness against Byzantine attacks using compressed neighbor screening, significantly reducing computation and communication overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While decentralized federated learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative training, it faces challenges from expensive Byzantine attack defenses that rely on comparing high-dimensional model updates.

Method: The paper introduces SketchGuard, using Count Sketch to compress model updates into low-dimensional sketches for screening malicious neighbors before selectively fetching full models for aggregation.

Result: SketchGuard achieves up to 82% reduction in computation time and 50-70% less communication overhead while maintaining robustness against attacks on multiple datasets and configurations.

Conclusion: Sketch-based compression is an effective enabler of efficient and robust decentralized federated learning for large-scale web deployment.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

*Ankur Naskar,Gugan Thoppe,Utsav Negi,Vijay Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning method that achieves optimal convergence for reinforcement learning distributed among multiple agents without relying on unknown parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal difference learning methods for federated reinforcement learning require algorithmic dependence on unknown problem parameters to achieve optimal convergence rates.

Method: Proposes a parameter-free, two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning method with Polyak-Ruppert averaging for processing Markovian data.

Result: The method achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ in both average-reward and discounted settings, even under heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: FTD provides a scalable and parameter-free solution to federated reinforcement learning, addressing gaps in previous methods and offering robust performance for Markovian data in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'layered prefill,' a scheduling approach for large language model (LLM) inference to improve efficiency, latency, and energy usage, outperforming existing 'chunked prefill' methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient LLM inference in production settings, given strict performance requirements and resource constraints, motivated the study.

Method: The paper proposes 'layered prefill,' which schedules model computations based on transformer layer groups rather than tokens, reducing redundant weight loading and memory traffic.

Result: Layered prefill reduces time-to-first-token by up to 70%, end-to-end latency by 41%, and per-token energy consumption by up to 22%, compared to chunked prefill.

Conclusion: Layered prefill improves efficiency, energy use, and latency, offering a novel scheduling paradigm for high-performance LLM serving in shared environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents MoGU, a Mixture-of-Experts framework for regression tasks in time series forecasting that models output as Gaussian distributions and integrates an uncertainty-based gating mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mixture-of-Experts methods for forecasting provide only point estimates and lack an effective approach to quantify uncertainties and errors directly.

Method: Introduced MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution allowing mean and variance estimation. Replaced input-based gating with uncertainty-based gating that uses the experts’ estimated variance.

Result: MoGU outperformed single-expert models and traditional MoE setups in various time-series forecasting benchmarks and provided informative uncertainties correlating with prediction errors.

Conclusion: The novel uncertainty-based gating mechanism improves regression accuracy while better quantifying uncertainties, making predictions more reliable.

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

*Alex Kipnis,Marcel Binz,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based neural network, metabeta, for Bayesian mixed-effects regression that is faster than MCMC methods while achieving comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and intractability of Bayesian inference in mixed-effects regression when using traditional MCMC methods.

Method: The authors introduced metabeta, a neural posterior estimation approach leveraging transformers, trained on simulated datasets to amortize computation.

Result: Metabeta attained stable and comparable parameter estimation performance akin to MCMC methods but with considerably lower computational time.

Conclusion: The proposed neural posterior estimation technique provides an efficient alternative to costly Bayesian inference processes in mixed-effects regression, particularly for hierarchical data.

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using tensor completion to accelerate the design of lattice materials under biased data sampling scenarios, showing notable improvement over traditional machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing materials with specific properties despite the exponentially-growing search space and biases in experimental data sampling.

Method: The study utilizes tensor completion as a surrogate model for material design and compares its performance against Gaussian Process and XGBoost under different sampling conditions.

Result: Experiments revealed tensor completion outperforms traditional ML methods under biased sampling by approximately 5% in $R^2$ metric and remains competitive under uniform sampling.

Conclusion: Tensor completion is a robust method for material design, particularly effective when experimental data is biased, and performs comparably under uniform sampling conditions.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEMERA, an explainable AI-based framework using GWAS data to predict lung cancer risk with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve methods for assessing genetic risk of lung cancer given its strong mortality rates and potential genetic components beyond smoking.

Method: HEMERA employs a transformer-based deep learning framework that processes raw genotype data, including novel encodings, embeddings, and variant filtering, combined with post hoc explainability tools.

Result: The model was trained on 27,254 data samples and achieved an impressive >99% AUC score, effectively predicting lung cancer risk using SNPs.

Conclusion: HEMERA demonstrates the potential for transparent, genetic-data-driven models in personalized lung cancer risk prediction and supports early intervention strategies.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

*Yuanjun Dai,Keqiang He,An Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DYNAMIX is a reinforcement learning framework for optimizing batch size in distributed machine learning, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for batch size allocation struggle in heterogeneous and dynamic environments, necessitating an adaptive approach.

Method: DYNAMIX uses reinforcement learning (Proximal Policy Optimization) and a multi-dimensional state encompassing metrics and resource utilization without explicit system modeling.

Result: Achieved up to 6.3% increase in accuracy, 46% reduction in training time, scalability across a 32-node cluster, and effective policy transfer.

Conclusion: DYNAMIX optimizes batch size adaptively, enhancing training efficiency and generalizing across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

*Waleed Bin Qaim,Aleksandr Ometov,Claudia Campolo,Antonella Molinaro,Elena Simona Lohan,Jari Nurmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based framework for task offloading in wearables, aiming to optimize energy consumption and task execution time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable devices have limited battery and computational resources, yet they face increasing demands for processing-intensive applications in the IoWT paradigm.

Method: The authors propose modeling task offloading as a Markov Decision Process, leveraging Q-learning for decision-making without prior knowledge.

Result: Simulations demonstrate how parameter variations in the Q-learning approach impact task accomplishment time, energy consumption, and offloading percentages.

Conclusion: The framework improves task handling efficiency by balancing energy consumption and execution time in wearable devices through optimized task offloading.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

### [299] [Black-box Detection of LLM-generated Text Using Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07500)
*Shuangyi Chen,Ashish Khisti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurpMark is a detector for machine-generated text that uses token surprisals and a Generalized Jensen-Shannon gap to differentiate between human and machine-generated texts. It achieves effective results across varied datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a practical and effective way to detect machine-generated text under realistic conditions where the scoring model may mismatch the source model and individual contrastive generation is computationally expensive.

Method: The method involves summarizing the passage by quantizing its token surprisals, estimating a state-transition matrix, and scoring it with a Generalized Jensen-Shannon gap against fixed references built from human and machine-generated historical corpora.

Result: SurpMark consistently performs well across different datasets, mismatched source models, and scenarios. It matches or surpasses existing baselines and shows empirical validation of its statistical approach.

Conclusion: SurpMark is a reliable and efficient tool for detecting machine-generated text across varied conditions and datasets, outperforming baselines and validating its theoretical foundations.

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

*Shen Dong,Mingxuan Zhang,Pengfei He,Li Ma,Bhavani Thuraisingham,Hui Liu,Yue Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PEAR, a benchmark for evaluating the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and reveals key dynamics and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding vulnerabilities in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by providing a systematic benchmark and insights into their weaknesses and improvement strategies.

Method: The authors developed the PEAR benchmark designed to test planner-executor MAS through extensive experiments, studying performance under conditions of varying weaknesses and adversarial manipulations.

Result: The findings include: (1) a weak planner degrades clean task performance more than a weak executor, (2) a memory module is essential for planners but not for executors, (3) there is a trade-off between task performance and robustness, and (4) attacks targeting the planner are most effective at misleading the system.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable insights into improving MAS robustness and serves as a foundational tool for designing defenses in the face of adversarial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

*Tianyu Bell Pan,Damon L. Woodard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal co-training framework to improve model generalization, especially with limited labeled data and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for improving AI model generalization in scenarios with scarce labeled data and evolving environmental conditions.

Method: The framework utilizes unlabeled multimodal data, encourages agreement between modality-specific classifiers, and analyzes theoretical convergence and generalization bounds.

Result: The study provides theoretical insights into how these techniques enhance generalization and reduce classification errors through inter-view agreement and independence.

Conclusion: Multimodal co-training is effective for developing robust and data-efficient AI systems capable of generalizing in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

### [302] [MLLM4TS: Leveraging Vision and Multimodal Language Models for General Time-Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07513)
*Qinghua Liu,Sam Heshmati,Zheda Mai,Zubin Abraham,John Paparrizos,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLM4TS, a framework that combines multimodal large language models with visual representations for time-series analysis, achieving strong performance across various predictive and generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of analyzing complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in multivariate time-series data, and the limitation of current multimodal language models in processing continuous numerical data.

Method: MLLM4TS employs a vision branch where each time-series channel is visualized as color-coded line plots stacked into a composite image. A temporal-aware patch alignment strategy links visual patches to their corresponding time segments, fusing fine-grained numerical details with global visual information.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show MLLM4TS's effectiveness in predictive tasks like classification and generative tasks such as anomaly detection and forecasting.

Conclusion: Integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models offers a robust, generalizable approach to time-series analysis, bridging the gap between numerical data and multimodal models.

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

*Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Ghasem Farjamnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a wavelet transform-based method for automating sleep stage scoring, achieving high accuracy and reliability compared to conventional and recent deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate classification of sleep stages is essential for diagnosing and managing sleep disorders, but current methods rely heavily on manual work or basic EEG features, which can be limiting.

Method: The study uses continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to generate time-frequency maps that capture sleep-stage patterns, combined with ensemble learning, tested on the Sleep-EDF Expanded Database.

Result: The proposed method achieved 88.37% accuracy and 73.15 macro-averaged F1 score, surpassing conventional machine learning and performing well against deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Wavelet analysis offers a promising approach for automated, interpretable, and clinically relevant sleep stage classification, addressing limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

### [304] [Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536)
*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods for creating graphs that are fair and unbiased toward sensitive attributes, addressing both group and individual fairness while maintaining performance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph connections in real-world data often exhibit biases influenced by sensitive attributes, which can lead to unfair treatment in tasks relying on these graphs. This necessitates methods to evaluate and ensure fairness in graph structures.

Method: The authors propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an optimization-based approach with two variants: one focuses on direct bias constraint via commutative properties of graph stationarity, and another restricts bias indirectly through spectral properties.

Result: The proposed methods include fairness evaluation metrics, and experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of FairSpecTemp in generating fair graphs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp demonstrates that fairness in graph estimation can be achieved alongside high-performance accuracy, offering practical tools for addressing bias in graph-based applications.

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

*Qifan Chen,Zhongshu Xu,Jinjin Zhang,Dongbin Xiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to create targeted Digital Twins (tDTs) that efficiently predict long-term dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) by bypassing full Digital Twin simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce computational cost in simulating complex systems by modeling only essential dynamics (QoIs) using targeted Digital Twins instead of full-system simulations.

Method: The method involves memory-based flow map learning (FML) to build compact data-driven models of QoIs. It uses short trajectory data from full Digital Twin executions in an offline computational process.

Result: The approach was tested on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem, modeling hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder. The tDTs accurately predicted long-term dynamics without needing full flow field simulations.

Conclusion: Targeted Digital Twins are shown to be efficient and accurate alternatives for long-term predictions of system dynamics, achieving substantial computational savings.

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

*Lénaïc Chizat,Pierre Marion,Yerkin Yesbay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes dropout in large-width neural networks and uncovers five asymptotic phases based on dropout rate, learning rate, and width, offering new insights into dropout's behavior and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical role and dynamics of dropout in large-scale neural networks, especially in the context of its influences on optimization and training dynamics.

Method: The authors study the large-width asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with mean-field initialization. They employ theoretical tools from mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes to describe limiting behaviors and dynamics.

Result: They identify five distinct asymptotic phases depending on the dropout rate, learning rate, and width. They also find that dropout's 'penalty' effect disappears for practical learning rates, and dropout instead behaves as a 'random geometry' technique in certain settings. The results are backed by mathematical descriptions of dynamics in path- and distribution-space.

Conclusion: The findings challenge conventional views of dropout and provide a foundation for a deeper theoretical understanding of its role in large-scale neural networks' optimization and behavior.

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

TL;DR: The paper makes four theoretical advancements in improving PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for neural networks and achieves new generalization bounds on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the practical usability of PAC-Bayes bounds for neural network risk assessment.

Method: Introduces two new tight bounds on KL divergence, a method to optimize PAC-Bayes bounds as part of the loss function, and a technique for non-differentiable objectives.

Result: Achieved tighter bounds and the first meaningful generalization bounds for CIFAR-10 with neural networks.

Conclusion: The contributions provide both theoretical advancements and practical methodologies, significantly enhancing neural network risk assessments with empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

Method: Applied BERTopic with a robust preprocessing pipeline to analyze over 29 topics from a dataset of LLM conversational evaluations, paired with visualization tools.

Result: The study identified coherent topics and analyzed how model preferences aligned with these topics, identifying trends in LLM performance across thematic domains.

Conclusion: The insights gained can help guide domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for enhancing real-world LLM user satisfaction and application performance.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting effective machine learning pipelines for unsupervised tasks based on data distribution similarity.

Method: LOTUS employs Optimal Transport distances to evaluate similarity between datasets and recommends appropriate ML pipelines for unsupervised tasks.

Result: LOTUS demonstrated strong performance in experiments, outperforming notable baselines in outlier detection and clustering tasks.

Conclusion: LOTUS proves to be a promising approach for unified model selection across multiple unsupervised machine learning tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

*Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Ainkaran Santhirasekaram,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a method for identifying counterfactual outcomes for high-dimensional scenarios using continuous-time flows, addressing limitations in prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactuals need to be identifiable from observational data to ensure causal validity in studies involving multivariate outcomes.

Method: The paper uses continuous-time flows and tools from dynamic optimal transport to construct rank-preserving counterfactual transport maps, even in complex settings like non-Markovian systems.

Result: The method achieves consistent inference and shows improved counterfactual soundness in controlled experiments and real-world image data.

Conclusion: By establishing identification conditions and leveraging advanced tools, the paper provides a robust foundation for multivariate counterfactual inference, overcoming prior challenges.

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

### [312] [Symbolic-Diffusion: Deep Learning Based Symbolic Regression with D3PM Discrete Token Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07570)
*Ryan T. Tymkow,Benjamin D. Schnapp,Mojtaba Valipour,Ali Ghodshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Symbolic Diffusion, a novel diffusion-based model for symbolic regression, which generates mathematical expressions simultaneously rather than sequentially, showing promise compared to autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural-network based symbolic regression approaches rely on autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially and are limited by conditioning only on past tokens. The paper is motivated by the need to improve equation generation by overcoming these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a discrete state-space diffusion model (D3PM) that generates all tokens of a mathematical equation simultaneously using discrete token diffusion, thereby bypassing autoregressive constraints.

Result: Using a bivariate dataset, Symbolic Diffusion was compared to a SymbolicGPT-based autoregressive model with similar architectures. The proposed model demonstrated comparable and, in certain metrics, improved performance in generating closed-form equations.

Conclusion: Symbolic Diffusion offers a promising alternative to autoregressive models in neural-network based symbolic regression, encouraging further research into diffusion-based generation approaches.

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the learnability criteria in multiclass learning problems, especially for forgiving 0-1 loss functions.

Method: The authors create a new combinatorial dimension, Generalized Natarajan Dimension, to characterize learnability and analyze connections to learning with set-valued feedback.

Result: A hypothesis class is learnable with forgiving 0-1 loss functions in multiclass settings if and only if the Generalized Natarajan Dimension is finite.

Conclusion: The learnability of multiclass problems can be fully characterized using the Generalized Natarajan Dimension, linking it to set-valued feedback scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the
Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis
class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan
Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued
feedback. Through our results we show that the learnability of a set learning
problem is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension.

TL;DR: The paper compares liquid neural networks (LNNs) with traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants, focusing on accuracy, memory efficiency, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the potential of emerging LNNs in comparison to established RNN frameworks and identify their relative strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in sequential data processing.

Method: Systematic review of existing research on the principles, mathematical models, and challenges of LNNs and RNNs, contrasting their performance and characteristics.

Result: Finds that LNNs excel in handling noisy, non-stationary data and achieving out-of-distribution generalization, with some variants offering better parameter efficiency and speed than RNNs.

Conclusion: While LNNs show promise, particularly for evolving and complex datasets, RNNs remain a staple due to their ecosystem and proven applications; future work should focus on improving LNN scalability for broader use.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

### [315] [ClauseLens: Clause-Grounded, CVaR-Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Trustworthy Reinsurance Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08429)
*Stella C. Dong,James R. Finlay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClauseLens, a reinforcement learning framework for transparent and regulation-compliant reinsurance treaty pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinsurance treaty pricing practices are opaque and challenging to audit, which creates a need for transparent and regulation-aligned quoting systems.

Method: ClauseLens formulates the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process (RA-CMDP) and embeds legal clauses into observations to constrain actions and provide clause-grounded justifications.

Result: ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance (CVaR_0.10) by 27.9%, and achieves high accuracy (88.2%) in clause-grounded explanations with strong retrieval metrics.

Conclusion: Embedding legal context into decision-making and explanation pathways leads to interpretable and regulation-aligned quoting behavior, satisfying various regulatory standards like Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and EU AI Act.

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

### [316] [Expanding the Action Space of LLMs to Reason Beyond Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07581)
*Zhongqi Yue,Weishi Wang,Yundaichuan Zhan,Juncheng Li,Daniel Dahlmeier,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Expanded Action space (ExpA) for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve interactions with external environments. Introduces EARL Reinforcement Learning for robust and efficient task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of LLMs being constrained to vocabulary tokens for interacting with external environments, which overloads their reasoning and control tasks.

Method: Introduce ExpA, allowing LLMs to switch between reasoning in language and interacting with external environments via specific actions. Incorporate EARL Reinforcement Learning for exploring and optimizing this expanded action space.

Result: EARL demonstrates superior performance in tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning. Achieves perfect accuracy in Sort-4 problems and self-discovers efficient algorithms.

Conclusion: ExpA and EARL expand the capability of LLMs, enabling better reasoning and interaction with external environments, showing promising results in complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

*Hugh Blayney,Álvaro Arroyo,Xiaowen Dong,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the over-squashing problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), proposing a new architecture with enhanced storage and retrieval capacities for better performance on synthetic and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from over-squashing, where information from large receptive fields is compressed into fixed-size node vectors, limiting their effectiveness in representing complex information.

Method: Analyzing over-squashing through storage/retrieval capacity, proposing a new synthetic task, and adapting methods from sequence modeling to design an improved GNN architecture.

Result: The newly proposed GNN architecture shows strong performance on the synthetic capacity task and real-world graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work sheds light on over-squashing limitations in GNNs and presents a new architecture capable of handling information bottlenecks more effectively.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a library for machine learning on temporal graphs that unifies continuous and discrete-time methods, offering substantial speed improvements and new research capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal graph libraries are tailored to specific architectures, hindering support for diverse models, and there is limited comparability between continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic graph methods.

Method: TGM is a unified library providing first-class support for dynamic node features, time-granularity conversions, and handling various graph tasks. It ensures compatibility across different temporal graph paradigms and emphasizes efficiency.

Result: TGM demonstrates an average 7.8x speedup over DyGLib and a 175x speedup on graph discretization. It also enables new research possibilities like dynamic graph property prediction and time-driven training paradigms.

Conclusion: TGM addresses key limitations in temporal graph machine learning libraries, simultaneously advancing efficiency and expanding the scope of research in the domain.

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés,James D. Brooks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised deep learning method for broken rail detection using onboard sensors, focusing on robustness against challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliably detecting small and transient rail anomalies in indirect structural health monitoring, considering limitations in vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and labeled data.

Method: The study proposes a synthetic data benchmark and evaluates existing unsupervised models along with an Attention-Focused Transformer employing self-attention mechanisms for anomaly scoring.

Result: Transformer-based models excelled in performance, with challenges identified in handling high-frequency localized noise. The proposed model showed comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art solutions with improved inference speed.

Conclusion: The Attention-Focused Transformer is promising for onboard rail anomaly detection due to efficiency, but future work must focus on enhancing noise robustness for practical deployment.

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

### [320] [On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539)
*Joe Suk,Yaqi Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR, explaining its empirical success and deriving bounds for stable learning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a principled understanding of why RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), which uses binary feedback for post-training large language models, works effectively.

Method: The authors analyze RLVR's training process at two levels: full-response (trajectory) and token-level. They introduce a concept called the Gradient Gap, derive a step-size threshold for convergence versus collapse, and predict its scaling concerning response length and success rate.

Result: The theory suggests the critical step-size threshold explains the mechanism for stability and success rate limits. Practical heuristics like length normalization improve stability, validated through simulations and experiments including with Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: The findings explain RLVR’s effectiveness, detailing conditions for convergence and practical considerations like scaling rules, verified through empirical analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

### [321] [DGTEN: A Robust Deep Gaussian based Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Trust Evaluation with Uncertainty-Quantification Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07620)
*Muhammad Usman,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGTEN is a model for dynamic trust evaluation in large, evolving graphs, incorporating uncertainty-aware learning, temporal modeling, and anti-manipulation defenses. It shows notable accuracy gains on Bitcoin trust networks, especially under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for dynamic trust evaluation in rapidly changing graph environments, while maintaining accuracy, robustness, and resistance to adversarial manipulation.

Method: DGTEN uses Gaussian-based graph neural networks to propagate both semantic and uncertainty signals. It incorporates positional encoding, attention mechanisms, residual learning for dynamic shifts, and ensemble analysis to detect and mitigate adversarial behaviors.

Result: On Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN demonstrated significant performance improvements, including up to 16.41% MCC gain in cold-start scenarios and 11.63% MCC improvement under adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: DGTEN is an effective and robust framework for trust evaluation in dynamic graphs, capable of handling both smooth and abrupt trust shifts while resisting various adversarial tactics.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

### [322] [Improving Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08554)
*Kevin Rojas,Jiahe Lin,Kashif Rasul,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Molei Tao,Wei Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) and proposes Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), a novel RL algorithm that reduces variance in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) estimation and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty of applying RL fine-tuning to DLMs due to intractable likelihoods and the inefficiency or bias in existing approximation methods, such as those relying on token-level or sequence-level likelihood estimations.

Method: The authors introduce Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), which leverages Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to reduce the variance in ELBO estimations, offering a provably lower-variance estimator under constrained evaluation budgets.

Result: GDPO surpasses pretrained checkpoints and existing benchmarks like diffu-GRPO in tasks related to math, reasoning, and coding, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world use cases.

Conclusion: GDPO provides a more accurate and computationally efficient solution to RL fine-tuning for DLMs and sets a new standard for performance, thereby enabling broader adoption of diffusion language models in complex benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

*Chongyu Fan,Changsheng Wang,Yancheng Huang,Soumyadeep Pal,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes and improves machine unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) and introduces new evaluation metrics to better assess their effectiveness, utility retention, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the fragmented research landscape in LLM unlearning and the need for rigorous evaluation methods, particularly to address safety, privacy, and copyright concerns while maintaining model capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy for twelve stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three families—divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. They also introduce open question-answering (Open-QA) metrics to better measure generative performance.

Result: Their analysis reveals limitations in current evaluation practices like MCQ accuracy, which overstate success. They show the UE-UT tradeoff across methods and highlight nuanced vulnerabilities in robustness through in-domain and out-of-domain relearning scenarios.

Conclusion: Current unlearning evaluation methods are inadequate for fully capturing LLM performance. The introduced taxonomy and Open-QA metrics offer enhanced evaluation frameworks and guidance for future work in LLM unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

*Zichen Wang,Haoyang Hong,Chuanhao Li,Haoxuan Li,Zhiheng Zhang,Huazheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy in multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), introducing a Pareto frontier and a novel algorithm called EXP3-N-CS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on MABNI often overlooks the trade-off between minimizing regret and maintaining inference accuracy, especially for sub-optimal arms in adversarial scenarios.

Method: The paper establishes a theoretical Pareto frontier for the trade-off and develops an algorithm, EXP3-N-CS, paired with an anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequence to balance regret minimization and inference accuracy.

Result: The study characterizes the trade-off theoretically and demonstrates its practical balance through the proposed method in adversarial MABNI settings.

Conclusion: This work makes a significant contribution by addressing the overlooked trade-off in MABNI through novel theoretical and algorithmic advancements, providing guidance for balancing exploitation and exploration in such environments.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

*Md Hasibul Amin,Tamzid Tanvi Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel regularization method, Inter-Cluster Separation (ICS), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, significant obstacles in creating adaptive AI using deep learning.

Method: A regularization technique based on Inter-Cluster Separation (ICS) is included in the loss function, penalizing outputs deviating from previous task cluster centroids; coupled with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the weighting of the regularization term.

Result: Using the 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and ResNet-18 architecture, ICS demonstrated efficacy in maintaining performance on initial tasks but revealed its limitations for long-term retention as tasks increased.

Conclusion: ICS shows promise for reducing task overlap and mitigating forgetting but highlights challenges in long-term knowledge retention, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Value Flows," which uses flow-based models to estimate full return distributions and state uncertainties, showing a significant performance boost in RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods fail to fully exploit the structure of future return distributions, limiting their ability to make decisions under high return uncertainty.

Method: The method uses flow-based models to estimate future return distributions by introducing a flow-matching objective. It also derives a flow derivative ODE to quantify uncertainty and prioritize learning transitions accordingly.

Result: "Value Flows" outperforms prior methods in both offline and online RL settings, achieving a 1.3x improvement in success rates across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The use of flow-based models to estimate full return distributions and prioritize uncertain states provides a novel and effective approach for improving reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

*Changyeon Kim,Haeone Lee,Younggyo Seo,Kimin Lee,Yuke Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work proposes DEtached value learning with Action Sequence (DEAS), an offline RL method leveraging action sequences for effective long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline RL methods struggle with long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks and require improvements for practical application.

Method: Introduces DEAS, which incorporates action sequences to reduce planning horizon complexity via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, and mitigates value overestimation with detached value learning.

Result: DEAS outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on complex long-horizon tasks from OGBench and enhances Vision-Language-Action models, showing improved performance in simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: DEAS offers a promising offline RL framework that effectively handles long-horizon decision-making by leveraging action sequences, addressing critical limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

*Yuhan Sun,Zhiwei Huang,Wanqing Cui,Shaopan Xiong,Yazhi Guo,Meiguang Jin,Junfeng Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiveThinking, a framework to optimize AI responsiveness in e-commerce livestreaming by compressing large models into smaller, efficient ones with real-time latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In e-commerce livestreaming, large reasoning models struggle with high latency, limiting their utility in delivering real-time, engaging responses via digital avatars.

Method: The framework utilizes two techniques: distillation via Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) to create a smaller 30B Mixture-of-Experts model from a 670B one, and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to shorten reasoning paths while ensuring accuracy, helpfulness, and brevity.

Result: LiveThinking achieved a 30x reduction in computational cost with sub-second latency. In real-world tests on Taobao Live, it increased response correctness by 3.3%, helpfulness by 21.8%, and boosted Gross Merchandise Volume.

Conclusion: LiveThinking has demonstrated effectiveness in improving both user experience and commercial outcomes in live, interactive e-commerce settings by making AI responses faster and more practical.

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRFs++, an advanced method for graph kernel calculations, improving upon GRFs by using efficient walk-stitching and flexible termination techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limitations of traditional Graph Random Features (GRFs) in capturing complex relationships between distant graph nodes.

Method: Introduced a novel walk-stitching technique that combines short random walks to replace long ones, enabling efficient parallel computation, and used flexible termination strategies for walks based on general distributions instead of simple Bernoulli schemes.

Result: GRFs++ achieve superior approximation quality and computational efficiency in graph kernel computations, validated through empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: GRFs++ overcome the longstanding limitations of GRFs, providing both better performance and accuracy in graph-related calculations.

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

### [332] [GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07735)
*Rongchao Xu,Kunlin Cai,Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Zhiqing Hong,Yuan Tian,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoGen is a novel framework for creating synthetic location-based social network (LBSN) trajectory data to preserve privacy and maintain data integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing difficulties in collecting LBSN trajectory data due to privacy concerns and high costs. Synthetic data generation emerges as a promising solution.

Method: GeoGen employs a two-stage approach: The first stage uses a sparsity-aware diffusion model to reconstruct latent movement sequences, and the second stage uses Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture for fine-grained trajectory generation.

Result: GeoGen demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, achieving significant improvements in fidelity and utility on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GeoGen provides an effective solution for generating synthetic LBSN trajectory data, potentially facilitating applications like POI recommendation and privacy-preserving analyses.

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,Jiaang Li,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MeSH to enhance recursive transformers, resolving performance bottlenecks and achieving superior efficiency compared to non-recursive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive transformers face challenges in computational bottlenecks and information overload, hindering their performance compared to non-recursive models.

Method: The authors propose the MeSH scheme, which uses explicit memory buffers and lightweight routers to improve state management and computation diversity in recursive models.

Result: MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers outperform both recursive baselines and larger non-recursive models, showing improved downstream accuracy (+1.06%) with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MeSH is validated as an efficient and scalable solution for advancing recursive transformer architectures, addressing functional and computational inefficiencies.

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

*Noah Bergam,Szymon Snoeck,Nakul Verma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the reliability of t-SNE visualizations in representing input structure, showing its inability to infer input clustering strength and outlier extremity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the assumption that t-SNE reliably represents the structure of input data in visualizations, as this belief drives its widespread use.

Method: The authors theoretically prove limitations of t-SNE and empirically demonstrate failure modes in practical scenarios.

Result: They found that t-SNE does not reliably depict input clustering strength or extremity of outliers in the resulting visualizations.

Conclusion: Users should exercise caution when interpreting t-SNE visualizations, particularly for assessing clustering strength and outlier behavior.

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedBook, a federated graph foundation codebook optimizing domain-specific coherence and cross-domain diversity for the development of effective Federated Graph Foundation Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph foundation models often require centralized data access, which is impractical due to privacy and institutional constraints. The paper aims to address this challenge by developing methods suitable for federated learning.

Method: FedBook employs two phases: (1) Intra-domain Collaboration, improving coherence by refining local codebooks, and (2) Inter-domain Integration, weighting contributions to preserve cross-domain diversity.

Result: FedBook demonstrated superiority across 8 benchmarks, surpassing 21 baselines including various graph learning approaches.

Conclusion: FedBook successfully enhances federated graph foundation models' performance by establishing a unified codebook methodology addressing intra-domain and inter-domain challenges.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

*Qiaozhe Zhang,Jun Sun,Ruijie Zhang,Yingzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rényi sharpness, a novel sharpness measure for loss minima, to better correlate with generalization in neural networks, demonstrating stronger outcomes versus existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current sharpness measures exhibit weak or inconsistent correlation with neural network generalization, despite the intuition that flatter minima relate to better generalization.

Method: The authors propose Rényi sharpness, derived from the Rényi entropy of the loss Hessian, to measure the spread of Hessian eigenvalues and establish a strong link to generalization. They also develop Rényi Sharpness Aware Minimization (RSAM) as a training regularizer.

Result: Experiments show a strong Kendall rank correlation between Rényi sharpness and generalization. Additionally, RSAM outperforms other sharpness-reducing methods, achieving a test accuracy improvement of up to 2.5% over the SAM method.

Conclusion: Rényi sharpness effectively addresses the gap between sharpness measures and generalization. The RSAM training method proves its practical utility, surpassing existing approaches in improving generalization.

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VAMO, a novel approach to optimize multi-task learning in online advertising by aligning task weights with validation gradients and leveraging seasonal structures for improved bidding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online advertising optimization typically involves independent bidding tasks, leading to inefficiencies in computation and data usage. The authors aim to improve task performance while addressing limitations of conventional multi-task optimization methods in volatile environments.

Method: The proposed VAMO method uses validation gradients to adaptively assign task weights for optimization. It incorporates a periodicity-aware temporal module and a generative auto-bidding backbone to enhance seasonal cross-task transfers.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real-world advertising systems showcase the effectiveness of VAMO, achieving significant improvements in bidding performance compared to standard baselines.

Conclusion: VAMO effectively addresses limitations of multi-task optimization in online advertising by aligning task updates with deployment goals through validation gradients, ultimately delivering better generalization and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive modulation scheme for clients in wireless federated learning to reduce communication latency by optimizing modulation levels for different DNN layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless federated learning faces communication latency due to transmitting high-dimensional DNN parameters through bandwidth-limited channels.

Method: A layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme that assigns different modulation levels based on the importance of each DNN layer.

Result: The scheme reduces communication latency by up to 73.9% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Optimizing modulation levels per DNN layer offers an effective solution to mitigate communication latency in wireless federated learning systems.

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on modeling insect movement patterns, specifically lepidopteran larvae, using stochastic dynamics and equation learning from sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and forecasting of pest outbreaks for better pest management.

Method: The authors extend weak-form equation learning techniques and use the WSINDy algorithm with kernel density estimation on sparse datasets of insect position measurements.

Result: The study demonstrates the method's utility in modeling fall armyworm movement under simulated agricultural conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a promising tool to predict pest dispersal dynamics and enhance pest management strategies.

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in standardizing PK information from literature limits the practical applications of computational pharmacology models, necessitating novel methods for reliable data usage.

Method: Proposes HySim-LLM, which utilizes embedding-weighted fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to adapt LLMs for structured biomedical data, supported by two theoretical results.

Result: Formulated theoretical guarantees for adaptation performance and sample denoising, ensuring better handling of structured and noisy data in biomedical settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a reliable and interpretable adaptation approach for biomedical computational needs, paving the way for advancements in drug development and other scientific areas.

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach, SIMU, to improve machine unlearning in LLMs without compromising their overall capabilities, focusing updates on critical neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address issues with existing machine unlearning methods that compromise a Large Language Model's (LLMs) original capabilities while removing sensitive or unwanted information.

Method: The authors propose SIMU, a two-step framework utilizing second-order optimizer-based unlearning, which selectively updates neurons responsible for the sensitive forgetting set instead of altering the entire model.

Result: SIMU demonstrates comparable unlearning efficacy while outperforming previous methods in retaining the original knowledge and utility of the model.

Conclusion: Selective updates to critical neurons allow SIMU to ensure effective machine unlearning without degrading LLM capabilities, enhancing safety and utility.

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

TL;DR: MetaDefense is a framework that defends against finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in LLMs by leveraging embedding space detection and a two-stage defense approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses fail to handle disguised harmful queries created by unknown attack templates despite LLMs being capable of identifying them in their embedding space.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage defense process: (i) pre-generation detection of harmful queries, preventing interaction initiation, and (ii) mid-generation monitoring of responses to halt harmful content generation.

Result: MetaDefense shows superior robust defense performance across various LLMs while maintaining effectiveness in benign tasks, outperforming existing mechanisms.

Conclusion: MetaDefense presents a robust solution for detecting and mitigating harmful queries in LLMs, enhancing security against both known and novel jailbreak strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to

### [343] [Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07841)
*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language model fine-tuning often relies on large training datasets, which are inefficient and costly. This paper introduces a test-time self-improvement (TT-SI) algorithm that enables models to learn and adapt on-the-fly with fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model fine-tuning techniques are inefficient and expensive, relying on large datasets without guaranteeing improved generalization. The paper aims to address these limitations by proposing a more cost-effective and adaptable method.

Method: The approach involves three steps: identifying uncertain test samples, generating similar examples through self-data augmentation, and applying test-time fine-tuning for self-improvement. Two variants are studied: TT-SI (self-improvement using its own data) and TT-D (distilled supervision via stronger model-generated examples).

Result: Empirical evaluations show TT-SI achieves an average accuracy gain of +5.48%, outperforming standard methods while using significantly fewer training samples (68 times less).

Conclusion: The proposed TT-SI algorithm demonstrates the potential of self-improvement during test time, paving the way for more efficient and adaptive language models capable of self-evolution.

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

*Liting Li,Yumeng Wang,Yueheng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MA-GAD, a meta-learning-based framework to improve graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods for graph-level anomaly detection rely heavily on labeled data and struggle with noise interference, especially in few-shot detection.

Method: MA-GAD uses a graph compression module to reduce noise while retaining critical information, meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks, and a bias network to enhance anomaly distinction.

Result: Experimental results on four biochemical datasets show that MA-GAD surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both graph and subgraph anomaly detection under few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: MA-GAD demonstrates effectiveness in improving anomaly detection performance in real-world datasets by addressing issues with noise and limited labeling through innovative methods.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to enhance SEM images by estimating Noise Variances (NV) using machine learning models and utilizing NV-guided Wiener filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise contamination in Scanning Electron Microscopy images reduces their quality and affects subsequent analysis.

Method: The authors test five SNR estimation techniques, select Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) as the best method, and pair it with machine learning models (SVM and GPR) for NV estimation, culminating in the AO-GPRLLSR pipeline for guided filtering.

Result: The Optimizable GPR model paired with LSR accurately estimates NV, and the AO-GPRLLSR pipeline reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) after filtering.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively improves SEM image quality by robustly estimating SNR and NV and applying guided noise filtering.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

*Chongmyung Kwon,Yujin Kim,Seoeun Park,Yunji Lee,Charmgil Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMM, a novel drug recommendation framework utilizing quantum-chemical data (ELF maps) to improve prediction accuracy and reduce drug-drug interaction risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in clinical decision support by enhancing drug representation with molecular-level information.

Method: MMM combines three-dimensional quantum-chemical electron density maps (ELF) with a bipartite graph encoder to extract global electronic and local structural drug features.

Result: MMM outperforms baseline models in the MIMIC-III dataset, showing statistically significant improvements in prediction metrics like F1-score, Jaccard index, and DDI rate.

Conclusion: Integrating ELF-based 3D drug representations into machine learning frameworks can enhance prediction accuracy and support safer drug prescription in clinical settings.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

*Yongqi Ding,Lin Zuo,Mengmeng Jing,Kunshan Yang,Pei He,Tonglan Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes efficient self-distillation methods for spiking neural networks (SNNs) by exploiting the natural temporal properties of timesteps as submodels to boost performance and robustness without large teacher models or added training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance gaps in promising low-power spiking neural networks (SNNs) and eliminate reliance on large teacher models or additional training overhead seen in current knowledge distillation methods.

Method: They divide SNN timesteps into submodels and evaluate their confidence levels to identify strong and weak relationships. Two self-distillation schemes are proposed: 'Strong2Weak', where stronger timesteps guide weaker ones, and 'Weak2Strong', where the weaker timesteps distill knowledge back to stronger ones.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods improve SNN performance, enhance adversarial robustness, and leverage the temporal dynamics of SNNs efficiently.

Conclusion: The approach innovatively exploits temporal properties of SNNs, enabling efficient, high-performance training and boosting their discriminability and robustness without significant overhead.

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

*Alexander Rubinstein,Benjamin Raible,Martin Gubri,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO is a new evaluation method for machine learning models that selects samples based on model response diversity instead of complex clustering techniques, offering better performance prediction efficiency and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for ML models are expensive, slow down innovation, and negatively impact the environment, prompting the need for a simpler and efficient approach.

Method: DISCO selects samples with maximum model disagreements using greedy, sample-wise statistics instead of clustering, providing an information-theoretic optimal greedy selection rule.

Result: DISCO outperformed previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art results for performance prediction across benchmarks like MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, and ARC.

Conclusion: DISCO simplifies sample selection for model evaluation, improving inclusivity, efficiency, and environmental sustainability in machine learning research.

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

### [351] [PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964)
*Jiabei Cheng,Changxi Chi,Jingbo Zhou,Hongyi Xin,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESCRIBE is introduced to enhance gene perturbation prediction accuracy and reliability by jointly estimating model and data uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving predictions involving unseen gene perturbations in single-cell data, focusing on reliability under stochastic conditions.

Method: The proposed PRESCRIBE framework applies multivariate deep evidential regression to jointly measure epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in predictions.

Result: PRESCRIBE demonstrates strong correlation between its confidence scores and empirical accuracy, filtering unreliable predictions and achieving over 3% higher accuracy against baselines.

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE enhances prediction reliability and outperforms baselines, offering new capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction.

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using multi-agent reinforcement learning with a neural network-based climate surrogate to compute policies for multi-gas emission pathways efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges posed by computational inefficiency in climate policy models that involve multiple greenhouse gases.

Method: The paper introduces a surrogate model based on a recurrent neural network architecture pretrained on 20,000 emission pathways, integrating it into reinforcement learning environments.

Result: The surrogate achieves near-simulator accuracy with global temperature RMSE ≈ 0.0004K and enables policy training to be >100x faster.

Conclusion: The study bypasses computational bottlenecks while maintaining fidelity, making large-scale multi-agent climate policy experiments feasible.

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

*Qinglun Li,Yingqi Liu,Miao Zhang,Xiaochun Cao,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) improve the performance of decentralized training but cannot fully eliminate the performance gap with centralized training. This work uses stability analysis to understand why.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized training suffers from degraded performance compared to centralized training despite being communication-efficient and faster. Bridging this gap can enable better decentralized learning frameworks.

Method: The paper uses stability analysis to derive upper bounds on generalization and excess errors of MGS. It systematically studies how learning rates, data heterogeneity, node counts, sample sizes, and communication topology affect performance under non-convex settings.

Result: MGS exponentially reduces optimization error, thereby improving generalization bounds. However, a non-negligible generalization gap to centralized training persists, even as the number of gossip steps becomes very large.

Conclusion: While MGS can significantly narrow the performance gap between decentralized and centralized training, it cannot completely eliminate it. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings, offering a better understanding of MGS's potential and limitations.

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

*Kazuki Egashira,Robin Staab,Thibaud Gloaguen,Mark Vero,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can be maliciously exploited during the pruning process to demonstrate harmful behaviors post-deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the security implications of pruning techniques in LLMs, which have largely been overlooked despite their growing use for optimizing inference.

Method: The authors propose a technique where an adversary predicts the likelihood of parameters being pruned, injects malicious behaviors into parameters unlikely to be removed, and then repairs the model's initial behavior using likely-to-be-pruned parameters.

Result: Experimentation on five models showed alarmingly high success rates for malicious behaviors post-pruning, including jailbreak (95.7%), benign instruction refusal (98.7%), and targeted content injection (99.5%).

Conclusion: Current LLM pruning methods have significant security vulnerabilities, highlighting an urgent need for stricter security measures in model compression practices.

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

*Ruizhe Wang,Yucheng Ding,Xiao Liu,Yaoxiang Wang,Peng Cheng,Baining Guo,Zhengjun Zha,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reuse sunk computational costs in pretrained large language models by expanding their parameters and further training, achieving improved performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational costs of pretraining large language models by finding efficient ways to reuse existing pretrained checkpoints, which are currently underutilized.

Method: The proposed method involves expanding the parameter counts of pretrained checkpoints using orthogonal growth methods like interpositional layer copying for depth and expert duplication with noise for width. Scaling experiments were conducted to optimize timings.

Result: The study shows that reusing sunk computational costs significantly correlates to improved accuracy, leading to a 10.66% accuracy gain over training models from scratch under the same compute budget for models with up to 70B parameters and 1T tokens.

Conclusion: Recycling pretrained checkpoints offers an economically efficient method for improving large language model performance, demonstrating substantial benefits over traditional training from scratch approaches.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Motivation: To provide a faster and more efficient method for calculating Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors, which are computationally expensive in graph analysis applications.

Method: The framework uses nested evolving set processes combined with localized inexact proximal point iterations to approximate the PPR vector, with complexity limits based on the number of edges or precision required.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves an $
 \epsilon $-approximation of PPR with time complexity independent of graph size under certain conditions, outperforming existing approaches and solving a prior open conjecture.

Conclusion: The approach offers a computational breakthrough in PPR calculation, validated through experiments on real-world graphs, showcasing superior convergence efficiency during early iterations.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

### [358] [Unsupervised Radio Map Construction in Mixed LoS/NLoS Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08015)
*Zheng Xing,Junting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an HMM-based framework to reconstruct user trajectories and create radio maps for localization without needing costly location calibration, yielding high accuracy under indoor LOS and NLOS conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radio map construction techniques for wireless communications require expensive location-based CSI dataset calibration. The goal is to eliminate this costly process.

Method: The study uses a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to simultaneously model MIMO channel propagation and user trajectory. It employs Gaussian-Markov models for user movement and distinct modeling for LOS/NLOS conditions.

Result: Simulation experiments show an average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters indoors. The framework outperforms traditional supervised methods like KNN, SVM, and DNN in error reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully creates accurate and cost-efficient radio maps for MIMO networks, making it a viable alternative to traditional calibration-intensive approaches.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

*Stanisław Pawlak,Jan Dubiński,Daniel Marczak,Bartłomiej Twardowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses backdoor security threats in model merging by introducing the concepts of Backdoor Vector (BV) and Sparse Backdoor Vector (SBV), and proposes a novel defense mechanism called Injection BV Subtraction (IBVS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the security risks inherent in model merging, specifically the vulnerability to backdoor attacks that allow adversaries to manipulate model outputs during inference.

Method: The paper introduces the Backdoor Vector (BV) as a task vector representing the difference between weights of clean and backdoored models. It also develops Sparse BV (SBV) to enhance attack resilience by combining multiple attacks and Injection BV Subtraction (IBVS) as a lightweight defense mechanism.

Result: SBV demonstrates improved backdoor attack effectiveness that leverages merging, while IBVS offers an effective, assumption-free defense against backdoor threats, even without prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The study deepens understanding of backdoor vulnerabilities in model merging, contributes tools for both enhancing and mitigating backdoor attacks, and proposes methods that balance attack effectiveness and security defense.

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

### [360] [Do We Really Need Permutations? Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08023)
*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that simply widening models enables achieving linear mode connectivity (LMC) without special parameter permutations, contrary to prior beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge and expand the understanding of how model width influences linear mode connectivity, as prior studies relied on parameter permutation and increased model width.

Method: Empirical analysis of model behavior under widening without permutations, accompanied by layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity (LEWC) to explain intermediate behaviors.

Result: Widening models coupled with softmax temperature calibration alone achieves LMC, and the phenomenon was explained through LEWC.

Conclusion: Wider models enhance the possibility of achieving linear mode connectivity, even without parameter permutations, redefining assumptions from prior studies.

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

*Timon Klein,Piotr Minakowski,Sebastian Sager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed Subject-Conditioned Layer improves neural networks for EEG decoding by adapting to subject-specific variability, outperforming current models and advancing cross-subject foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of robust foundation models for EEG decoding is hindered by subject-specific distribution shifts, necessitating solutions to adapt models for such variability.

Method: The paper introduces the Subject-Conditioned Layer, which decomposes layer weights into shared, subject-invariant components and subject-specific low-rank corrections, enabling robust adaptation to individual subjects within any neural network architecture.

Result: Models integrated with the Subject-Conditioned Layer showed superior performance compared to subject-agnostic models and the average results of individually trained subject-specific models.

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer provides a scalable, effective approach for creating robust cross-subject models for EEG decoding.

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

*Daniel Jarne Ornia,Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how learning agents optimally utilize expert data in Bayesian multi-armed bandits, addressing offline and simultaneous learning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of complex learners alongside experts raises the need to understand how learners can optimally incorporate expert data, especially when it structurally differs from their own experiences.

Method: The authors formalize the impact of expert data on the learner's posterior beliefs, tighten regret bounds using mutual information, propose an information-directed rule for simultaneous learning, and develop strategies for assessing expert reliability.

Result: Pretraining on expert outcomes improves regret bounds, and a proposed rule efficiently chooses the data source maximizing information gain. Strategies to evaluate expert data safeguard learners from ineffective or compromised experts.

Conclusion: The framework introduces practical algorithms grounded in information theory, enabling agents to effectively decide when and how to learn from experts.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

### [363] [Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132)
*Kodai Kawamura,Yuta Goto,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Go Irie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU) as a method to reduce recognition accuracy for specific domains while maintaining performance for others in pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs retain irrelevant information for specific tasks, raising computational efficiency and information leakage concerns. There is increasing interest in selectively unlearning unnecessary knowledge while preserving model performance.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach for ADU that disentangles domain distributions and captures instance-specific domain information to address limitations in naive penalization methods.

Result: The proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to baseline VLM tuning techniques, effectively achieving domain-specific unlearning without sacrificing overall model accuracy.

Conclusion: This work advances fine-grained unlearning techniques in VLMs, demonstrating a practical solution to selective knowledge removal.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

### [364] [Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization: Entropy Is Controllable in Reinforcement Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08141)
*Chen Wang,Zhaochun Li,Jionghao Bai,Yuzhi Zhang,Shisheng Cui,Zhou Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) to address entropy collapse in reinforcement finetuning of large language models, stabilizing entropy and improving reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement finetuning methods for large language models, like GRPO, suffer from entropy collapse, limiting exploration and leading to premature policy convergence.

Method: AEPO replaces entropy bonuses with temperature-adjusted REINFORCE policy gradients, regulates entropy using temperature, and applies three core designs for better entropy control.

Result: Experimental results show AEPO stabilizes entropy, eliminates collapse in GRPO, clarifies the performance relationship with entropy, and generalizes the approach for broader optimization targets.

Conclusion: AEPO provides a robust framework for controlled entropy optimization in RFT, improving reasoning abilities of LLMs and extending applicability beyond entropy-based methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-based framework for large language models to enable early stopping during reasoning tasks, saving computational resources while retaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to improve token efficiency and computational cost reduction in large language models during reasoning tasks without compromising accuracy.

Method: The method involves using Shannon entropy from token-level log probabilities as a confidence signal to enable early stopping in reasoning tasks.

Result: The approach achieves 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task accuracy through entropy-based confidence mechanisms that are specific to advanced post-training optimized reasoning models.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models exhibit emergent confidence mechanisms allowing for early stopping, thus distinguishing them from pre-trained and instruction-tuned models in terms of efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

*Larissa Reichart,Cem Ata Baykara,Ali Burak Ünal,Mete Akgün,Harlin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable federated unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) framework, GALA, which enables stable training across diverse source domains without excessive computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in the number of heterogeneous domains in UMDA tasks makes existing methods inefficient or unstable, creating a need for a scalable and robust alternative.

Method: The authors propose GALA, which leverages (1) an inter-group discrepancy minimization objective for approximate pairwise domain alignment and (2) a centroid-based weighting strategy to dynamically prioritize relevant source domains for adaptation.

Result: GALA achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and works significantly better than previous methods in complex multi-source scenarios. The newly introduced Digit-18 benchmark also evaluates its performance effectively across diverse domains.

Conclusion: GALA provides a robust and efficient solution for federated UMDA tasks, specifically excelling in scenarios with a high number of heterogeneous domains, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

TL;DR: This study compares sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi for person identification using gait patterns. It found mmWave outperforms at low sampling rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether mmWave Wi-Fi signals, with their finer spatial resolution, provide a significant advantage over sub-6 GHz frequencies for person identification.

Method: The researchers collected a synchronized dataset of sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals in an indoor environment and applied identical training pipelines and deep learning models for comparison.

Result: mmWave Wi-Fi achieved 91.2% identification accuracy for 20 individuals, even at low 10 Hz sampling rates, when combined with background subtraction.

Conclusion: mmWave Wi-Fi demonstrates significant potential for accurate person identification, outperforming sub-6 GHz frequencies under certain conditions.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models to address limitations in biological sequence generation by leveraging bidirectional dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models lack bidirectional token dependencies needed for precise biological sequence generation, while NAR models, though holistic, face challenges in coherence and scalability. The motivation is to overcome these limitations.

Method: They designed a hybrid model with a shared encoder, two decoders (AR and NAR), and a cross-decoder attention module. The AR decoder integrates bidirectional features learned by the NAR decoder for enhanced sequence modeling.

Result: The proposed model outperformed both AR and NAR baselines in a nine-species benchmark for de novo peptide sequencing, delivering stable and superior results across varied datasets.

Conclusion: This approach innovatively combines AR stability with NAR's bidirectional context awareness, advancing sequence generation techniques in biological modeling.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

### [369] [Long-tailed Recognition with Model Rebalancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08177)
*Jiaan Luo,Feng Hong,Qiang Hu,Xiaofeng Cao,Feng Liu,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Model Rebalancing (MORE) to improve performance in long-tailed recognition tasks by directly rebalancing the model’s parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed recognition tasks are challenging due to skewed class distributions, which hinder generalization to underrepresented (tail) classes. Current methods struggle to achieve consistent improvements, particularly in broad multi-label settings.

Method: The proposed approach, Model Rebalancing (MORE), adds a low-rank parameter component and employs a tailored loss function and sinusoidal reweighting schedule to balance parameter space allocation. This is done without increasing model complexity or inference costs.

Result: Experiments on various benchmarks show that MORE significantly enhances generalization performance for tail classes and complements existing imbalance mitigation methods.

Conclusion: MORE is an effective, plug-and-play solution for improving performance in long-tailed recognition tasks and has broad applicability across multi-class and multi-label scenarios.

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deep learning caused by class imbalance and label noise by leveraging specialized auxiliary models and proposes the D-SINK framework for improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance and label noise co-occur in real-world datasets, leading to conflicting optimization strategies that degrade model performance.

Method: This paper proposes Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), leveraging separately 'weak' auxiliary models using optimal transport to align sample-level predictions and class distributions for enhanced robustness.

Result: D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong performance on benchmark datasets containing long-tailed noisy data.

Conclusion: The framework showcases the complementary strengths of specialized models addressing distinct challenges, offering an effective solution for handling complex data distributions and noise in deep learning.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Result: TabPFN consistently outperformed other models, demonstrating that incorporating environmental and temporal data improves prediction accuracy compared to speed-only baselines.

Conclusion: Data-driven approaches, especially those leveraging advanced models like TabPFN, are effective for onboard fuel prediction, aiding efficient and sustainable maritime operations.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

### [372] [Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218)
*Nicolas Espinosa-Dice,Kiante Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework, EVOR, which uses expressive policies and value functions, bypassing inefficient approaches like distillation and BPTT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for scalable offline RL methods for robotics that avoid the computational costs of online RL and overcome the limitations of current methods relying on BPTT or policy distillation.

Method: EVOR employs flow matching to learn a regularized Q-function during training and utilizes inference-time policy extraction through rejection sampling against the value function for efficient optimization.

Result: Empirical results show that EVOR outperforms existing baselines on various offline RL tasks, showcasing the advantages of expressive value learning.

Conclusion: EVOR offers a feasible path for scalable and efficient offline RL by integrating expressive models for value and policy learning, addressing scalability challenges in RL for complex datasets.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

### [373] [Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08219)
*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a method to improve Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance and robustness of CBMs, especially under interventions, while avoiding the need for extensive retraining of models.

Method: PSCBMs augment pre-trained CBMs with a multivariate normal distribution over concepts using a lightweight covariance-prediction module, eliminating the need for retraining the backbone model.

Result: PSCBMs improve concept and target accuracy during testing and outperform CBMs under interventions with efficiency.

Conclusion: PSCBMs provide an efficient and effective alternative to retraining CBMs, enhancing their performance and robustness by explicitly modeling concept dependencies.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

### [374] [Reinforcement Learning from Probabilistic Forecasts for Safe Decision-Making via Conditional Value-at-Risk Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08226)
*Michal Koren,Or Peretz,Tai Dinh,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP) for managing uncertainty in sequential decision-making under high-risk conditions, achieving notable improvements in forecasting accuracy and economic outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to tackle the challenge of sequential decision-making in volatile, high-stakes scenarios where uncertainty needs to be managed beyond merely maximizing expected returns.

Method: The authors propose the UAMDP framework, which integrates Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling reinforcement learning, and a planning mechanism constrained by conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). The agent operates in a closed loop, updating beliefs, sampling futures using Thompson sampling, and optimizing policies based on risk tolerances.

Result: The paper demonstrates UAMDP's effectiveness in equity trading and retail inventory control domains. It shows up to 25% reduction in RMSE and 32% in sMAPE for long-horizon forecasting. For economic performance, the trading Sharpe ratio increased from 1.54 to 1.74, while the maximum drawdown was halved.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that integrating Bayesian modeling, uncertainty-aligned exploration, and risk-aware policy optimization creates a robust and generalizable framework for safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

*Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Jaemoo Choi,Petr Molodyk,Bo Yuan,Molei Tao,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DMPO, a reinforcement learning approach aimed at improving Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) by matching their policy distribution to an optimal reward-driven one, leading to improved reasoning capabilities and significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) require reinforcement learning to match the performance of autoregressive LLMs in reasoning tasks. However, suitable RL methods for dLLMs have not yet been developed.

Method: The authors propose DMPO, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning technique using cross-entropy optimization to match dLLM policy distribution to an optimal reward-tilted distribution. They also introduce solutions for batch-size-related challenges through a weight baseline subtraction method.

Result: DMPO achieves significant accuracy improvements of up to 42.9% over state-of-the-art baselines and 55.8% over the base model on reasoning benchmarks, without supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively enhances reasoning capabilities in dLLMs, demonstrating the power of distribution matching frameworks in overcoming reinforcement learning limitations for these models.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

### [376] [The Hidden Bias: A Study on Explicit and Implicit Political Stereotypes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08236)
*Konrad Löhr,Shuzhou Yuan,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes political bias and stereotypes in eight large language models (LLMs) using the Political Compass Test (PCT), finding a consistent left-leaning political bias and complex interplay of explicit and implicit stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the societal influence of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs, especially due to their impact on public opinion and democratic processes.

Method: The Political Compass Test (PCT) was applied to assess political leanings, identify explicit stereotypes through persona prompting, and uncover implicit stereotypes using multilingual versions of the PCT.

Result: All eight LLMs exhibited left-leaning political biases. Implicit stereotypes were more pronounced than explicit ones, though both showed notable alignment in many models.

Conclusion: The study highlights that LLMs display consistent political bias and varying stereotypes, emphasizing the need to address these biases for fairer AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

### [377] [Opponent Shaping in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08255)
*Marta Emili Garcia Segura,Stephen Hailes,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Large Language Model (LLM) agents can influence the learning dynamics of co-players in multi-agent interactions through opponent shaping (OS) strategies, introducing a novel method called ShapeLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LLM agents can engage in strategic behavior to influence other agents' learning dynamics in multi-agent environments, a growing area of importance with the rise of autonomous LLM-based agents.

Method: The researchers propose ShapeLLM, a model-free adaptation of opponent shaping methods tailored specifically for transformer-based LLM agents, and test it in various game-theoretic environments, including both competitive and cooperative games.

Result: ShapeLLM enables LLM agents to shape opponents' learning dynamics successfully. In competitive games like Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Matching Pennies, agents guide co-players toward exploitable equilibria, while in cooperative games like Iterated Stag Hunt, they improve collective welfare.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents can engage in opponent shaping, both influencing and being influenced through interaction. This establishes a new research focus on opponent shaping as essential for advancing multi-agent systems using LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Jason Bohne,Pawel Polak,David Rosenberg,Brian Bloniarz,Gary Kazantsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mix- and MoE-DPO, which enhances Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by integrating mixture models and mixture-of-experts architectures to improve large language models' alignment with diverse user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO frameworks face limitations in multi-task environments and diverse preference distributions due to their reliance on a single model architecture.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts using stochastic variational inference to optimize a latent-variable model and variational evidence lower bound (ELBO).

Result: The method delivers better generalization, reward and policy specialization, and contextual alignment for large language models (LLMs) across various model sizes and datasets.

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO outperforms standard DPO by leveraging specialized expert policies, input-specific gating, and flexible architectures for scalable and user-aligned preference learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

*Tsuyoshi Okita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical framework for time-series generation that incorporates physical constraints using advanced neural network techniques, improving both generation quality and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in conventional time-series generation methods that often fail to respect domain-specific physical constraints, leading to inconsistencies.

Method: The proposed method uses a hierarchical framework that integrates Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) under time-dependent physical constraints, ensuring physical laws are respected.

Result: The experiments demonstrated a 16.3% improvement in generation quality, a 46% reduction in physics violations, and an 18.5% increase in predictive accuracy as compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical physical laws in generative models results in statistically and physically consistent time-series generation, setting a new standard for physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) for dynamic feature adaptation in 6G networks and proposes a Drift-Aware Feature Importance (DAFI) approach for efficient explainability in AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible AI models are required to adapt to dynamic, non-stationary 6G network conditions due to multi-vendor deployments, hardware updates, and evolving service needs.

Method: The paper utilizes Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) for iterative training to improve prediction accuracy over time and introduces DAFI, a feature importance method using drift detection to optimize computational efficiency.

Result: Tests on three datasets show reduced runtime by up to 2x while improving consistency in feature importance values.

Conclusion: ARFs and DAFI offer a robust framework for adaptive and explainable AI solutions tailored to complex 6G network environments.

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

*Abdellah El Mrini,Sadegh Farhadkhan,Rachid Guerraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPEL is a new collaborative machine learning method that uses an efficient pull-based communication strategy to ensure robust learning despite adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training-time adversarial behaviors in collaborative machine learning while avoiding high communication costs and reliance on central servers.

Method: RPEL introduces a pull-based epidemic-inspired communication strategy, where model parameters are pulled randomly from a subset of nodes, reducing communication costs to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ while ensuring robust convergence.

Result: RPEL demonstrates robust learning in adversarial settings, achieving accuracies equivalent to all-to-all communication schemes and efficiently scaling across large networks.

Conclusion: RPEL offers a scalable, decentralized, and robust solution for collaborative machine learning under adversarial conditions, with significant reductions in communication costs.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the 'Learning to Ask' (LtA) framework, enhancing human-AI collaboration by utilizing expert feedback dynamically, as opposed to traditional methods that treat humans and ML models as separate decision-makers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve decision-support systems by addressing the limitation of traditional Learning to Defer (LtD) methods, which restrict human contributions to predictions and fail to harness human-AI synergies efficiently.

Method: LtA introduces a two-part architecture: (1) a standard ML model and (2) an enriched model trained with expert human feedback. It optimally decides when to query the enriched model. Two implementations are proposed: sequential and joint training, with surrogate losses ensuring consistency for the latter.

Result: The LtA framework demonstrated improved flexibility and effectiveness in human-AI collaboration through experiments with both synthetic and real expert data.

Conclusion: The introduction of LtA provides a more integrative approach to human-AI collaboration, surpassing traditional models like LtD in leveraging expert input dynamically and effectively.

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates length generalization in transformers through the set complement task, presenting theoretical and practical insights into mechanisms and their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and improve how transformers generalize to longer input sequences, a key challenge in tasks resembling board-game reasoning.

Method: The authors provide theoretical bounds, analyze mechanistic softmax limitations, and test dropout and EMA as interventions in training to address these challenges. Empirical validations include random hyperparameter search and testing on OthelloGPT.

Result: The research confirms that dropout mitigates softmax-related logit displacement issues and EMA addresses training noise. Both approaches enhance length generalization in transformer models.

Conclusion: Transformers can generalize their reasoning abilities over longer inputs by counteracting specific mechanistic and training dynamics obstacles using techniques like dropout and EMA.

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning framework, optimizes personalized enteral nutrition for ICU patients, showing significant improvements in mortality reduction and nutritional biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critically ill patients often require personalized nutrition plans to improve survival and recovery, yet traditional approaches may lack precision and adaptability.

Method: DeepEN uses data-driven deep reinforcement learning with a curated state space, custom reward functions, and advanced Q-network techniques to create tailored nutritional recommendations every 4 hours.

Result: DeepEN reduced estimated mortality by 3.7 percentage points (18.8% vs 22.5%) and improved nutritional biomarkers compared to clinician-derived and guideline-based policies.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a data-driven RL approach to achieve safe, personalized enteral nutrition therapy, outperforming traditional methods in ICU settings.

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained masked diffusion models struggle with irreversible decisions during sampling and perform poorly in scenarios with low sampling steps.

Method: The paper proposes a star-shaped reformulation of sampling, augmented by a learnable re-masking scheduler, to revise likely errors effectively after fine-tuning a single layer.

Result: The proposed method shows significant quality improvements, especially in low-step regimes, and demonstrates superior or comparable performance in text and code generation tasks.

Conclusion: The novel sampling algorithm enhances the usability and efficiency of diffusion models in diverse applications through error correction and optimized scheduling.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of using contrastive learning frameworks on edge and fog devices where computational resources, energy, and data availability are limited.

Method: The authors systematically benchmarked four key CL frameworks—SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow Twins—by incorporating energy profiling and testing under reduced training data conditions.

Result: SimCLR emerged as the most energy-efficient framework among the evaluated methods, challenging its reputation for being computationally expensive.

Conclusion: The study sheds light on the resource implications of deploying contrastive learning on constrained devices and identifies optimization paths for future research.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

### [387] [FlyLoRA: Boosting Task Decoupling and Parameter Efficiency via Implicit Rank-Wise Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08396)
*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Yao Zhu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA is a biologically inspired variant of LoRA that reduces parameter interference and improves multi-task performance by using a novel implicit Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA methods struggle with parameter interference, limiting their effectiveness in both single-task and multi-task tuning. Traditional MoE-based approaches require additional parameters and fail to address inter-task interference.

Method: FlyLoRA applies rank-wise expert activation and replaces the dense trainable down-projection matrix with a frozen sparse random projection. This eliminates the need for explicit routers and leverages the orthogonality properties of random matrices.

Result: FlyLoRA achieved consistent performance improvements across general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks, outperforming existing fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: FlyLoRA demonstrates how biologically inspired designs can overcome parameter interference in fine-tuning, achieving computational efficiency and effective multi-task model alignment.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

*Lauren Anderson,Lucas Chatelain,Nicolas Tremblay,Kathryn Grandfield,David Rousseau,Aurélien Gourrier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates the use of deep learning super-resolution models to enhance confocal fluorescence microscopy images of tooth dentin porosity networks, achieving better image quality for biological interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations posed by confocal fluorescence microscopy's small field of view in capturing sub-microscopic porosity vessels in tooth dentin for better mechanosensory system analysis.

Method: Four deep learning models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN, CycleGAN) were tested on paired high- and low-resolution confocal images. Their image quality was analyzed using conventional metrics, custom segmentation, and graph analysis to evaluate 3D porosity connectivity.

Result: Conventional image quality metrics yielded inconsistent results compared to visual observations. Custom biological assessments revealed differences in model sensitivity and performance, particularly in preserving weak intensity features and 3D connectivity.

Conclusion: Biology-driven evaluation methods provided more relevant insights than standard IQA metrics, improving mechanistic interpretation of SR model performance, especially for analyzing dental porosity networks.

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

*David Madras,Joshua Safyan,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why prompt engineering techniques perform well even in data-scarce situations. It introduces perplexity as a key factor and develops theoretical bounds and empirical evaluations to validate its role in guiding prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the widespread success of prompt engineering, particularly in scenarios with limited task-specific data, and improve theoretical understanding by considering perplexity as an effective prior.

Method: The authors derive novel PAC-Bayes-based generalization bounds that incorporate distribution-dependent perplexity. These bounds account for tighter regularization and limit exploration in prompt optimization. Empirical evaluations are conducted to assess these theories and the practical usability of perplexity regularization.

Result: The derived generalization bounds are shown to be effective, even in data-scarce scenarios. Empirical results reveal that perplexity regularization improves prompt generalization and enhances optimization outcomes.

Conclusion: Considering perplexity as an effective prior explains the success of prompt engineering techniques. Perplexity regularization leads to tighter theoretical bounds and practical enhancements, especially in data-limited environments.

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

### [390] [Reinforcing Diffusion Models by Direct Group Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08425)
*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DGPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm eliminating the need for stochastic policies, enabling faster training with deterministic samplers in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning methods like GRPO have challenged adaptation to diffusion models due to reliance on stochastic policies and inefficient samplers, motivating the need for a streamlined approach.

Method: The authors propose DGPO, an RL algorithm using group-level preferences for training, bypassing stochastic policies and leveraging deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency.

Result: DGPO achieves approximately 20x faster training than prior methods and delivers better performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics.

Conclusion: DGPO significantly improves the speed and performance of RL training in diffusion models, resolving inefficiencies tied to stochastic samplers.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces xRouter, a cost-aware routing system for LLMs that uses reinforcement learning to achieve strong cost-performance trade-offs by balancing task complexity and resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in existing LLM routing strategies that either rely on static rules or result in an underutilization of the cost-performance spectrum of various LLMs.

Method: xRouter uses a learned router trained end-to-end through reinforcement learning with cost-aware rewards to make dynamic decisions between answering tasks or invoking external models.

Result: xRouter demonstrates improved cost-performance trade-offs across benchmarks, achieving significant cost reductions while maintaining comparable task success rates. It also sheds light on factors that influence learned routing effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study concludes that xRouter is an effective approach for cost-aware LLM orchestration, offering practical insights and an open implementation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

TL;DR: This paper presents SymTime, a foundation model using series-symbol data pairs for time series analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like data scarcity and imbalance hinder the development of foundation models for time series analysis.

Method: A series-symbol data generation mechanism is introduced, paired with a pre-trained foundation model leveraging symbolic correlations to enhance time series representation.

Result: SymTime delivers competitive performance across five major time series analysis tasks when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the viability of series-symbol data creation and pretraining methods to address data limitations and improve task outcomes.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

*Ankur Mali,Lawrence Hall,Jake Williams,Gordon Richards*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rigorous nine-dimensional framework for classifying neural network activation functions based on their propagation statistics, slopes, and regularity measures, providing insights into their stability and expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond heuristic-based activation function comparisons and establish a systematic and provable framework for evaluating them.

Method: The authors construct a nine-dimensional integral signature framework combining Gaussian propagation statistics, asymptotic slopes, and regularity measures for classifying and analyzing activation functions.

Result: The framework classifies eight standard activation functions into distinct categories (saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families), offering Lyapunov stability analysis, variance stability insights, and kernel perspective connections.

Conclusion: This framework shifts activation function selection from empirical trial-and-error to a provable, principled design, aiding neural network stability and kernel conditioning.

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

*Kwanseok Kim,Jaehoon Hahm,Sumin Kim,Jinhwan Sul,Byunghak Kim,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SummDiff, a model utilizing diffusion techniques to frame video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing for diverse and subjective summaries that align with individual preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches in video summarization ignored subjectivity and focused on deterministic frame scoring, overlooking the human variability in what constitutes a meaningful video summary.

Method: The paper frames video summarization as a conditional generation problem and adopts diffusion models to generate diverse summaries by learning the distribution of good summaries, conditioned on the input video.

Result: SummDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and generates summaries that closely align with differing annotator preferences.

Conclusion: SummDiff effectively addresses inherent subjectivity in video summarization and provides an advanced method to dynamically adapt to diverse contexts, improving both summary quality and alignment with user perspectives.

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods are limited by predefined similarity measures, lacking flexibility in capturing complex input relationships.

Method: The authors present ICC, which utilizes LLMs for clustering via attention matrices and fine-tuning with Next Token Prediction (NTP) loss. They also integrate text-conditioned image clustering.

Result: Pretrained LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot clustering abilities, with spectral clustering on attention matrices yielding competitive results. Fine-tuning enhances performance further.

Conclusion: ICC extends LLMs to unsupervised learning, highlighting their effectiveness and flexibility in diverse clustering tasks. The approach outperforms classical clustering methods in some areas.

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

*Sharut Gupta,Shobhita Sundaram,Chenyu Wang,Stefanie Jegelka,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UML, a training approach leveraging unpaired multimodal data for representation learning across modalities, boosting unimodal task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address dependency on paired multimodal datasets and explore how unpaired multimodal data can enhance representation learning in a target modality.

Method: A modality-agnostic paradigm where a single model alternately processes unpaired multimodal inputs, sharing parameters to capture their shared underlying structure.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate improved performance on unimodal tasks using unpaired auxiliary modalities such as text, audio, and images.

Conclusion: Unpaired multimodal data enables better representation learning, proving valuable for improving unimodal task outcomes in diverse settings.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

*Yash Jhaveri,Harley Wiltzer,Patrick Shafto,Marc G. Bellemare,David Meger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method in reinforcement learning to ensure convergence to a specific type of optimal policy using entropy regularization and temperature decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL often focuses only on maximizing expected returns, ignoring the characteristics of the learned policies, which makes it hard to predict their properties.

Method: The authors propose a framework with vanishing entropy regularization and temperature decoupling to create convergent and interpretable optimal policies.

Result: The method ensures convergence to interpretable and diversity-preserving policies while enabling accurate estimation of associated return distributions.

Conclusion: This framework provides a novel and interpretable approach to optimal policy convergence in RL, addressing key challenges in policy characterization.

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Motivation: To enhance model performance across various domains by controlling and optimizing output entropy in a computationally efficient manner.

Method: The ERA paradigm applies specially designed activations to model outputs to constrain their sampling entropy above set thresholds.

Result: ERA improved metrics for large language models (e.g., 37.4% boost in specific test scores), reinforcement learning tasks (30% improvement over strong baselines), and image classification (+0.69% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet).

Conclusion: Output activation for entropy control is a powerful mechanism that enhances both performance and computational efficiency across diverse applications.

Abstract: We propose ERA, a new paradigm that constrains the sampling entropy above
given thresholds by applying specially designed activations to the outputs of
models. Our approach demonstrates broad effectiveness across different domains:
1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for
Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning
agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as
SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing
ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a
computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as
a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing
simpler and more robust algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Linearizer that enables the treatment of conventionally nonlinear functions as linear through redefined vector spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply linear algebra's extensive toolkit to nonlinear mappings by redefining vector spaces.

Method: The authors use invertible neural networks and a linear operator to construct new vector spaces for which nonlinear functions become linear, termed Linearizer.

Result: The Linearizer architecture enables a single-step sampling for diffusion models, enforces idempotency for globally projective generative models, and achieves modular style transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework extends the applicability of linear algebra to nonlinear mappings and offers practical benefits in diffusion models, generative modeling, and style transfer.

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents an ant colony-inspired method for classifying industrial systems' operational states and forecasting maintenance needs based on temperature data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently and accurately determining if a production line system is operating correctly (In Control) or facing issues (Out of Control) is critical for minimizing disruptions, optimizing maintenance schedules, and ensuring product quality.

Method: The method mimics ant colony behavior, using digital representations of ant activities to generate scores based on temperature readings, such as Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score, which collectively indicate system conditions.

Result: Through the application on potato chip frying lines, the framework demonstrated its ability to adaptively classify system states and predict transitions requiring maintenance using real-time data.

Conclusion: This approach successfully offers an adaptive, interpretable, and bio-inspired process monitoring framework that can improve predictive maintenance in complex industrial environments.

Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting
rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control
(OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant
colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions
requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides
the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of
eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital
ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences,
representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a
Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such
as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection
of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified
Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an
Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics,
imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base
Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the
Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the
main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of
transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach
provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and
predictive maintenance in industrial environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs), a novel approach for improving the performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by enabling neurons to learn dynamics during training, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional neuron models in SNNs, such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which lack complex temporal dynamics and scalability.

Method: The authors propose LNMs, a parametric framework for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that allows neuron dynamics to be learned directly from training data, using low-degree polynomial parameterizations for efficient and stable training.

Result: LNMs demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, showcasing their scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: LNMs represent a significant advancement for deep SNNs by making them more scalable and capable of capturing rich temporal dynamics, paving the way for high-performance spiking architectures.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative
to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing sparse and asynchronous
processing through discrete spike-based computation. However, the performance
of deep SNNs remains limited by their reliance on simple neuron models, such as
the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which cannot capture rich temporal
dynamics. While more expressive neuron models exist, they require careful
manual tuning of hyperparameters and are difficult to scale effectively. This
difficulty is evident in the lack of successful implementations of complex
neuron models in high-performance deep SNNs. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs). LNMs are a general,
parametric formulation for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that learn
neuron dynamics during training. By learning neuron dynamics directly from
data, LNMs enhance the performance of deep SNNs. We instantiate LNMs using
low-degree polynomial parameterizations, enabling efficient and stable
training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets,
including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS. LNMs offer a
promising path toward more scalable and high-performing spiking architectures.

### [403] [Co-design is powerful and not free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08368)
*Yi Zhang,Yue Xie,Tao Sun,Fumiya Iida*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This study explores morphology-control co-design in robots, embedding both parameters in a single neural network to optimize performance. It concludes that co-design benefits robots in complex scenarios, while control-only optimization suffices for well-suited morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when morphology-control co-design is necessary for optimizing robotic performance.

Method: Unified framework embedding morphology and control into a single neural network, optimizing them jointly via case studies in obstacle-constrained robotic tasks.

Result: Co-design improves performance in scenarios where morphology mismatches tasks, but control-only optimization is sufficient for baseline morphologies.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into embodied intelligence and practical guidance for robot design, clarifying when co-design versus control-only optimization is beneficial.

Abstract: Robotic performance emerges from the coupling of body and controller, yet it
remains unclear when morphology-control co-design is necessary. We present a
unified framework that embeds morphology and control parameters within a single
neural network, enabling end-to-end joint optimization. Through case studies in
static-obstacle-constrained reaching, we evaluate trajectory error, success
rate, and collision probability. The results show that co-design provides clear
benefits when morphology is poorly matched to the task, such as near obstacles
or workspace boundaries, where structural adaptation simplifies control.
Conversely, when the baseline morphology already affords sufficient capability,
control-only optimization often matches or exceeds co-design. By clarifying
when control is enough and when it is not, this work advances the understanding
of embodied intelligence and offers practical guidance for embodiment-aware
robot design.

### [404] [Type, Ability, and Effect Systems: Perspectives on Purity, Semantics, and Expressiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07582)
*Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper provides a semantic baseline definition of purity in programming and proposes a new synthesis for type, ability, and effect systems to improve their expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to assess programming systems that separate pure computation from effectful interactions while addressing usability and precision issues.

Method: The paper introduces a semantic definition of purity inspired by contextual equivalence and measures expressiveness by the degree of completeness. It analyzes minimal effect and capability systems to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that effect and capability systems are incomparable in expressiveness. It proposes a synthesis combining type, ability, and effect systems to improve upon traditional designs.

Conclusion: The paper raises the standard for evaluating effect-typing systems and offers a new approach to combine strengths while overcoming weaknesses of existing systems.

Abstract: Programming benefits from a clear separation between pure, mathematical
computation and impure, effectful interaction with the world. Existing
approaches to enforce this separation include monads, type-and-effect systems,
and capability systems. All share a tension between precision and usability,
and each one has non-obvious strengths and weaknesses.
  This paper aims to raise the bar in assessing such systems. First, we propose
a semantic definition of purity, inspired by contextual equivalence, as a
baseline independent of any specific typing discipline. Second, we propose that
expressiveness should be measured by the degree of completeness, i.e., how many
semantically pure terms can be typed as pure. Using this measure, we focus on
minimal meaningful effect and capability systems and show that they are
incomparable, i.e., neither subsumes the other in terms of expressiveness.
  Based on this result, we propose a synthesis and show that type, ability, and
effect systems combine their respective strengths while avoiding their
weaknesses. As part of our formal model, we provide a logical relation to
facilitate proofs of purity and other properties for a variety of effect typing
disciplines.

### [405] [The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07851)
*Willem Heijltjes*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension of the Functional Machine Calculus to model branching and looping control flows, enabling the embedding of imperative programming features into a lambda-calculus-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify imperative and functional programming paradigms by extending the lambda-calculus to support control flow operations and computational effects.

Method: It employs the Krivine machine with enhancements like multiple operand stacks for effects and a continuation stack for control flow, ensuring confluent reduction and simple type systems.

Result: The extended calculus faithfully embeds a minimal imperative language with features such as conditionals, iteration, exception handling, and guarantees termination without iteration.

Conclusion: The proposed model bridges functional and imperative computations, ensuring strong normalization and termination while maintaining intuitive operational and reduction semantics alongside a solid type system.

Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to
unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the
lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed
termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control
flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order
computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and
non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value
lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's
call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to
branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a
minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception
handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the
(simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand
stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential,
branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation
and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and
strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These
properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified
functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct
and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.

*Corban Rivera,Grayson Byrd,Meghan Booker,Bethany Kemp,Allison Gaines,Emma Holmes,James Uplinger,Celso M de Melo,David Handelman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLEET is a hybrid framework combining LLM and formal planning to produce optimized multi-robot schedules from natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language coordination for heterogeneous robot teams is challenging due to the limitations of language-based planners and purely formal methods.

Method: Combines an LLM front-end for task graph generation and robot-task fitness matrix creation, with a formal MILP-based back-end for optimized scheduling.

Result: FLEET shows improved success on multi-robot coordination tasks in benchmarks and hardware trials with quadruped robots.

Conclusion: FLEET effectively bridges formal and language-based methods to achieve state-of-the-art multi-robot schedule optimization.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

*Girolamo Oddo,Roberto Nuca,Matteo Parsani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a data-driven approach using a lightweight encoder-decoder model with GRU layers to predict the future state of a vehicle under dynamic conditions, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing dynamic models for vehicles often faces challenges due to limited structural information, especially in autonomous driving applications where detailed vehicle design knowledge is unavailable.

Method: The authors utilized a lightweight encoder-decoder model built on Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers to create correlations between past vehicle states, onboard measurements, and driver control actions.

Result: Their proposed model achieved a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% under extreme dynamic conditions and displayed strong robustness against noisy input data.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven model effectively predicts vehicle dynamics while maintaining physical signal consistency and independence from physical constraints.

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

*Cael Yasutake,Zachary Kingston,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated inverse kinematics solver that combines greedy initialization with Jacobian-based optimization, achieving superior accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing IK solvers, which either lack versatility (analytical methods) or are computationally expensive and prone to local minima (numerical methods).

Method: Developed a hybrid solver (HJCD-IK) using a GPU-accelerated approach that combines greedy coordinate descent for initialization and a Jacobian-based routine for optimization.

Result: The solver provides improved convergence speed and accuracy compared to alternatives, while maintaining a favorable accuracy-latency balance and generating high-quality sample distributions.

Conclusion: HJCD-IK advances the state-of-the-art in IK problem-solving by demonstrating significant performance gains and is shared as open-source to aid further research.

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

### [409] [AVO: Amortized Value Optimization for Contact Mode Switching in Multi-Finger Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07548)
*Adam Hung,Fan Yang,Abhinav Kumar,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which integrates a learned value function into trajectory optimization for dexterous manipulation tasks, enhancing overall performance and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous manipulation tasks involve switching between contact modes. Existing methods optimize sub-tasks independently, leading to limitations in performance and computational inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed AVO method incorporates a learned value function that predicts future task performance into the cost function of trajectory optimization, using its gradients to guide the optimizer toward better overall solutions.

Result: AVO improves performance on a screwdriver grasping and turning task in simulation and real-world tests, achieving better results while using 50% less computational budget compared to traditional trajectory optimization methods.

Conclusion: AVO effectively bridges individually optimized sub-tasks, reduces computational requirements, and enhances task performance for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

### [410] [Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07611)
*Jingyang You,Hanna Kurniawati,Lashika Medagoda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces primitives (IPIM) enabling sampling-based planners to efficiently use neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) for inspecting complex infrastructures, dramatically reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of infrastructure necessitates safe and efficient inspection. Traditional planners consume excessive memory, especially when handling implicit models like neural SDFs.

Method: The researchers propose Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), enabling inspection planners to operate entirely with neural SDFs without relying on explicit environment models.

Result: Evaluation on real-world scenarios shows the proposed method retains trajectory quality comparable to state-of-the-art planners, while achieving up to 70x memory reduction.

Conclusion: IPIM offers a significant advancement in inspection planning for complex structures, combining low memory usage with effective trajectory generation.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.

*Alexander Du,Emre Adabag,Gabriel Bravo,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GATO, a GPU-accelerated tool for solving batched trajectory optimization (TO) problems, delivering real-time performance for moderate batch sizes required in modern MPC applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational challenges of solving nonlinear trajectory optimization (TO) problems in real-time for applications needing moderate batch sizes, which is unachievable with existing GPU-accelerated methods.

Method: The GATO solver is co-designed across algorithms, software, and hardware, leveraging parallelism (block-, warp-, and thread-level) for enhanced performance. It is open source and tailored for moderate batch sizes.

Result: GATO achieves 18-21x speedups over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases, improving disturbance rejection, convergence behavior, and industrial manipulator performance.

Conclusion: GATO addresses a key gap in trajectory optimization solvers, providing an open-source, efficient, and high-performance tool for real-time MPC applications in moderate batch size regimes.

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPaSM, a GPU-parallelized framework for solving sequential robot manipulation tasks with real-time efficiency, achieving a speedup of 4000× over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time and large-scale sequential robot manipulation tasks remain computationally challenging, requiring innovative solutions for trajectory optimization across complex constraints.

Method: SPaSM leverages optimized CUDA kernels for GPU-parallelized constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization, adopting a two-stage particle optimization strategy.

Result: Experimental benchmarks highlight solution times in the millisecond range and a 100% success rate, showcasing SPaSM's significant speedup and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SPaSM offers transformative advancements in trajectory optimization, enabling large-scale manipulation tasks with unprecedented speed and accuracy through full GPU utilization.

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Emerging-Barrier Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) to enforce constraints in diffusion models effectively, avoiding performance issues and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation caused by constraints in Model-Based Diffusion due to sample inefficiency and improve computational cost-effectiveness.

Method: The EB-MBD approach uses gradually introduced barrier constraints inspired by interior point methods to enhance solution quality. Sampling liveliness is analyzed iteratively to optimize barrier parameter scheduling.

Result: EB-MBD achieves better solution quality in 2D and 3D scenarios compared to Model-Based Diffusion, with significantly lower computational requirements than projection-based methods.

Conclusion: Introducing emerging barrier constraints can solve performance issues in Model-Based Diffusion while maintaining efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistically safe planning and control framework for bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain under uncertainty, using Model Predictive Control, Gaussian Process regression, and Conformal Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to navigate rough terrains while ensuring safety and dynamic feasibility under uncertain terrain conditions.

Method: The methods include using Gaussian Process regression to model uncertain terrain, constructing confidence intervals through Conformal Prediction, and implementing a high-level Model Predictive Control framework with contraction-based reachable tubes and torque control laws.

Result: The proposed framework ensures safe traversal, goal reachability, and state convergence even in uncertain terrain conditions. Effectiveness was verified through physics-based simulations of Digit robot in MuJoCo environment.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a probabilistic safety-guaranteed approach for bipedal robot locomotion across rough terrains, providing guarantees on stability and reachability.

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that injects perceptual hallucinations into autonomous vehicle simulations to study their impact on safety, significantly advancing fault injection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety concerns related to perception failures in autonomous vehicles, which are a leading cause of accidents.

Method: The paper proposes a hallucination injection framework that introduces six types of faults into an open-source simulator and conducts over 18,350 simulations to analyze their safety outcomes.

Result: The study validates the framework and shows certain hallucination types, like perceptual latency and drift, increase collision risks, demonstrating the utility of the proposed approach for AV safety evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, statistically validated, and component-agnostic toolset to accelerate AV safety validations, support resilient design, and reduce time-to-market.

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a clustering-based technique to extract routine logs from UI activities, showing superiority to existing methods, especially under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods primarily extract actions within routines and do not effectively address inconsistent execution (noise). This highlights the need for accurate discovery of routine-type models for robotic process automation.

Method: A clustering-based approach was developed to extract routine logs, designed to handle varying levels of noise. Tests were conducted on nine UI logs with different noise levels, comparing the technique to adapted existing methods.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, especially under noisy conditions, based on standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a superior method for routine log extraction, paving the way for more reliable creation of routine-type models in robotic process mining.

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

*YuHang Tang,Yixuan Lou,Pengfei Han,Haoming Song,Xinyi Ye,Dong Wang,Bin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrajSkill is a framework for enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills using human demonstration videos by leveraging sparse optical flow trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the embodiment gap between human bodies and robot manipulators to enable efficient skill transfer using human demonstration videos.

Method: Human motions are represented as sparse optical flow trajectories, which remove morphological variations while preserving dynamics, conditioned on visual and textual inputs. This combination synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and executable actions.

Result: Experiments show TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6% and KVD by 36.6% compared to the state-of-the-art and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7%. Real-robot tests validate its effectiveness in kitchen manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: TrajSkill demonstrates effective human-to-robot manipulation skill transfer while closing the morphology gap, indicating its potential for practical cross-embodiment applications.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA enhances Vision-Language-Action models with reasoning capabilities and efficient inference, achieving better performance in human-robot interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with implicit human intention reasoning necessary for complex real-world interactions.

Method: IntentionVLA introduces curriculum training and reasoning-guided data with intention inference, spatial grounding, and embodied reasoning, followed by finetuning for action generation.

Result: IntentionVLA achieves up to twice the success rate of baselines in out-of-distribution tasks and 40% success in zero-shot human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: IntentionVLA demonstrates significant improvements in next-generation human-robot interaction systems and advances the capability of embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

*Grace Cai,Nithin Parepally,Laura Zheng,Ming C. Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents the Generalized Micro-mobility Model (GM3), a unified physics-based model for micro-mobility vehicles that incorporates tire and load dynamics missed by traditional models like the Kinematic Bicycle Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for micro-mobility vehicle dynamics overlook key physical factors like tire slip, load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean, which limits their accuracy in real-world applications across diverse vehicle types.

Method: The authors developed GM3, a physics-based tire-level model using the tire brush representation, supporting various wheel configurations and dynamics. They also created a model-agnostic simulation framework for comparison and analysis.

Result: The GM3 model was validated through simulations and empirical analysis, including comparisons with traditional models (e.g., KBM) and empirical validation on Stanford Drone Dataset’s deathCircle scene for multiple vehicle types.

Conclusion: GM3 demonstrates enhanced accuracy and versatility in capturing the dynamics of diverse micro-mobility vehicles, offering a substantial improvement over traditional modeling approaches.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

### [420] [DM1: MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for 1-Step Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07865)
*Guowei Zou,Haitao Wang,Hejun Wu,Yukun Qian,Yuhang Wang,Weibing Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flow-based generative models for robotic manipulation suffer from representation collapse, leading to failures in precise tasks. DM1 introduces dispersive regularization in MeanFlow to prevent collapse and maintain one-step sampling efficiency, achieving faster inference and higher success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise and robust control in robotic manipulation requires learning multi-modal action distributions. Current flow-based methods are promising but suffer from representation collapse, hindering their efficacy in exact manipulation.

Method: DM1 integrates dispersive regularization within the MeanFlow framework, applying it across multiple intermediate layers to ensure diverse representations. This avoids representation collapse without extra network modules or special training procedures.

Result: DM1 achieves up to 20-40 times faster inference speeds and improves success rates by 10-20% compared to existing methods, with near-perfect success rates in certain tasks. It also successfully transfers from simulation to real-world robots, validating its robustness.

Conclusion: DM1 establishes a novel and efficient approach leveraging representation regularization to significantly improve flow-based manipulation policies, contributing to both efficiency and robust robotic manipulation performance.

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces USIM, a simulation-based multi-task Vision-Language-Action dataset for underwater robots, and proposes U0, a model achieving 80% success rate in key underwater robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing autonomous multi-task intelligence for underwater robots is challenging due to scarce high-quality underwater datasets.

Method: The paper proposes USIM, a dataset with detailed simulation-based interactions and introduces U0, a VLA model utilizing multimodal fusion and a perception focus enhancement module.

Result: The U0 model achieves an 80% success rate in tasks like inspection and reduces target distance by 21.2% in mobile manipulation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: USIM and the U0 model pave the way for scalable underwater dataset construction and enhanced task autonomy in robotic applications.

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task
autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater
robots.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhancement to the Falcon model for social navigation, adding a collision risk prediction module, evaluated in the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve autonomous navigation systems for dynamic, human-populated environments by enabling agents to navigate safely while complying with social norms.

Method: The method involves adding a Proactive Risk Perception Module to the Falcon model, which predicts collision risk scores based on distance to surrounding humans, enhancing spatial awareness.

Result: The approach achieved 2nd place among 16 teams in the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge, showing improved personal space compliance in dynamic indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Integrating collision risk prediction into navigation systems improves social compliance, spatial awareness, and overall navigation performance in crowded environments.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualTHOR, a simulation platform for dual-arm humanoid robots, and Proprio-MLLM, a model that improves embodiment awareness. Proprio-MLLM shows a 19.75% improvement in planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) underperform in complex, long-horizon tasks involving humanoid robots due to lack of suitable simulation platforms and insufficient embodiment awareness.

Method: The authors developed a simulator (DualTHOR) and proposed Proprio-MLLM, which integrates proprioceptive information, motion-based position embedding, and a cross-spatial encoder to improve planning for humanoid robotics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Proprio-MLLM surpasses existing MLLMs, achieving an average 19.75% improvement in planning tasks within the DualTHOR environment.

Conclusion: Combining DualTHOR and Proprio-MLLM addresses critical limitations in MLLM-based planning for humanoid robotics, representing a significant advance in embodied intelligence with practical tools for future research.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRACE is a framework that bridges the gap between semantic reasoning in Vision-Language Models and precise robotic manipulation by grounding high-level reasoning into executable analytic concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in performing generalized manipulation tasks in unstructured environments due to the disconnection between semantic reasoning and physical execution.

Method: GRACE uses Vision-Language Models combined with mathematically defined blueprints (EACs) that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics to plan motion trajectories and provide low-level robot control.

Result: Experiments showed strong zero-shot generalization capabilities across various articulated objects in simulated and real environments, without the need for task-specific training.

Conclusion: GRACE enables robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation through a unified grounded framework, demonstrating semantic-physical alignment for effective execution.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using angle-axis representation to address orientation learning challenges in SO(3), ensuring smoother trajectories under multiple constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address orientation learning difficulties caused by the non-Euclidean rotation group SO(3) when incorporating multiple local constraints.

Method: Propose an angle-axis-based weighted average mechanism that generates fused trajectories incorporating constraints in SO(3).

Result: Simulation and experiments show the method adapts orientations effectively, minimizes angular acceleration, and manages multiple constraints simultaneously with reduced acceleration costs.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates distortion challenges in SO(3), enabling Euclidean algorithms to work in non-Euclidean spaces while achieving better orientation learning outcomes.

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CURE introduces a method to break down uncertainty in LLM-based robotic planning, addressing issues of reliability by distinguishing between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, while effective in generating plans for robots, often produce unreliable results due to hallucinations, overconfidence, and lack of nuanced uncertainty estimation.

Method: CURE decomposes uncertainty into epistemic (task clarity & familiarity) and intrinsic components using tools like random network distillation paired with MLP regression on LLM features.

Result: Experiments in kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement show CURE's effectiveness in generating uncertainty estimates closely matching execution outcomes.

Conclusion: CURE improves reliability in LLM-based robotic planning by addressing nuanced uncertainty categories, making it safer and more aligned with real-world execution outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

Motivation: To address the global scarcity of expert sonographers, especially in resource-limited regions, and improve liver ultrasound diagnostics.

Method: The study develops an AI-powered 6-degrees-of-freedom cable-driven robot integrating multi-modal perception and memory attention, equipped to acquire expert-level liver ultrasound imagery autonomously.

Result: The system successfully demonstrated expert-level ultrasound across various scenarios, including motion-intensive conditions and underserved areas.

Conclusion: The work showcases the potential of autonomous ultrasound robots to enhance diagnostics accessibility, especially in challenging or underserved environments.

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level
diagnostics in underserved regions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve control methodologies for underconstrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots, especially in real-world dynamic environments.

Method: A comparative analysis between PID controllers and reinforcement learning methods (DDPG, PPO, and TRPO) was conducted by testing performance on various trajectories with time discretization constraints.

Result: TRPO achieved the lowest RMS errors, showed robustness against control update intervals, and managed noisy environments effectively.

Conclusion: TRPO demonstrates robust control performance, reduced dependency on high-frequency feedback, and computational efficiency, making it viable for complex robotic tasks and future advanced applications.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of classical and modern control methods
for real-world Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), focusing on
underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern
reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Trust Region Policy
Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other
methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various

updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable
control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency
sensor feedback and computational demands. These findings highlight TRPO's

*Baoyang Chen,Xian Xu,Huamin Qu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how complex multi-agent AI can be made intuitively understandable using an interactive robotic artwork called Airy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of safety, trust, and public oversight as industrial robots increasingly operate in shared human environments.

Method: The authors designed an interactive installation where two robot arms compete to snap a bedsheet skyward, using principles like competition, embodied familiarity, and sensory metaphors to visually map the robots' intentions.

Result: Audiences from five international exhibitions successfully interpreted the robots' strategies, emotions, and cooperation in real time, demonstrating engagement and understanding.

Conclusion: Sensory metaphors and interactive designs can effectively turn opaque AI systems into publicly interpretable interfaces, promoting understanding and trust.

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public
interface.

### [432] [Reliability of Single-Level Equality-Constrained Inverse Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08406)
*Filip Bečanović,Kosta Jovanović,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fast and robust single-level method for inverse optimal control (IOC) that's resilient to noise and significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional bilevel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current IOC methods, which are either too slow or too sensitive to noise, and improve their applicability in modeling human motion.

Method: Introduced a single-level reformulation of the bilevel IOC approach, tested through simulations with a human-like planar reaching task.

Result: The proposed single-level method is robust to high levels of noise and reduces computation time by a factor of 15 compared to a classical bilevel implementation.

Conclusion: The single-level formulation provides an efficient and noise-resilient alternative to existing bilevel IOC methods for analyzing human motion.

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

*Bibekananda Patra,Rajeevlochana G. Chittawadigi,Sandipan Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CAD-based method to validate and estimate the largest collision-free sphere (CFS) for a Stewart-Gough platform manipulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for efficiently validating the collision-free operational space of spatial parallel manipulators, specifically their largest collision-free sphere.

Method: The method involves using a CAD software API to automatically update the manipulator's moving platform position, sampling points within a shell enclosing the CFS, and checking each pair of legs for collisions.

Result: The proposed approach allows validation of precomputed CFS and can estimate the CFS for spatial parallel manipulators, ensuring collision avoidance.

Conclusion: This CAD API-based method provides an automated and reliable way to identify and validate collision-free operational spaces for manipulators.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

*Jason Jabbour,Dong-Ki Kim,Max Smith,Jay Patrikar,Radhika Ghosal,Youhui Wang,Ali Agha,Vijay Janapa Reddi,Shayegan Omidshafiei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLUESTICK, a method for recovering the performance of pruned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which often face significant degradation after pruning. GLUESTICK involves a corrective interpolation step to restore functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in VLA models for robotics, their deployment on resource-limited hardware remains challenging, and pruning—an effective compression method—is underexplored in this domain. Additionally, pruning often causes major performance drops and safety issues.

Method: The GLUESTICK method performs a one-time interpolation between weights of dense and pruned models in order to calculate a corrective term, which is then applied during inference. It is a post-pruning recovery strategy that is algorithm-agnostic, introduces a single hyperparameter, and requires no additional training.

Result: GLUESTICK effectively recovers functionality in pruned VLA models, achieving competitive memory efficiency while significantly restoring success rates and lowering safety violations across various architectures and robotic tasks.

Conclusion: GLUESTICK provides a simple yet effective solution for addressing performance degradation in pruned VLA models, making them more deployable in resource-constrained robotic applications without sacrificing much efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DexMan, a framework that converts human video demonstrations into bimanual manipulation skills for humanoid robots, showcasing superior accuracy and efficiency without requiring extensive manual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an efficient bimanual manipulation framework that eliminates the need for extensive manual input, such as depth sensors or calibrated cameras, by translating human video demonstrations into skills for robots.

Method: DexMan converts third-person human video demonstrations into robot skills, using a combination of humanoid robot control, reinforcement learning (RL), and novel contact-based rewards, while estimating hand-object poses from noisy real-world videos.

Result: DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in the TACO benchmark for object pose estimation and a 19% success rate improvement in reinforcement learning tasks on the OakInk-v2 dataset.

Conclusion: DexMan advances dexterous manipulation by removing costly data requirements and enabling scalable training, performing well on real-world and synthetic videos for humanoid robot skill generation.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse
datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

*Xiuwei Xu,Angyuan Ma,Hankun Li,Bingyao Yu,Zheng Zhu,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces R2RGen, a method for real-to-real 3D data generation, enhancing robot policy generalization using point cloud data without simulations or renderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of spatial generalization in robotic manipulation by reducing the reliance on extensive human demonstrations while overcoming limitations like fixed-base setups or predefined viewpoints.

Method: The authors propose R2RGen, a framework that augments real-world pointcloud observation-action pairs using annotation for scene parsing, group-wise augmentation for multi-object setups, and camera-aware processing for alignment with real-world sensors.

Result: R2RGen improves data efficiency and outperforms other approaches in enabling generalizable visuomotor policies, showcased through extensive experiments, including mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: R2RGen is an efficient, flexible data generation framework that facilitates scaling and real-world application for generalized robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

### [437] [DexNDM: Closing the Reality Gap for Dexterous In-Hand Rotation via Joint-Wise Neural Dynamics Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08556)
*Xueyi Liu,He Wang,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework enabling the transfer of object manipulation policies trained in simulations into the real world by addressing the "reality gap" through a dynamics model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling in-hand object rotation in robotics has been limited by the challenge of sim-to-real transfer due to contact-rich dynamics, leaving prior work constrained to simple or customized setups.

Method: The framework uses a joint-wise dynamics model that adapts policy actions by learning from limited real-world data, relying on data efficiency, dynamic factorization across joints, and autonomous data collection.

Result: The proposed approach achieves robust object rotation for diverse shapes, extreme aspect ratios, and varied wrist orientations, validated through real-world experiments and complex task teleoperation.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a significant step forward for sim-to-real transfer in dexterous manipulation, offering a highly generalizable and effective framework for real-world applications.

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

*Hongyu Li,Lingfeng Sun,Yafei Hu,Duy Ta,Jennifer Barry,George Konidaris,Jiahui Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NovaFlow enables zero-shot robotic manipulation by converting task descriptions into actionable plans, leveraging video synthesis and object flow without demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of executing novel manipulation tasks zero-shot without relying on embodiment-matched data or fine-tuning.

Method: NovaFlow uses a video generation model to synthesize task videos, distills them into 3D actionable object flow using perception modules, and computes rigid/deformable object manipulations through grasp proposals and trajectory optimization.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated its effectiveness in manipulating rigid, articulated, and deformable objects using different robotic platforms like Franka arms and Spot robots without prior training or demonstrations.

Conclusion: NovaFlow achieves transferable task execution across robotic embodiments by decoupling task understanding from low-level control, demonstrating zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

### [439] [Scalable Offline Metrics for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08571)
*Animikh Aich,Adwait Kulkarni,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study revisits the challenge of evaluating robotic planning models for environments like autonomous driving, finding a poor correlation between offline (dataset-based) and online (real-world) evaluations. It proposes an epistemic-uncertainty-based metric that improves correlation and validity across settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in accurate offline evaluations of robotic planning models when extrapolating their behavior to real-world online scenarios, which often results in test-time errors.

Method: The study employs extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments to analyze the relationship between offline and online evaluations. It investigates an epistemic uncertainty-based metric for predicting potential-error events in closed-loop settings.

Result: The proposed epistemic uncertainty-based method improves offline-to-online evaluation correlation by over 13% compared to established offline metrics. Greater improvements are observed in real-world settings.

Conclusion: Current offline evaluation methods are insufficient for predicting real-world robotic system performance. The proposed epistemic-uncertainty model significantly enhances the efficacy of offline metrics, narrowing the gap between simulated and real-world evaluations.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

*Rocktim Jyoti Das,Harsh Singh,Diana Turmakhan,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Mingfei Han,Preslav Nakov,Fabio Pizzati,Ivan Laptev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents BLAZER, a framework that uses automatically generated training data for enhancing robotic manipulation policies using language model planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of limited data and model scaling in robotics compared to vision and language domains, as robotics datasets are often manually collected and curated.

Method: BLAZER leverages zero-shot capabilities of large language model planners to automatically generate diverse task demonstrations in simulation, fine-tuning the model without human supervision. It also enables state-to-sensor transfer.

Result: BLAZER improves zero-shot manipulation capabilities in both simulated and real environments, generalizes to tasks outside its training pool, and reduces reliance on large LLM models.

Conclusion: BLAZER helps bridge the gap in scaling data for robotics by automating dataset generation, enhancing generalization, and enabling effective skill transfer from simulation to real-world tasks.

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniFField, a unified neural feature field that integrates visual, geometric, and semantic features while incorporating uncertainty estimation for generalizable 3D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in understanding complex environments, needing both comprehensive scene comprehension and prediction uncertainty estimation to make robust decisions.

Method: The paper proposes UniFField, a voxel-based neural feature framework that processes visual, semantic, and geometric information while predicting uncertainties via incremental integration of RGB-D images as robots explore new environments.

Result: UniFField provides accurate uncertainty estimations for scene reconstruction and semantic prediction and effectively supports an active object search task in robotic environments.

Conclusion: UniFField enhances robotic decision-making by offering a unified and generalizable framework for 3D scene understanding with reliable uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

*Zixuan Feng,Sadia Afroz,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Generative AI (GenAI) impacts software developers' burnout using a mixed-methods study, finding that while GenAI elevates job demands leading to higher burnout, job resources can offset this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dual impact of Generative AI on software developers, particularly its potential to increase burnout despite promising productivity benefits.

Method: The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining a survey of 442 developers with both quantitative analysis (PLS-SEM, regression) and qualitative analysis of open-ended responses.

Result: Adopting GenAI raises developers' burnout by increasing job demands, but adequate job resources and positive perceptions of GenAI can mitigate these effects.

Conclusion: Though GenAI adoption presents challenges by increasing burnout, it also provides opportunities to balance these pressures through appropriate resource allocation and fostering positive attitudes among developers.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks a dedicated evaluation benchmark for urgent hot fixes, which are crucial for resolving time-critical software issues.

Method: The study mined 10 active Apache projects, identified potential hot fixes using Jira data, validated them manually, and created a dataset with 679 validated hot fixes and 110 reproducible ones, all enriched with metadata.

Result: HotBugs$.$jar includes 679 validated hot fixes, with 110 being reproducible with test suites, and has been integrated into the SBSE Challenge Track to enable further research.

Conclusion: HotBugs$.$jar is a significant resource for advancing the study of rapid debugging, automated repair, and software resilience, addressing a critical gap in hot-fix research.

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern

*Yubo Bai,Tapti Palit*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents RustAssure, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to safely transpile C code to Rust, with an 89.8% success rate for compilable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C codebases have inherent memory safety issues, and transitioning to Rust addresses these vulnerabilities. However, manually converting C to Rust is challenging and time-consuming.

Method: RustAssure uses large language models (LLMs) with prompt engineering to generate Rust code from C. To ensure accuracy, it employs differential symbolic testing to verify semantic equivalence between the original C functions and the transpiled Rust code.

Result: RustAssure successfully transpiled C code into compilable Rust for 89.8% of functions, achieving semantic equivalence for 69.9% of them.

Conclusion: This system demonstrates promise as a tool for enhancing software security by facilitating the conversion of legacy C code into memory-safe Rust code through automation and validation.

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APPFORGE, a benchmark for testing large language models' (LLMs) ability to develop full Android apps, reveals significant limitations, as even the best LLM (GPT-5) achieves only 18.8% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on isolated code tasks, lacking evaluation of LLMs' ability to build entire software systems. This study aims to address this gap.

Method: The paper introduces the APPFORGE benchmark, a dataset of 101 Android app development tasks. It uses a multi-agent system to summarize app functionalities, generate test cases, and evaluate performance automatically.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed poor performance in developing full Android apps, with GPT-5 performing best at 18.8% functionally correct applications.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to handle complex, multi-component software engineering challenges, and APPFORGE highlights critical inefficiencies, encouraging future improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

### [446] [Interleaved Learning and Exploration: A Self-Adaptive Fuzz Testing Framework for MLIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07815)
*Zeyu Sun,Jingjing Liang,Weiyi Wang,Chenyao Suo,Junjie Chen,Fanjiang Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLEX, a novel AI-driven fuzzing framework for MLIR that utilizes neural networks, sampling strategies, and feedback loops, significantly outperforming traditional fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIR's growth and complexity demand effective testing frameworks, as conventional fuzzing approaches fail to generate diverse and valid test cases capable of exposing subtle bugs.

Method: FLEX combines neural network-based program generation, perturbed sampling for diversity, and feedback-driven, self-adaptive iterative learning to create high-quality test inputs.

Result: FLEX discovered 80 new bugs during a 30-day campaign and achieved 3.5x more bug detection than the best baseline fuzzer in a 24-hour test, while also achieving 28.2% code coverage.

Conclusion: FLEX's self-adapting model and diversity-driven methods advance the testing of MLIR, demonstrating significant improvements over existing fuzzing tools and identifying critical bugs.

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

### [447] [Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834)
*Lingjun Liu,Feiran Qin,Owolabi Legunsen,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces IssueMut, a method for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories, resulting in discovering numerous new bugs in GCC and LLVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compiler bugs can have significant negative impacts, and the effectiveness of mutational fuzzing for bug detection depends on the quality of mutators used.

Method: IssueMut identifies patterns from bug histories to create mutators, processes 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports, and integrates these mutators into existing fuzzers.

Result: IssueMut effectively discovered 28 new bugs in GCC and 37 in LLVM, with 60 of them confirmed or fixed, demonstrating its usefulness.

Conclusion: Bug histories hold valuable insights that can improve compiler fuzzing, and IssueMut successfully leverages them for enhanced bug detection.

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

*Srijita Basu,Haraldsson Bengt,Miroslaw Staron,Christian Berger,Jennifer Horkoff,Magnus Almgren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes SoC vulnerabilities in automotive systems aligned with AUTOSAR, identifying root causes, impacted modules, and offering insights for improved security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of systematic analysis on SoC vulnerabilities in AUTOSAR-aligned automotive systems, especially for safety-critical environments.

Method: Analyzed 180 publicly reported SoC vulnerabilities mapped to a SoC software architecture model based on AUTOSAR principles, examining causes, affected modules, and mitigation delays.

Result: Identified 16 root causes, 56 affected modules, and highlighted vulnerability patterns with prolonged patch delays. Provided insights for detection, prioritization, and localization in SoC architectures.

Conclusion: The study offers a foundational understanding of SoC vulnerability patterns in AUTOSAR systems and actionable strategies to enhance security for automotive CPS platforms.

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

*Utku Boran Torun,Mehmet Taha Demircan,Mahmut Furkan Gön,Eray Tüzün*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-powered framework to improve bug tracking processes using large language models (LLMs) to automate reporting, reproducing, classifying, and patch generation, reducing time-to-fix and human overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiencies in traditional bug tracking systems, such as heavy reliance on manual processes, significant coordination gaps, delayed responses, and user frustration.

Method: The proposed method involves an AI-powered framework where users report bugs in natural language. LLMs refine reports, attempt reproduction, classify issues, generate patches, and handle no-code fixes, while humans oversee critical validations.

Result: The framework aims to reduce time-to-fix, minimize human input, accelerate response times, and improve collaboration in bug tracking, leading to enhanced software maintenance practices.

Conclusion: Integrating AI-driven automation into the bug tracking lifecycle enhances efficiency and user satisfaction, paving the way for a more streamlined and proactive approach to software maintenance.

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

*Alexander Hellwig,Nico Jansen,Bernhard Rumpe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique to improve reusability in software languages by allowing integration of whitespace-sensitive and whitespace-insensitive language modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditionally, integrating modular language components has been hindered by incompatibilities between whitespace-sensitive and insensitive languages, limiting reuse.

Method: A preprocessing technique is proposed that processes whitespace-insensitive modules to construct whitespace-sensitive languages before parsing.

Result: The approach was evaluated through reconstructing a simplified version of Python, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This method improves the reusability of language components, optimizing development time and enhancing software language quality.

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

### [451] [Beyond Grid-Locked Voxels: Neural Response Functions for Continuous Brain Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07342)
*Haomiao Chen,Keith W Jamison,Mert R. Sabuncu,Amy Kuceyeski*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Neural Response Function (NRF), which models fMRI brain responses as continuous functions over anatomical space, improving prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional flattened voxel approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fMRI encoding models overlook spatial context, anatomical information, and generalizability by treating brain responses as independent 1D voxel data.

Method: The NRF models fMRI activity as a continuous implicit function, predicting responses at any given spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, and integrates principles of local smoothness and cross-subject alignment.

Result: NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject and cross-subject tasks, achieving higher prediction accuracy and significantly reducing the training data size required.

Conclusion: The NRF framework demonstrates the potential of anatomically aware, continuous encoding models to enhance fMRI-based brain activity prediction, supporting flexible and efficient applications across individuals and resolutions.

Abstract: Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to
natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each
voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional
encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel
responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards
anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid.
We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI
activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat
vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit
function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI
space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation
decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary
spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the
model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses:
(1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns;
modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data
efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data
across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned
on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both
intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance
while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge,
NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened
voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D
space.

*Teng Fei,Srinivas Ravishankar,Hoko Nakada,Abhinav Uppal,Ian Jackson,Garrison W. Cottrell,Ryusuke Hayashi,Virginia R. de Sa*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to analyze monkey visual processing by decoding and encoding neural activity from ventral stream spiking datasets, enabling both perceptual reconstruction and visualization of preferred stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the neuroscience challenge of understanding how the primate brain transforms complex visual scenes into coherent perceptual experiences.

Method: Large-scale spiking datasets from macaques were analyzed through multi-electrode array recordings of ventral visual stream areas (V1, V4, IT cortex). The authors employed encoding and decoding models to reconstruct visual stimuli and map neural activity to visual features.

Result: They successfully reconstructed low-level and high-level features of visual stimuli from neural activity, confirming hierarchical organization of the ventral stream and identifying feature-specific neural ensembles with evolving selectivity post-stimulus.

Conclusion: The findings link neural activity to perception, demonstrating the feasibility and generalizability of perceptual reconstruction using large-scale primate neural recordings.

Abstract: Understanding how the primate brain transforms complex visual scenes into
coherent perceptual experiences remains a central challenge in neuroscience.
Here, we present a comprehensive framework for interpreting monkey visual
processing by integrating encoding and decoding approaches applied to two
large-scale spiking datasets recorded from macaque using THINGS images (THINGS
macaque IT Dataset (TITD) and THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset (TVSD)). We
leverage multi-electrode array recordings from the ventral visual
stream--including V1, V4, and inferotemporal (IT) cortex--to investigate how
distributed neural populations encode and represent visual information. Our
approach employs linear models to decode spiking activity into multiple latent
visual spaces (including CLIP and VDVAE embeddings) and reconstruct images
using state-of-the-art generative models. We further utilize encoding models to
map visual features back to neural activity, enabling visualization of the
"preferred stimuli" that drive specific neural ensembles. Analyses of both
datasets reveal that it is possible to reconstruct both low-level (e.g., color,
texture) and high-level (e.g., semantic category) features of visual stimuli
from population activity, with reconstructions preserving key perceptual
attributes as quantified by feature-based similarity metrics. The
spatiotemporal spike patterns reflect the ventral stream's hierarchical
organization with anterior regions representing complex objects and categories.
Functional clustering identifies feature-specific neural ensembles, with
temporal dynamics show evolving feature selectivity post-stimulus. Our findings
demonstrate feasible, generalizable perceptual reconstruction from large-scale
monkey neural recordings, linking neural activity to perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the relationship between brain states and responsiveness across different scales.

Method: A systematic review of physiological, computational, and quantitative methods applied to cellular, circuit, mesoscale, and macroscale levels, comparing data and models.

Result: Insights into mechanisms linking brain states and responses, with emphasis on methods like PCI for quantifying the relationship.

Conclusion: State-dependent responsiveness of the cerebral cortex is measurable and can be systematically analyzed using computational and quantitative approaches across various scales.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to review physiological and computational
aspects of the responsiveness of the cerebral cortex to stimulation, and how
responsiveness depends on the state of the system. This correspondence between
brain state and brain responsiveness (state-dependent responses) is outlined at
different scales from the cellular and circuit level, to the mesoscale and
macroscale level. At each scale, we review how quantitative methods can be used
to characterize network states based on brain responses, such as the
Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI). This description will compare data and
models, systematically and at multiple scales, with a focus on the mechanisms
that explain how brain responses depend on brain states.

TL;DR: This study explores optimizing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for post-stroke rehabilitation using simplified motor imagery tasks and finds shorter training sessions yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke rehabilitation remains challenging despite advanced acute treatments, with BCIs providing a promising alternative to promote neuroplasticity.

Method: Compared motor imagery tasks—affected hand movement/rest versus conventional left/right imagery—across datasets from healthy individuals and stroke patients. Analyzed with FBCSP and EEGNet algorithms; assessed session duration impact on BCI performance.

Result: Improved BCI performance with simplified motor imagery tasks and identified shorter training sessions as more effective.

Conclusion: Simplified motor imagery tasks paired with shorter training sessions enhance clinical outcomes in BCI-based stroke rehabilitation protocols.

Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and the second most common
cause of death worldwide. Although acute treatments have advanced, recovery
remains challenging and limited. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged
as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by promoting
neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain variable, and optimal
protocols have yet to be established. This study explores strategies to
optimize BCI-based rehabilitation by comparing motor imagery of affected hand
movement versus rest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor
imagery. This alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak
contralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients. Two datasets,
one from healthy individuals and one from stroke patients, were used to
evaluate the proposed approach. The results showed improved performance using
both FBCSP and EEGNet. Additionally, we investigated the impact of session
duration and found that shorter training sessions produced better BCI
performance than longer sessions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses death truncation in critical care treatment evaluation, introducing a robust method for personalizing treatment decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Truncation by death complicates evaluating dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) due to undefined outcomes, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The authors propose a principal stratification framework and derive an efficient and multiply robust estimator for multi-stage DTRs.

Result: The framework's robustness and efficiency were validated empirically and applied to electronic health records, demonstrating its practical advantages.

Conclusion: This novel methodology provides a valuable tool for optimizing personalized treatments while addressing critical limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Truncation by death, a prevalent challenge in critical care, renders
traditional dynamic treatment regime (DTR) evaluation inapplicable due to
ill-defined potential outcomes. We introduce a principal stratification-based

*Abdelhakim Benechehab,Gabriel Singer,Corentin Léger,Youssef Attia El Hili,Giuseppe Paolo,Albert Thomas,Maurizio Filippone,Balázs Kégl*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel bilevel optimization framework to train generative models using policy gradient methods, addressing limitations of Maximum Likelihood Estimation in aligning models to high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative model training methods largely rely on Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which has shown drawbacks in generalization and resistance to catastrophic forgetting. Alternative techniques using policy gradients require explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a bilevel optimization framework where the reward function is treated as an optimization variable in the outer problem, and the inner problem uses a policy gradient objective.

Result: The authors provide theoretical insights into the proposed optimization framework and demonstrate its generalizability across applications like tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: By integrating the reward signal optimization into the model training process, the approach offers a promising direction to align generative models without explicit reward signals. The release of code ensures reproducibility and further exploration.

Abstract: Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning
state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While
Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training
paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to
Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However,
these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable
in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative
models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address
this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function
is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a
policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a
theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and
extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as
tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the
code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .

### [457] [A Honest Cross-Validation Estimator for Prediction Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07649)
*Tianyu Pan,Vincent Z. Yu,Viswanath Devanarayan,Lu Tian*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework to enhance cross-validation by improving model performance estimates for specific training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of standard cross-validation that does not estimate the performance of the specific model recommended for future use but rather averages over data splits.

Method: The authors propose a random-effects model framework and develop two estimators: a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and an empirical Bayes estimator, which improve upon conventional cross-validation methods.

Result: The proposed estimators perform as well or better than the standard cross-validation and naive single-split estimators in simulations and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The new method offers a more accurate performance estimation by integrating random splits into a Bayesian framework, making it suitable for assessing models trained on specific training datasets.

Abstract: Cross-validation is a standard tool for obtaining a honest assessment of the
performance of a prediction model. The commonly used version repeatedly splits
data, trains the prediction model on the training set, evaluates the model
performance on the test set, and averages the model performance across
different data splits. A well-known criticism is that such cross-validation
procedure does not directly estimate the performance of the particular model
recommended for future use. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate
the performance of a model trained on a specific (random) training set. A naive
estimator can be obtained by applying the model to a disjoint testing set.
Surprisingly, cross-validation estimators computed from other random splits can
be used to improve this naive estimator within a random-effects model
framework. We develop two estimators -- a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and
an empirical Bayes estimator -- that perform similarly to or better than both
the conventional cross-validation estimator and the naive single-split
estimator. Simulations and a real-data example demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method.

*Wenbin Zhou,Shixiang Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that balances robustness and conservativeness in decision-making under uncertainty using data-driven, finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust optimization typically relies on ad hoc robustness levels, which can lead to suboptimal decisions. Existing methods provide limited guidance for choosing these levels.

Method: The authors develop a distribution-free approach with finite-sample guarantees for miscoverage and regret, enabling the exploration of the miscoverage-regret Pareto frontier.

Result: The framework improves finite-sample performance over existing methods, offers estimators for robust optimization policies, and supports cost-risk preference evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a principled approach to selecting robustness levels, aiding decision-makers in balancing uncertainty protection and conservativeness in critical scenarios.

Abstract: Robust optimization safeguards decisions against uncertainty by optimizing
against worst-case scenarios, yet their effectiveness hinges on a prespecified
robustness level that is often chosen ad hoc, leading to either insufficient
protection or overly conservative and costly solutions. Recent approaches using
conformal prediction construct data-driven uncertainty sets with finite-sample
coverage guarantees, but they still fix coverage targets a priori and offer
little guidance for selecting robustness levels. We propose a new framework
that provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage
and regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method
constructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto
frontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate
robustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is
simple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization
formulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing
approaches. These results offer the first principled data-driven methodology
for guiding robustness selection and empower practitioners to balance
robustness and conservativeness in high-stakes decision-making.

*Yuta Shikuri,Hironori Fujisawa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study proposes a graph partitioning method to create spatial segments for summarizing black-box predictors, improving interpretability in spatial prediction while addressing computational challenges with an efficient approximation scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adoption of spatial prediction models is limited due to the need for interpretability. Surrogate models can bridge this gap by providing understandable explanations for black-box predictors.

Method: The authors formulate spatial segmentation as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem to minimize variance within segments, and develop an approximation leveraging graph partitioning for computational efficiency.

Result: The experimental results confirm the proposed approximation method is computationally efficient in identifying spatial segments.

Conclusion: The graph partitioning approach and its approximation enhance the interpretability of spatial prediction models, making them more practical for industry applications.

Abstract: Spatial prediction refers to the estimation of unobserved values from
spatially distributed observations. Although recent advances have improved the
capacity to model diverse observation types, adoption in practice remains
limited in industries that demand interpretability. To mitigate this gap,
surrogate models that explain black-box predictors provide a promising path
toward interpretable decision making. In this study, we propose a graph
partitioning problem to construct spatial segments that minimize the sum of
within-segment variances of individual predictions. The assignment of data
points to segments can be formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming
problem. While this formulation potentially enables the identification of exact
segments, its computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the number of
data points increases. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an approximation
scheme that leverages the structural properties of graph partitioning.
Experimental results demonstrate the computational efficiency of this
approximation in identifying spatial segments.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses efficient estimation of a continuous ability parameter through sequential adaptive questioning, using Fisher information to minimize query usage while proving optimality under different regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the problem of efficiently estimating a continuous ability parameter within a desired margin of error using adaptive queries, relevant to fields like adaptive testing and online preference learning.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm that uses Fisher information to adaptively select questions, paired with a method-of-moments estimator and a novel test statistic to determine when the estimate is accurate.

Result: They prove that their Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings, overcoming challenges in query-parameter dependence through advanced statistical techniques.

Conclusion: The results support the use of simple and efficient adaptive testing methods for reliable parameter estimation, with rigorous theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a continuous ability parameter from
sequential binary responses by actively asking questions with varying
difficulties, a setting that arises naturally in adaptive testing and online
preference learning. Our goal is to certify that the estimate lies within a
desired margin of error, using as few queries as possible. We propose a simple
algorithm that adaptively selects questions to maximize Fisher information and
updates the estimate using a method-of-moments approach, paired with a novel
test statistic to decide when the estimate is accurate enough. We prove that
this Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both
fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the
best-arm identification literature. Our analysis overcomes a key technical
challenge in the fixed-budget setting -- handling the dependence between the
evolving estimate and the query distribution -- by exploiting a structural
symmetry in the model and combining large deviation tools with Ville's
inequality. Our results provide rigorous theoretical support for simple and
efficient adaptive testing procedures.

### [461] [On the Optimality of the Median-of-Means Estimator under Adversarial Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07867)
*Xabier de Juan,Santiago Mazuelas*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Median-of-Means (MoM) estimator's performance under adversarial contamination, deriving both upper and lower error bounds and demonstrating its optimality for certain distribution classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the robustness and performance of the widely used Median-of-Means (MoM) estimator under adversarially contaminated data, beyond standard Gaussian cases.

Method: The authors derived theoretical upper and lower error bounds for the MoM estimator under adversarial contamination, addressing multiple classes of distributions, including those with finite variance and specific moment conditions.

Result: The findings establish that MoM is minimax optimal for distributions with finite variance and also for some with infinite variance but satisfying moment conditions. However, it is shown to be sub-optimal for light-tailed distributions.

Conclusion: The research extends the understanding of MoM beyond Gaussian cases, providing significant theoretical insights into its strengths and limitations under adversarial contamination scenarios.

Abstract: The Median-of-Means (MoM) is a robust estimator widely used in machine
learning that is known to be (minimax) optimal in scenarios where samples are
i.i.d. In more grave scenarios, samples are contaminated by an adversary that
can inspect and modify the data. Previous work has theoretically shown the
suitability of the MoM estimator in certain contaminated settings. However, the
(minimax) optimality of MoM and its limitations under adversarial contamination
remain unknown beyond the Gaussian case. In this paper, we present upper and
lower bounds for the error of MoM under adversarial contamination for multiple
classes of distributions. In particular, we show that MoM is (minimax) optimal
in the class of distributions with finite variance, as well as in the class of
distributions with infinite variance and finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment. We
also provide lower bounds for MoM's error that match the order of the presented
upper bounds, and show that MoM is sub-optimal for light-tailed distributions.

*Seungsu Han,Juyoung Hwang,Won Chang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes StiCTAF, a novel enhancement for normalizing flows aiming to better capture complex posterior distributions such as multimodality and heavy tails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalizing flows with Gaussian bases often fail to approximate complex posterior distributions in Bayesian inference, especially those with multimodality and heavy tails.

Method: The proposed method, StiCTAF, uses a stick-breaking mixture base to mitigate mode-seeking bias, estimates local tail indices for unnormalized densities, and refines mixture components through shared backbones and tailored tail transformations.

Result: The approach shows improved tail recovery and better coverage of multiple modes in synthetic experiments and demonstrates practical benefits in real-world posterior inference analysis.

Conclusion: StiCTAF effectively enhances posterior approximation in Bayesian models, addressing mode-seeking bias and anisotropic tail modeling while enabling stable optimization and exact density evaluation.

Abstract: Normalizing flows with a Gaussian base provide a computationally efficient
way to approximate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference, but they
often struggle to capture complex posteriors with multimodality and heavy
tails. We propose a stick-breaking mixture base with component-wise tail
adaptation (StiCTAF) for posterior approximation. The method first learns a
flexible mixture base to mitigate the mode-seeking bias of reverse KL
divergence through a weighted average of component-wise ELBOs. It then
estimates local tail indices of unnormalized densities and finally refines each
mixture component using a shared backbone combined with component-specific tail
transforms calibrated by the estimated indices. This design enables accurate
mode coverage and anisotropic tail modeling while retaining exact density
evaluation and stable optimization. Experiments on synthetic posteriors
demonstrate improved tail recovery and better coverage of multiple modes
compared to benchmark models. We also present a real-data analysis illustrating
the practical benefits of our approach for posterior inference.

*Amitis Shidani,Tyler Farghly,Yang Sun,Habib Ganjgahi,George Deligiannidis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the trade-off between synthetic and real data, providing a framework for determining the optimal mix of the two to minimize test error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data often helps when real data is scarce, but improper usage introduces distribution mismatches, motivating a need to quantify the trade-off.

Method: The paper uses a learning-theoretic framework and algorithmic stability to derive generalization error bounds based on the Wasserstein distance between real and synthetic data distributions.

Result: An optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio exists, producing a U-shaped test error curve. Empirical validation is conducted on datasets like CIFAR-10 and clinical brain MRI.

Conclusion: Blending synthetic and real data effectively improves generalization, particularly in domain adaptation scenarios, with practical guidance provided for real-world applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data can improve generalization when real data is scarce, but
excessive reliance may introduce distributional mismatches that degrade
performance. In this paper, we present a learning-theoretic framework to
quantify the trade-off between synthetic and real data. Our approach leverages
algorithmic stability to derive generalization error bounds, characterizing the
optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio that minimizes expected test error as a
function of the Wasserstein distance between the real and synthetic
distributions. We motivate our framework in the setting of kernel ridge
regression with mixed data, offering a detailed analysis that may be of
independent interest. Our theory predicts the existence of an optimal ratio,
leading to a U-shaped behavior of test error with respect to the proportion of
synthetic data. Empirically, we validate this prediction on CIFAR-10 and a
clinical brain MRI dataset. Our theory extends to the important scenario of
domain adaptation, showing that carefully blending synthetic target data with
limited source data can mitigate domain shift and enhance generalization. We
conclude with practical guidance for applying our results to both in-domain and
out-of-domain scenarios.

*Parham Rezaei,Filip Kovacevic,Francesco Locatello,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of synthetic data in improving classifier performance, focusing on the impact of covariance shift and proposing covariance matching as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data is increasingly used for augmenting real datasets, but there is uncertainty about which data properties enhance prediction accuracy and minimize generalization error.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze high-dimensional regression to identify the role of mean and covariance shifts on generalization error and conduct empirical tests validating covariance matching on deep neural networks and generative models.

Result: The study reveals covariance shift as a key factor affecting generalization error in linear models, and demonstrates that covariance matching improves synthetic data usage across various scenarios and models.

Conclusion: Covariance matching proves to be an effective strategy for making synthetic data enhance prediction performance, applicable from linear models to deep neural networks, and shows superiority over other synthetic data selection methods.

Abstract: Despite the progress in the development of generative models, their
usefulness in creating synthetic data that improve prediction performance of
classifiers has been put into question. Besides heuristic principles such as
"synthetic data should be close to the real data distribution", it is actually
not clear which specific properties affect the generalization error. Our paper
addresses this question through the lens of high-dimensional regression.
Theoretically, we show that, for linear models, the covariance shift between
the target distribution and the distribution of the synthetic data affects the
generalization error but, surprisingly, the mean shift does not. Furthermore we
prove that, in some settings, matching the covariance of the target
distribution is optimal. Remarkably, the theoretical insights from linear
models carry over to deep neural networks and generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the covariance matching procedure (matching the covariance of
the synthetic data with that of the data coming from the target distribution)
performs well against several recent approaches for synthetic data selection,
across training paradigms, architectures, datasets and generative models used
for augmentation.

*Ivan Kirev,Lyuben Baltadzhiev,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of performative shifts caused by model-dependent changes in the test distribution and explores their impact on machine learning performance, providing methods to analyze and mitigate such effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, model-driven shifts in data distributions (performative shifts) degrade test-time performance, necessitating a robust framework to understand and mitigate them.

Method: The paper uses the PAC learning framework, introduces performative scenarios analyzing linear and general distribution shifts, and proposes a performative empirical risk function that offers unbiased risk estimates under shifted distributions.

Result: The approach demonstrates that PAC-learnable hypothesis spaces remain learnable even within performative scenarios, supported by both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that performative risk minimization is an effective strategy for addressing model-dependent distribution shifts while maintaining learnability in binary classification problems.

Abstract: Following the wide-spread adoption of machine learning models in real-world
applications, the phenomenon of performativity, i.e. model-dependent shifts in
the test distribution, becomes increasingly prevalent. Unfortunately, since
models are usually trained solely based on samples from the original
(unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased
test-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when
performative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the
classic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate
several performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in
the label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels
and the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which
depends only on data from the original distribution and on the type
performative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a
classifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative
risk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard
binary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered
performative scenarios. We also conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of
our performative risk minimization method and showcase benefits on synthetic
and real data.

### [466] [Optimal Stopping in Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08409)
*Yu-Han Wu,Quentin Berthet,Gérard Biau,Claire Boyer,Romuald Elie,Pierre Marion*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper discovers and analyzes a phenomenon in Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) where diffusion's final steps can degrade the quality of generated samples. The authors find that early stopping can enhance sample quality and offer theoretical explanations for its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why the final steps in diffusion degrade the sample quality in LDMs and provide a theoretical foundation to optimize generative performance.

Method: The researchers approach the problem by analyzing the relationship between latent dimension and stopping time in a Gaussian framework using linear autoencoders. They establish conditions for early stopping to minimize the distance between the generated and target distributions.

Result: The findings reveal that low-dimensional latent spaces benefit from early stopping, while high-dimensional spaces require later termination. Interactions with hyperparameters like score matching constraints are also highlighted. Experimental results validate these observations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the choice of stopping time is a critical hyperparameter in LDMs. The paper provides theoretical insights into how the latent dimension affects sample quality and emphasizes the practical importance of early stopping to improve generative results.

Abstract: We identify and analyze a surprising phenomenon of Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs) where the final steps of the diffusion can degrade sample quality. In
contrast to conventional arguments that justify early stopping for numerical
stability, this phenomenon is intrinsic to the dimensionality reduction in
LDMs. We provide a principled explanation by analyzing the interaction between
latent dimension and stopping time. Under a Gaussian framework with linear
autoencoders, we characterize the conditions under which early stopping is
needed to minimize the distance between generated and target distributions.
More precisely, we show that lower-dimensional representations benefit from
earlier termination, whereas higher-dimensional latent spaces require later
stopping time. We further establish that the latent dimension interplays with
other hyperparameters of the problem such as constraints in the parameters of
score matching. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets illustrate these
properties, underlining that early stopping can improve generative quality.
Together, our results offer a theoretical foundation for understanding how the
latent dimension influences the sample quality, and highlight stopping time as
a key hyperparameter in LDMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve methods of explaining black-box models by overcoming limitations such as poor scalability, sensitivity to out-of-distribution sampling, and instability under feature correlation.

Method: The authors developed A2D2E, an estimator based on principles of experimental design, specifically leveraging Accelerated Aggregated D-Optimal Designs, to enhance efficiency and robust estimation.

Result: The paper presents theoretical guarantees like convergence and variance reduction, validated the method through simulations, and demonstrated applications in real-world data and language models.

Conclusion: The proposed A2D2E method shows promise at addressing key challenges in explaining black-box models and provides a robust solution validated by theoretical proofs, simulations, and practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in supervised learning have driven growing interest in
explaining black-box models, particularly by estimating the effects of input
variables on model predictions. However, existing approaches often face key
limitations, including poor scalability, sensitivity to out-of-distribution
sampling, and instability under correlated features. To address these issues,
we propose A2D2E, an $\textbf{E}$stimator based on $\textbf{A}$ccelerated
$\textbf{A}$ggregated $\textbf{D}$-Optimal $\textbf{D}$esigns. Our method
leverages principled experimental design to improve efficiency and robustness
in main effect estimation. We establish theoretical guarantees, including
convergence and variance reduction, and validate A2D2E through extensive
simulations. We further provide the potential of the proposed method with a
case study on real data and applications in language models. The code to

*Tassilo Schwarz,Cai Dieball,Constantin Kogler,Kevin Lam,Renaud Lambiotte,Arnaud Doucet,Aljaž Godec,George Deligiannidis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Dyson Diffusion Model using spectral dynamics of matrix diffusion, outperforming prior graph diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models struggle to differentiate certain graph families and depend on ad hoc features, leading to inefficiencies in handling graph data.

Method: The authors leverage random matrix theory to analytically extract spectral properties from the diffusion process and introduce Dyson's Brownian Motion for spectral and non-spectral graph representation.

Result: The Dyson Diffusion Model improves the learning of graph spectra and surpasses current graph diffusion models in performance.

Conclusion: By shifting the inductive bias from the architecture to the dynamics, the Dyson Diffusion Model enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, addressing limitations in traditional graph diffusion methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models are central to generative modeling and have been adapted to
graphs by diffusing adjacency matrix representations. The challenge of having
up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially
mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite
their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to
distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc
features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the
learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to
analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing
us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building
on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian
Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the
adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate
that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms
existing graph diffusion models.

*Jordan Cotler,Clément Hongler,Barbora Hudcová*

Main category: nlin.CG

TL;DR: The paper examines self-replication in physical systems, challenging the idea that Turing-universal systems inherently support this capability. It introduces a Turing-universal cellular automaton incapable of self-replication and explores the computational complexity between physical dynamics and symbolic computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connection between computational universality and the emergence of self-replicating behaviors in physical systems, and to challenge the prevailing hypothesis that Turing-universal systems can inherently enable self-replication.

Method: The authors clarify the meaning of computational universality in physical systems and construct a specific cellular automaton to demonstrate that it is Turing-universal but incapable of non-trivial self-replication. They use mathematical and computational analysis to explore the limits of universality and its link to self-replicating dynamics.

Result: The study shows that Turing-universal computation alone is not sufficient to support self-replication in physical systems. The constructed cellular automaton can perform transcription and translation but cannot instantiate replication.

Conclusion: The findings question the universality of Turing-complete systems in supporting life-like behaviors and establish foundational conditions for self-replicating systems. These results refine our understanding of the computational prerequisites for the emergence of life-like processes.

Abstract: Self-replication is central to all life, and yet how it dynamically emerges
in physical, non-equilibrium systems remains poorly understood. Von Neumann's
pioneering work in the 1940s and subsequent developments suggest a natural
hypothesis: that any physical system capable of Turing-universal computation
can support self-replicating objects. In this work, we challenge this
hypothesis by clarifying what computational universality means for physical
systems and constructing a cellular automaton that is Turing-universal but
cannot sustain non-trivial self-replication. By analogy with biology, such
dynamics manifest transcription and translation but cannot instantiate
replication. More broadly, our work emphasizes that the computational
complexity of translating between physical dynamics and symbolic computation is
inseparable from any claim of universality (exemplified by our analysis of Rule
110) and builds mathematical foundations for identifying self-replicating
behavior. Our approach enables the formulation of necessary dynamical and
computational conditions for a physical system to constitute a living organism.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized blockchain management mechanism using digital twins to balance control and decentralization, ensuring efficient decision-making and reconfiguration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the trade-off between decentralization and control in blockchain governance and dynamic management.

Method: Using multiple digital twins controlled by stakeholders within a secondary blockchain, ensuring decentralized agreement and decision propagation to the managed blockchain.

Result: Simulation results showcase quick consensus on decisions and low overhead in reconfiguring the primary blockchain.

Conclusion: The mechanism effectively manages blockchains dynamically and decentralizedly, resolving the trade-off issue between control and decentralization.

Abstract: The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current
solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off
between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes
a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital
twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple
digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate
decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary
blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions
to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems
without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and
impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted
through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to
reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain
with minimal overhead.

*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PATCH, a method to directly identify and edit circuits in language models responsible for personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, achieving a better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods like differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of language models unintentionally memorizing and leaking personally identifiable information during inference, for which existing defenses like differential privacy cause significant utility loss.

Method: PATCH uses circuit discovery to identify computational circuits responsible for PII leakage in LMs and then directly edits these circuits to reduce leakage, while preserving model utility.

Result: PATCH reduces PII leakage recall by up to 65%, and achieves residual leakage recall as low as 0.01% when combined with differential privacy.

Conclusion: PATCH outperforms existing defense mechanisms in mitigating PII leakage circuits and offers a more efficient privacy-utility trade-off solution for language models.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models' reasoning abilities improve performance but introduce security risks like reasoning-based backdoor attacks.

Method: The paper proposes a unified taxonomy categorizing reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active frameworks, analyzes mechanisms, and suggests defense strategies.

Result: The taxonomy and categorization clarify different approaches, while defense strategies and unresolved challenges highlight areas of concern and research gaps.

Conclusion: This work is a foundational study for understanding and mitigating reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs, fostering a secure research community.

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models
(LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves
LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks,
as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks.
Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive
overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting
LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward
providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by
analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and
unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a
unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing
reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also
present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges
alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel
perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy
LLM communities.

TL;DR: The paper examines vulnerabilities in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for mobile agents, introducing a stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack leveraging in-app prompt injections to compromise UI security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored vulnerabilities of LVLM-powered autonomous mobile agents to subtle UI-level attacks, which pose a significant security risk.

Method: Proposes a jailbreak attack leveraging in-app prompt injections with three components: low-privilege perception-chain targeting, user-invisible activation, and one-shot prompt efficacy using a heuristic-guided search algorithm.

Result: The attack shows high success rates in planning and execution hijacking across multiple LVLM backends in Android apps, with up to 82.5% and 75.0% rates for GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The research highlights critical vulnerabilities in LVLM-powered agents, calling for immediate attention to safeguard autonomous smartphone operations from UI-level attacks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,
keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate
across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we
observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios
(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a
fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate
implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

Motivation: To address concerns over data privacy and model confidentiality in fields like healthcare and finance by enabling secure inference without revealing sensitive data or proprietary models.

Method: Implemented a two-layer neural network using the CKKS scheme for FHE and TinyGarble2.0 for GC. Evaluated under a semi-honest model based on metrics like error, execution time, memory usage, and communication overhead.

Result: Modular GC showed faster execution and lower memory usage, while FHE enabled non-interactive inference.

Conclusion: There are trade-offs between the evaluated approaches: GC excels in efficiency, whereas FHE offers advantages in non-interactivity, highlighting application-specific suitability.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is making its way into fields such as healthcare,
finance, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and concerns over data privacy

(PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without

techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work
presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network
inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS
scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework
(GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest
threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory
usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a
trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption,
while FHE supports non-interactive inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on the insecure ADS-B protocol in air traffic management necessitates robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard against tampered messages and ensure situational awareness.

Method: The researchers created two IDS models: one based on a transformer encoder and the other using an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM). A transfer learning approach was employed, involving pre-training on benign messages and fine-tuning with tampered message datasets.

Result: The xLSTM-based IDS achieved an impressive F1-score of 98.9%, significantly outperforming the transformer-based model (F1-score of 94.3%). It demonstrated strong capabilities in detecting subtle and unseen attacks but introduced a higher latency of 7.26 seconds, compared to the transformer's 2.1 seconds.

Conclusion: xLSTM-based IDS provides heightened accuracy and generalization for ADS-B intrusion detection, proving effective even for subtle threats, though its latency may limit applicability in time-critical scenarios.

Abstract: With the growing reliance on the vulnerable Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol in air traffic management (ATM),
ensuring security is critical. This study investigates emerging machine
learning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two
deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the
other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first
xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving
pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data
containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach
outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that
progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an
F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on
unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.
Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the
xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh
interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.
While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at
the cost of lower detection performance.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper explores the behavior of the randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm for noisy and inconsistent linear systems, providing theoretical insights and validating them with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications often involve noisy and inconsistent systems, yet the RK algorithm's behavior under such conditions is not fully understood.

Method: The paper studies the asymptotic behavior of RK iterates, analyzing the roles of singular vectors, deriving convergence horizon bounds, and conducting numerical experiments.

Result: It reveals the impact of noise levels and system characteristics on convergence, showing theoretical insights into RK's behavior and validating them through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of RK algorithm's limitations and robustness in noisy environments, enabling more effective use in real-world applications.

Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm is one of the most computationally and
memory-efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems.
However, practical applications often involve noisy and potentially
inconsistent systems. While the convergence of RK is well understood for
consistent systems, the study of RK on noisy, inconsistent linear systems is
limited. This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of RK iterates in
expectation when solving noisy and inconsistent systems, addressing the
locations of their limit points. We explore the roles of singular vectors of
the (noisy) coefficient matrix and derive bounds on the convergence horizon,
which depend on the noise levels and system characteristics. Finally, we
provide extensive numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings,
offering practical insights into the algorithm's performance under realistic
conditions. These results establish a deeper understanding of the RK
algorithm's limitations and robustness in noisy environments, paving the way
for optimized applications in real-world scientific and engineering problems.

*Yifan Chen,Sifan Liu*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve mean-field variational inference (MFVI) via a rotated coordinate system, enhancing accuracy without significant computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard MFVI in handling correlations between variables and improving approximation accuracy in probabilistic inference.

Method: The approach uses PCA on a target's score function cross-covariance matrix to define a rotated coordinate system, iteratively transforming the target closer to Gaussian using computationally efficient MFVI subproblems.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher accuracy in Bayesian inference tasks compared to standard MFVI, while being computationally cheaper than normalizing flows.

Conclusion: MFVI in a rotated coordinate system provides an efficient alternative to conventional methods, yielding accurate and computationally light transformations that ease inference tasks.

Abstract: We propose to perform mean-field variational inference (MFVI) in a rotated
coordinate system that reduces correlations between variables. The rotation is
determined by principal component analysis (PCA) of a cross-covariance matrix
involving the target's score function. Compared with standard MFVI along the
original axes, MFVI in this rotated system often yields substantially more
accurate approximations with negligible additional cost.
  MFVI in a rotated coordinate system defines a rotation and a coordinatewise
map that together move the target closer to Gaussian. Iterating this procedure
yields a sequence of transformations that progressively transforms the target
toward Gaussian. The resulting algorithm provides a computationally efficient
way to construct flow-like transport maps: it requires only MFVI subproblems,
avoids large-scale optimization, and yields transformations that are easy to
invert and evaluate. In Bayesian inference tasks, we demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves higher accuracy than standard MFVI, while maintaining
much lower computational cost than conventional normalizing flows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGUANA, a Mixed Reality (MR)-based control system for UAVs, featuring advanced interfaces for high-level and low-level control, situational awareness enhancement, and improved usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies to create more intuitive and immersive control systems.

Method: IGUANA is developed integrating three interfaces: a 3D terrain map, a virtual ball for control, and a spatial overlay to track UAV visibility. A user study was conducted for evaluation.

Result: The study revealed that the 3D map is intuitive with lower perceived workload, the virtual ball interface is useful but limited without physical feedback, and the spatial overlay significantly enhances situational awareness.

Conclusion: IGUANA provides promising upgrades to conventional UAV control systems, offering better usability and awareness, though improvements for physical control feedback are needed.

Abstract: As the markets for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mixed reality (MR)
headsets continue to grow, recent research has increasingly explored their
integration, which enables more intuitive, immersive, and situationally aware
control systems. We present IGUANA, an MR-based immersive guidance, navigation,
and control system for consumer UAVs. IGUANA introduces three key elements
beyond conventional control interfaces: (1) a 3D terrain map interface with
draggable waypoint markers and live camera preview for high-level control, (2)
a novel spatial control metaphor that uses a virtual ball as a physical analogy
for low-level control, and (3) a spatial overlay that helps track the UAV when
it is not visible with the naked eye or visual line of sight is interrupted. We
conducted a user study to evaluate our design, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, and found that (1) the 3D map interface is intuitive and easy to
use, relieving users from manual control and suggesting improved accuracy and
consistency with lower perceived workload relative to conventional dual-stick
controller, (2) the virtual ball interface is intuitive but limited by the lack
of physical feedback, and (3) the spatial overlay is very useful in enhancing
the users' situational awareness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions, including empirical and textual data, to explore human-SAV communication and its implications for user experience and acceptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interactions between humans and Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), which are expected to play a key role in future transportation systems.

Method: The study compiles an open-source dataset with 2,136 interactions between humans and SAVs. It employs random forest modeling and sentiment analysis using both LLM and lexicon-based tools to extract insights and establish benchmarks.

Result: The study finds that conversational sentiment, particularly positivity, significantly influences SAV acceptance and perceived service quality. LLM-based sentiment analysis is found to better align with user-reported sentiment compared to traditional TextBlob methods.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings provide a foundation for enhancing SAV conversational interfaces, facilitating better sentiment modeling, and enabling adaptive, multimodal user interactions.

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

Motivation: To address the inadequacy of traditional knowledge work models in the age of generative AI and explore Human-GenAI collaborative frameworks.

Method: Socio-technical perspective analysis, conceptual framework of KS competencies, and a practice-based vignette to illustrate KS in action.

Result: The KS framework was established with competencies like architecting a vision, dialogue, sculpting information, and synthesis, showcasing practical application.

Conclusion: KS enables effective Human-GenAI collaboration, presenting a transformative approach for trustworthy and actionable knowledge creation.

Abstract: In the Generative Age, the nature of knowledge work is transforming.
Traditional models that emphasise the organisation and retrieval of

synthesis. A practice-based vignette illustrates the KS role in action, and in
a self-referential approach, the paper itself serves as an artefact of the

*Emilio Estevan,María Sierra-Torralba,Eduardo López-Larraz,Luis Montesano*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques for sleep staging using wearable EEG devices, showing they outperform supervised methods in label-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of scalability in analyzing unlabeled sleep data from wearable EEG devices and to reduce the dependency on large annotated datasets for sleep scoring.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of various SSL methods on two datasets (BOAS and HOGAR) using wearable EEG recordings, assessing label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization.

Result: SSL methods improve classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines and achieve over 80% accuracy with only 5%-10% labeled data; they are also robust across different recording conditions and demographics.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising solution for label-efficient and scalable sleep staging, paving the way for accessible and affordable sleep monitoring.

Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to
polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread
adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that
cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of
deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap,
leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation
effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for
sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established
SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon
Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and
wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of
home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios
are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and
cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves
classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains
particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade
accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the
supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL
representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics,
recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG,
reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of
affordable sleep monitoring systems.

TL;DR: The paper studies how human decision-makers' mental models evolve through their interaction with AI systems and proposes a socio-technical framework to guide effective human-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in research regarding the evolution of human decision-makers' mental models when working with AI systems, as previous studies largely focus on the AI agent or collaboration setup.

Method: The authors propose a socio-technical framework identifying three mechanisms—data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback—that influence the evolution of human mental models in human-AI collaboration.

Result: The paper identifies three complementary mental models necessary for human-AI collaboration: domain models, information processing models, and complementarity-awareness models. It also highlights how these models evolve dynamically.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of human-AI collaboration by emphasizing the dynamic nature of mental models and offering mechanisms for designing better collaborations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making
and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the
focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the
collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be
"fixed". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental
models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper
addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration
influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental
models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated
socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental
model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and
performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature
through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models
(domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the
dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the
purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.

### [485] [Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07343)
*Shaorong Zhang,Rob Brekelmans,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), combining optimization-based methods and Bayesian posterior sampling to address inverse problems with superior accuracy and probabilistic grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to bridge the gap between Bayesian sampling methods like Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and optimization-based solvers in inverse problems. While DPS provides principled Bayesian approaches, optimization methods often yield better reconstructions but lack probabilistic interpretability.

Method: LMAPS iteratively solves local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. It offers algorithms with probabilistic covariance approximation, reformulated objectives for stability, and gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators.

Result: LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art results in image restoration tasks such as motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and inverse scattering, offering up to 2 dB improvements over previous methods.

Conclusion: LMAPS successfully combines probabilistically interpretable frameworks with optimization strategies, advancing performance and providing a unified understanding of inverse problem-solving techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability
and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable
operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on
inverse scattering benchmarks.

TL;DR: SViM3D is a framework using video diffusion models to predict consistent multi-view PBR materials from a single image, enabling high-quality relighting and 3D asset generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality 3D assets from single images remains challenging due to limitations in reconstructing reflectance properties for relighting and controlled edits.

Method: The framework extends a video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals with explicit camera control, implementing various quality-improving mechanisms.

Result: SViM3D achieves state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance, generalizing across diverse object-centered datasets.

Conclusion: The method proves valuable for generating relightable 3D assets applicable in AR/VR, movies, games, and other visual media.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural fields are powerful for representing continuous visual signals but are often limited to operating at fixed resolutions, which restricts their flexibility and practicality in various applications.

Method: The method scales Fourier feature embeddings analytically to match the filter's frequency response for convolutional filtering. It also generalizes to unseen parametric filters such as Box and Lanczos and employs single-sample Monte Carlo estimates during training.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates faster training and inference, compatibility with standard network architectures, and superior quantitative and qualitative filtering performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances neural-field filtering capabilities while maintaining efficiency and flexibility, making it a valuable advancement in the field.

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces "splattable neural primitives," a novel method for efficiently representing and rendering 3D scenes by combining neural radiance fields' expressivity with primitive-based splatting's efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to harmonize the trade-off between the expressivity of neural radiance fields and the efficiency of primitive-based splatting methods for rendering 3D scenes.

Method: The proposed method uses volumetric primitives encoded with shallow neural networks and offers analytical solutions for line integrals to eliminate costly ray marching during rendering.

Result: The approach achieves novel-view synthesis quality comparable to 3D Gaussian Splatting while using significantly fewer primitives ($10×$) and parameters ($6×$).

Conclusion: This representation provides an efficient and effective solution for modeling 3D scenes without relying on complex adaptation techniques, making it both practical and performant.

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in personalized image generation, such as high computational expenses in optimization-based methods and entangled representations in learning-based approaches.

Method: SpotDiff utilizes a pre-trained CLIP image encoder along with expert networks dedicated to pose and background. It imposes orthogonality constraints to disentangle subject-specific features from interference.

Result: SpotDiff demonstrates enhanced subject preservation and controllable editing capabilities, with competitive results achieved using only 10k training samples.

Conclusion: SpotDiff advances efficient, robust personalized image generation by disentangling subject-specific features through orthogonality constraints.

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: X2Video introduces a groundbreaking diffusion model for creating photorealistic videos using intrinsic channel guidance (e.g., albedo, normal, etc.) while enabling controls via text prompts and reference images for intuitive editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating high-quality, temporally consistent, photorealistic videos that allow detailed and intuitive editing of intrinsic properties (color, material, geometry, lighting) while accommodating multi-modal controls like text and image input.

Method: X2Video extends the image generation capabilities of XRGB to videos through innovations like Hybrid Self-Attention for temporal consistency, Masked Cross-Attention for disentangling local/global prompts, and Recursive Sampling to generate long videos effectively. It uses a dedicated dataset named InteriorVideo for training.

Result: X2Video produces long, temporally consistent, photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions. The model is versatile, accommodating multi-modal controls for precise editing and adjustments based on reference images and global/local text prompts.

Conclusion: X2Video establishes a new benchmark in video generation by integrating intrinsic guidance, multi-modal controls, and techniques ensuring temporal consistency for extended video creation. Its capabilities are demonstrated through rigorous qualitative and quantitative tests.

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

*Xianghong Xu,Rong Kang,Xiao He,Lei Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Tieying Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZeroCard, a method for cardinality estimation in databases that relies on schema semantics rather than raw data or query logs, enabling practical and scalable application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cardinality estimation methods depend heavily on raw data or query logs, impairing their adaptability and usability in diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose ZeroCard, which predicts data distributions using schema semantics, adopts a query template-agnostic representation, and employs pretraining on a large-scale query dataset to learn cardinality without retraining.

Result: Experiments show ZeroCard's advantages in practical applications like query optimization, highlighting its ability to operate without raw data or query-dependent retraining.

Conclusion: ZeroCard's zero-dependence approach facilitates its deployment in real-world database systems and showcases strong potential for enhancing query optimization performance.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [492] [Implementing Semantic Join Operators Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08489)
*Immanuel Trummer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for semantic joins using LLMs is introduced, replacing nested loop methods with a batched row approach for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance efficiency in semantic query engines using LLMs for semantic joins, addressing costly processing methods.

Method: Batches rows from input tables into a single LLM prompt, leveraging formulas to optimize batch sizes based on LLM constraints.

Result: The method shows reduced processing costs and better performance compared to current approaches, supported by formal and empirical analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed batch-based algorithm is an effective solution for optimizing semantic join operations in LLM-powered query engines.

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.

*Javier Meza-Arroyo,Benius Dunn,Weijie Xu,Yu-Chieh Chen,Jen-Sue Chen,Julia W. P. Hsu*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a machine learning-based method to optimize the encoding fidelity of hardware for time-series data using physical reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of time-series encoding in physical reservoir computing by overcoming limitations caused by suboptimal reservoir operation conditions.

Method: This study employs Bayesian optimization and the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) metric to optimize pulse parameters in solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors for high-fidelity temporal encoding.

Result: The research achieved high-fidelity 6-bit encoding, validated by using optimized pulse parameters. A model trained on 4-bit data effectively guided 6-bit tasks, reducing experimental costs. Key influential parameters were identified using SHAP analysis.

Conclusion: The work proposes a systematic machine learning methodology for optimizing operational conditions in hardware-based reservoir devices, paving the way for similar approaches in other material platforms.

Abstract: Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware,
physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode
time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding
critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is
often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation
conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian
optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed
Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal
encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree
of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally,
we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide
optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost.
Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of
a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is
more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the
4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit
optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the
most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work
presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions
for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical
reservoir implementations across different material platforms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces pyGinkgo, a Python interface for the Ginkgo library, which offers high-performance sparse linear algebra support and demonstrates performance advantages over existing Python libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of high-performance sparse linear algebra support in Python for modern CPU and GPU architectures, which are essential for scientific computing and machine learning.

Method: The authors developed pyGinkgo utilizing Pybind11 to interface with the Ginkgo library, ensuring compatibility with NumPy and PyTorch. Benchmarking is conducted against existing libraries like SciPy, CuPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

Result: pyGinkgo achieves better performance in sparse operations (SpMV product and iterative solvers) compared to state-of-the-art Python libraries, and matches the performance of Ginkgo's native C++ implementation.

Conclusion: pyGinkgo provides a Pythonic yet high-performance solution for sparse linear algebra with platform portability, making it suitable for machine learning and scientific applications.

Abstract: Sparse linear algebra is a cornerstone of many scientific computing and
machine learning applications. Python has become a popular choice for these
applications due to its simplicity and ease of use. Yet high performance sparse
kernels in Python remain limited in functionality, especially on modern CPU and
GPU architectures. We present pyGinkgo, a lightweight and Pythonic interface to
the Ginkgo library, offering high-performance sparse linear algebra support
with platform portability across CUDA, HIP, and OpenMP backends. pyGinkgo
bridges the gap between high-performance C++ backends and Python usability by
exposing Ginkgo's capabilities via Pybind11 and a NumPy and PyTorch compatible
interface. We benchmark pyGinkgo's performance against state-of-the-art Python
libraries including SciPy, CuPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Results across
hardware from different vendors demonstrate that pyGinkgo consistently
outperforms existing Python tools in both sparse matrix vector (SpMV) product
and iterative solver performance, while maintaining performance parity with
native Ginkgo C++ code. Our work positions pyGinkgo as a compelling backend for
sparse machine learning models and scientific workflows.

*Saeideh Bakhshi,Phuong Mai Nguyen,Robert Schiller,Tiantian Xu,Pawan Kodandapani,Andrew Levine,Cayman Simpson,Qifan Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Retentive Relevance,' a survey-based measure to predict long-term user retention, outperforming traditional engagement signals and improving platform user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendation systems overly depend on short-term engagement metrics (like clicks), which fail to effectively capture long-term user satisfaction and retention.

Method: The authors introduced and validated 'Retentive Relevance,' a feedback measure based on psychometric methods, using both offline modeling and large-scale A/B experiments for implementation and testing.

Result: The novel measure outperformed traditional engagement metrics and other survey measures, particularly for new or low-interaction users, showing improved next-day retention and calibrated score adjustments.

Conclusion: Retentive Relevance is a scalable, user-focused metric with demonstrated benefits for both user experience and platform growth, offering implications for responsible AI practices in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of unauthorized data appropriation in Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by proposing an intellectual property protection framework with a novel dataset and a dual-layered watermarking system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RAG enhances LLMs by reducing hallucinations and outdated information, it raises concerns over large-scale unauthorized data use, necessitating effective intellectual property protection.

Method: The authors introduce RPD, a specialized dataset for plagiarism detection, and design a dual-layer watermarking system with semantic and lexical embedding, paired with an interrogator-detective framework using statistical hypothesis testing.

Result: Experiments confirm the presented approach's robustness against diverse scenarios, such as varying query volumes, defense prompts, retrieval settings, and adversarial evasion.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques contribute a crucial foundation for securing intellectual property in RAG-based AI systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously
facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual
property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework, to enhance query-product relevance prediction for Taobao Search by addressing limitations in existing methods through rule-aware reward shaping and adaptive guided replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve LLM-based query-product relevance prediction in e-commerce search, particularly for complex, long-tail cases, due to limitations of current supervised and reinforcement learning methods.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping for dense relevance rewards and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay to correct low-accuracy rollouts during training.

Result: TaoSR-AGRL outperforms DPO and GRPO in offline experiments, showing better relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability, and deployed successfully for Taobao, reaching millions of users.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL addresses the challenges in LLM-based relevance prediction, providing a robust solution with significant practical impact in large-scale real-world applications.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

*Daniel Huwiler,Kurt Stockinger,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VersionRAG is a new framework designed to handle version changes in documents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems fail when dealing with evolving versions of documents, particularly in maintaining temporal validity. This creates challenges in answering version-sensitive questions accurately.

Method: The paper introduces VersionRAG, which uses a hierarchical graph to model document evolution and employs intent classification to choose paths for precise version-aware query routing.

Result: VersionRAG achieved 90% accuracy on the benchmark dataset VersionQA, outperforming existing methods. It also demonstrated strong capabilities in detecting undocumented changes and used fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: Versioned document QA is established as a unique task. VersionRAG provides a robust solution and sets a new benchmark, making it suitable for large-scale, practical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Motivation: To address challenges in reasoning-intensive document retrieval that existing text embedding models struggle with, particularly the creation of high-quality training datasets and effectively capturing semantic relationships.

Method: The authors proposed three innovations: ReMixer, a robust data synthesis method; Redapter, an adaptive learning algorithm; and tested ReasonEmbed across various model sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Result: ReasonEmbed achieved a new record for nDCG@10 score (38.1) on the BRIGHT benchmark, surpassing existing models for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: ReasonEmbed is a significant contribution to document retrieval models, combining novel techniques in data synthesis and learning. Its open-sourcing is expected to accelerate research in this field.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully
open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research
advancement in this field.

Motivation: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to significantly improve recommendation system performance through their sequence modeling capabilities and inherent world knowledge.

Method: The approach involves creating PLUM, which includes item tokenization with Semantic IDs, continued pre-training on domain-specific data, and task-specific fine-tuning for generative retrieval tasks.

Result: PLUM outperforms a highly-optimized production model in retrieval tasks, with detailed findings from internal video recommendation datasets and scaling studies.

Conclusion: PLUM demonstrates the feasibility of adapting LLMs for industry-scale recommendations, showcasing improvements in retrieval and providing insights for launching scalable frameworks to billions of users.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to correct for biases in pseudo-labeled Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in unseen domains or accents, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of systematic accent-specific errors in pseudo-labeling for ASR models, particularly in scenarios with domain shifts and limited ground truth data.

Method: Propose a parameter-space correction using weight differences between ASR models trained on ground-truth and pseudo-labels to form a correction vector. This is applied to pseudo-labeled models to reduce bias.

Result: The method achieved up to a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction in experiments on African accents using the Whisper tiny model.

Conclusion: The proposed parameter-space correction effectively mitigates pseudo-labeling biases in ASR under domain shifts, showing its practical utility in improving recognition for diverse accents.

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for fair compensation and attribution in AI-generated music by introducing direct and verifiable attribution systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing concern that AI-generated music dilutes royalty pools and reveals flaws in current artist compensation frameworks, highlighting the inadequacies of existing solutions like licensing agreements and data attribution mechanisms.

Method: The research distinguishes between training and inference datasets and proposes two types of attribution—training-time and inference-time—with a focus on inference-time attribution to ensure direct, verifiable compensation. It also incorporates user control over song conditioning and transparent attribution mechanisms.

Result: The framework provides an equitable structure for compensating artists and rights holders whenever their music is used in conditioning generative outputs, while also making the attribution process transparent to users.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable, ethical, and practical solution to ensure fairness and provenance in AI-generated music systems, addressing a pressing issue in the music industry.

Abstract: The rise of AI-generated music is diluting royalty pools and revealing
structural flaws in existing remuneration frameworks, challenging the
well-established artist compensation systems in the music industry. Existing
compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack
scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms
provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This
paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on
direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for
artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training
set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms
of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We
here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable
compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated
output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on
specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and
permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the
pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated
music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of
generative systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses the critical issue of 'Insertion Hallucination' in Video-to-Audio models, introduces evaluation metrics to measure this issue, and proposes a novel inference-time method called Posterior Feature Correction (PFC) to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-to-Audio generation methods fail to detect misleading acoustic events known as 'Insertion Hallucinations,' driven by dataset biases such as off-screen sounds. This undermines the reliability of synthesized audio.

Method: The authors designed an ensemble-based evaluation framework, defined two metrics (IH@vid and IH@dur), and proposed an inference-time method, Posterior Feature Correction (PFC), using a two-pass approach to mask hallucinating video features.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art models suffer from severe insertion hallucination, which PFC mitigates by over 50% in both prevalence and duration while maintaining or improving audio quality and synchronization.

Conclusion: This work formally defines and tackles Insertion Hallucination, offering tools and methodologies that enhance the reliability of Video-to-Audio generation models.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically
synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus
on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models
often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no
corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination
and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the
prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current
metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation
framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event
detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and
severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and
IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose
Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that
mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial
audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio
after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments
on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models
suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence
and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and
in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and
temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,
systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,
paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.

limited reproducibility and inconsistent baselines. In this work, we introduce
WEALY, a fully reproducible pipeline that leverages Whisper decoder embeddings
for lyrics matching tasks. WEALY establishes robust and transparent baselines,
while also exploring multimodal extensions that integrate textual and acoustic
features. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate
that WEALY achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that
lack reproducibility. In addition, we provide ablation studies and analyses on
language robustness, loss functions, and embedding strategies. This work
contributes a reliable benchmark for future research, and underscores the
potential of speech technologies for music information retrieval tasks.

### [506] [Minimizing the Value-at-Risk of Loan Portfolio via Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07444)
*Albert Di Wang,Ye Du*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper addresses risk management in peer-to-peer lending, proposing DeNN and DSNN models to forecast loan defaults and reduce portfolio risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve risk management in peer-to-peer lending by minimizing portfolio risks using advanced modeling techniques.

Method: Development of DeNN (low degree of freedom deep neural network) and DSNN (high degree of freedom model) to predict loan defaults and default timing.

Result: Both DeNN and DSNN significantly reduce portfolio Value-at-Risks at various confidence levels, with DeNN showing better performance in most scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed models offer effective solutions for risk management in peer-to-peer lending, with DeNN being particularly advantageous in reducing portfolio risks.

Abstract: Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may
naturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his
money on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the
Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio.
We propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as
a high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem. In particular, our
models predict not only the default probability of a loan but also the time
when it will default. The experiments demonstrate that both models can
significantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels,
compared to benchmarks. More interestingly, the low degree of freedom model,
DeNN, outperforms DSNN in most scenarios.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modular architecture to streamline quantum computing benchmarking by decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into interoperable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented quantum computing benchmarking landscape by promoting interoperability and standardization.

Method: The authors utilized modular interfaces to integrate various benchmarking frameworks (e.g., CUDA-Q, pyGSTi), enabling dynamic extension and cross-platform compatibility.

Result: Successful integration with multiple tools and demonstration of extensibility by introducing new benchmarks like dynamic circuits and quantum reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Standardized modular interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation, enhance benchmarking flexibility, and improve compatibility in the quantum computing domain.

Abstract: We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the
increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by
decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into
independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants
ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex
Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with
multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse
workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with
Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for
multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by
implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum
reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across
multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying
and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between
incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized
interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization
flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the
continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for
Quantum Computing suite.

*David Layden,Ryan Sweke,Vojtěch Havlíček,Anirban Chowdhury,Kirill Neklyudov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper establishes a connection between flow models in machine learning and the Schrödinger equation, enabling an efficient quantum algorithm for sampling complex distributions using qsamples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the intersection of modern machine learning generative models, specifically flow models, and quantum computing capabilities, with the goal of leveraging quantum dynamics to enhance classical machine learning tasks.

Method: The authors demonstrate a formal relationship between flow models and the Schrödinger equation and provide a proof that the associated Hamiltonian dynamics can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer. This allows for coherent encoding of distributions via quantum methods.

Result: The paper provides a quantum algorithm capable of generating qsamples for distributions modeled by flow models, facilitating the application of advanced quantum statistical algorithms to classical machine learning problems.

Conclusion: The findings establish a significant link between advanced machine learning techniques and quantum computing, suggesting potential advantages in statistical problem-solving and quantum simulation for tasks associated with flow models.

Abstract: Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative
models that progressively transform probability distributions according to
learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process
that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples
from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally
related to the Schr\"odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous
variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian
can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results
give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples)
for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by
flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem,
plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models,
such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum
algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical
algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results
reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models,
such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected
capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.

### [509] [Quantum Grid Path Planning Using Parallel QAOA Circuits Based on Minimum Energy Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07413)
*Jun Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum path planning solution using parallel Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits to address challenges faced in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and classical path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current classical path planning struggles with NP problems, while existing quantum path planning is restricted by limitations of the NISQ era.

Method: A novel approach maps grid path planning to finding the minimum quantum energy state using two parallel QAOA circuits for connectivity and path energy calculations, coupled with a classical filter for optimization.

Result: Through the use of a filtering mechanism and parallel circuits, the approach increases the likelihood of achieving the target quantum state and outperforms serial circuits in finding optimal solutions.

Conclusion: Parallel QAOA circuits provide an efficient and effective method to solve quantum path planning problems, showcasing potential advantages in low-layer quantum circuits by leveraging filtering solutions.

Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP
problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path
planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this
study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically,
the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum
quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously
execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path
energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out
unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate
optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the
calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings
indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states
corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities
can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of
obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is
only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can
still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with
serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can
find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the use of quantum agents to autonomously discover quantum algorithms and strategies without prior knowledge, addressing the challenge of automated design in quantum computing.

Method: Quantum agents were trained using episodic, reward-based reinforcement learning to achieve efficient solutions for various quantum tasks and games.

Result: The agents autonomously rediscovered seminal quantum algorithms like Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's search, and strategies for protocols such as CHSH winning strategies—all without prior access to optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of quantum intelligence for automated algorithmic discovery, paving the way for innovative and independent quantum design.

Abstract: We introduce quantum agents trained by episodic, reward-based reinforcement
learning to autonomously rediscover several seminal quantum algorithms and
protocols. In particular, our agents learn: efficient logarithmic-depth quantum
circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform; Grover's search algorithm; optimal
cheating strategies for strong coin flipping; and optimal winning strategies
for the CHSH and other nonlocal games. The agents achieve these results
directly through interaction, without prior access to known optimal solutions.
This demonstrates the potential of quantum intelligence as a tool for
algorithmic discovery, opening the way for the automated design of novel
quantum algorithms and protocols.

*Raisa M. Simoes,Timoteo Kelly,Eduardo J. Simoes,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper investigates which issues influenced voter decisions in the 2024 presidential election through AI-based NLP and clustering analysis of YouTube comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand voter decision-making by analyzing raw user data, rather than relying on traditional polling or surveys.

Method: Two AI-based methods, NLP and clustering, were applied to analyze over 8,000 election-related YouTube comments from the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.

Result: Immigration, democracy, and identity politics were the most discussed issues, while inflation was less referenced. Findings align partially with post-election surveys but contradict the importance of inflation.

Conclusion: Raw user data analysis through opinion mining is a compelling alternative to traditional polling methods for understanding election results and salient voter issues.

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

*Ronja Strömsdörfer,Klaus Obermayer*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: This paper investigates two distinct adaptation mechanisms—spike-frequency adaptation and hyperpolarization-activated currents—in the context of their effects on traveling waves of slow oscillations during slow-wave sleep using a biophysical model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms that modulate the traveling waves of slow oscillations during slow-wave sleep, and to investigate how different neuronal adaptation mechanisms contribute to their spatio-temporal dynamics.

Method: The authors used a spatially extended, two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling. The excitatory populations were equipped with either spike-frequency adaptation or hyperpolarization-activated adaptation mechanisms. The mechanisms' effects were analyzed through equivalence in mathematics and compensatory external input and by varying adaptation strength.

Result: The findings show that strong adaptation is necessary to induce traveling waves. Adaptation strength modulates spatio-temporal activity patterns, including frequencies and wave speed. Despite mathematical equivalence, location-dependent variations in feedback strength generate differences in propagation behavior for each adaptation mechanism.

Conclusion: Although dynamically equivalent under external inputs, the two adaptation mechanisms produce distinct effects on traveling waves of slow oscillations due to location-based feedback variations, providing deeper insights into the modulation of neural dynamics during slow-wave sleep.

Abstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow
oscillations (SOs; $\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of
alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms
that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is
established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One
mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing
feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An
alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which
are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both
adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal
populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable
differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a
spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial
coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two
adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and
include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength
and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent
under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength,
leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation
structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves.
Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal
activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of
the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though
being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent
variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of
traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study tests whether combining curriculum learning and synthetic data with diffusion models improves AI detection of challenging pulmonary nodules in X-rays. Significant gains in accuracy and sensitivity were demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard AI models struggle with detecting tough pulmonary nodules due to imbalanced datasets and limited annotations. This research aims to improve detection rates and robustness.

Method: The researchers used curriculum learning with Faster R-CNN (FPN) trained on a hybrid dataset including expert-labeled radiographs and diffusion-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores guided the curriculum.

Result: The curriculum method delivered superior performance with an AUC of 0.95, higher sensitivity, and accuracy. Grad-CAM verified anatomically coherent attention under curriculum learning.

Conclusion: Integrating curriculum learning with synthetic augmentation boosts robustness and generalization for detecting difficult pulmonary nodules.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

*Yufei Tong,Guanjie Cheng,Peihan Wu,Yicheng Zhu,Kexu Lu,Feiyi Chen,Meng Xi,Junqin Huang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SatFusion, a framework for improving satellite image quality through multi-temporal and multi-source data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for processing Satellite IoT images struggle with effectively integrating information from temporal and source dimensions while dealing with constraints like input texture details, noise sensitivity, and misregistration.

Method: SatFusion incorporates three modules: Multi-Temporal Image Fusion for feature alignment, Multi-Source Image Fusion for texture enhancement, and Fusion Composition for adaptive integration and spectral refinement, using a weighted combination of loss functions.

Result: Experiments on various datasets (WorldStrat, WV3, QB, GF2) show improved fusion quality, robustness in adverse conditions, and better adaptability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Conclusion: SatFusion advances image processing in Satellite IoT settings by overcoming limitations of existing methods, demonstrating practicality and superior performance in diverse applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of
satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the
continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images
across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully
exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source
dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances
reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple
observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images
constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source
images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,
but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes
noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.
To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for
Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.
Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)
module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a
Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture
information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module
adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while
dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination
of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB,
and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion
quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to
real-world Sat-IoT scenarios. The code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI model for generating diagnostic radiology reports for traumatic brain injuries using a combination of AC-BiFPN and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diagnostic challenges and time-critical nature of interpreting medical images related to traumatic brain injuries in emergency scenarios.

Method: The proposed AI model integrates AC-BiFPN for multi-scale feature extraction from CT and MRI scans and a Transformer for generating detailed, contextually relevant diagnostic reports.

Result: Their AI model outperformed traditional CNN models in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation on the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of advanced AI techniques to aid radiologists, improve diagnostic accuracy, provide educational tools, and enhance clinical decision-making in emergency medical settings.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IKNet, an explainable framework for stock prediction that combines semantic analysis of news keywords with financial data, achieving significant accuracy and interpretability improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing news-based forecasting models fail to provide interpretability in showing the specific impacts of public sentiment on stock price prediction.

Method: IKNet leverages FinBERT for identifying relevant keywords, processes each through specific nonlinear layers, integrates them with time-series stock data, and applies Shapley Additive Explanations for interpretability.

Result: Using S&P 500 data (2015–2024), IKNet reduces RMSE by up to 32.9%, improves cumulative returns by 18.5%, and provides better insights into sentiment-driven volatility.

Conclusion: IKNet offers a novel, interpretable solution that surpasses traditional models in accuracy and transparency for forecasting stock prices using public sentiment.

Abstract: The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news
articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets.
Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent
all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the
general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of
the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we
propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an
explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between
individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies
salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding
through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their
representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast
next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model
generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of
each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to
2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural
networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving
cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering
contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SurgiFlowVid, a video diffusion framework to generate surgical videos that address class imbalances in datasets while enhancing model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical video datasets often exhibit class imbalance, limiting robustness in downstream tasks like procedural modeling and intra-operative support.

Method: The approach uses a dual-prediction diffusion module for denoising RGB frames and optical flow, coupled with a sparse visual encoder for controllable generation based on lightweight signals.

Result: Validated across three surgical datasets, the synthetic data improves tasks such as action recognition, tool detection, and motion prediction by 10-20% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SurgiFlowVid effectively mitigates data imbalance, enhances surgical video understanding, and improves downstream model performance, making it a promising tool for such tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling
procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are
often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which
limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with
$SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for
generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach
introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames
and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion
modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions
the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks
or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate
our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action
recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.
Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over
competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to
mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational pipeline to annotate Wuchereria bancrofti's uncharacterized proteins and identify potential drug targets, aiding lymphatic filariasis research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the challenge of functional annotation for Wuchereria bancrofti's largely uncharacterized proteome, which limits effective drug discovery against lymphatic filariasis.

Method: The authors developed a computational workflow using DEtection TRansformer for enzymatic probability estimation, hierarchical EC classification, rejection sampling, and target prioritization across biochemical strategies.

Result: The study annotated EC numbers for 14,772 proteins, identified 543 novel EC classes, prioritized six enzyme targets, and identified multiple compounds with promising binding affinities for drug development.

Conclusion: This work offers a functional map of W. bancrofti's proteome, identifies drug targets, and presents a library of potential compounds, serving as a basis for experimental validation and further drug discovery efforts.

Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic
filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million
at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack
of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark
proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present
a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino
acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and
drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the
probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor
EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling
to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This
pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized
proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A
qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical
tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized
six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall
inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune
interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound
library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein
conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong
predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs
against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing
promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental
validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale
functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage
drug development for the species.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying different signal components in complex signals is a challenging task, and it is crucial for tasks like signal processing and analysis.

Method: The authors reframe the problem of signal identification as a graph clustering problem by treating signal components as subgraphs in a graph structure.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of this graph clustering approach to effectively identify signal components.

Conclusion: Reformulating signal identification as a graph clustering problem provides a novel and promising avenue for signal component separation.

Abstract: We show that the problem of identifying different signal components from a
time-frequency representation can be equivalently phrased as a graph clustering
problem: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ one aims to identify `clusters', subgraphs
that are strongly connected and have relatively few connections between them.
The graph clustering problem is well studied, we show how these ideas can
suggest (many) new ways to identify signal components. Numerical experiments
illustrate the ideas.

### [521] [Attention to Order: Transformers Discover Phase Transitions via Learnability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07401)
*Şener Özönder*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'learnability' as a universal criterion to identify phase transitions using transformer models to analyze ordered and disordered phases, showing enhanced learnability in ordered states and providing unsupervised diagnostics for critical temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable methods for identifying phase transition boundaries are needed in cases where analytic solutions are unavailable and conventional simulations fail.

Method: The study utilizes self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo simulations with transformer models to explore learnability in microscopic states of the two-dimensional Ising model.

Result: Ordered phases showed reduced training loss and structured attention patterns, while disordered phases resisted learning. These metrics also accurately identified critical temperatures of phase transitions.

Conclusion: Learnability, expressed in structured training dynamics of transformer models, is a marker for phase transitions, bridging concepts from condensed matter physics and modern language processing.

Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior,
yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic
solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce
learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer
model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic
states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations
of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to
enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured
attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two
unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in
attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with
the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of
phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in
condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.

*Enrico Ampellio,Blazhe Gjorgiev,Giovanni Sansavini*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-level Kriging-based surrogate modeling approach to optimize complex engineering problems under uncertainty efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering design problems face challenges due to numerous variables, parameters, and uncertainties, creating the need for scalable and precise optimization methods.

Method: A non-intrusive, fast-scaling Kriging-based surrogate is developed, adaptively updated via hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to handle uncertainties efficiently.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher accuracy and faster computation when tested against an analytical testbed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses high-dimensional, complex engineering problems under uncertainty while minimizing computational resources.

Abstract: Engineering design involves demanding models encompassing many decision
variables and uncontrollable parameters. In addition, unavoidable aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties can be very impactful and add further complexity. The
state-of-the-art adopts two steps, uncertainty quantification and design
optimization, to optimize systems under uncertainty by means of robust or
stochastic metrics. However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted,
and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be
affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach
is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and
complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A
non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the
combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are
adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the
fewer and most uncertainty-informed data. The proposed method is statistically
compared to the state-of-the-art via an analytical testbed and is shown to be
concurrently faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude.

*Vamsi Addanki*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for adaptive photonic interconnects to optimize reconfiguration in collective communication, balancing delay and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck in chip-to-chip silicon photonics in scale-up systems caused by collective communication.

Method: Introduced a theoretical framework based on Birkhoff–von Neumann decomposition, maximum concurrent flow, and $
α$-β cost models to optimize photonic interconnect reconfiguration.

Result: The framework clarifies the trade-off between reconfiguration delay and adaptive topology benefits and demonstrates foundational principles connecting network throughput and collective operations.

Conclusion: The framework provides foundational insights for advancing the field and outlines further research directions in algorithm design and system integration for photonic interconnects.

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and
energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical
bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a
promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can
establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints
-- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations}
(e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to
the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between
reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive
photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when
reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not
surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN)
decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network
throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$-$\beta$ cost model for collectives.
Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems
integration that can build on this foundation.

TL;DR: The study proposes BlockSDN, an SDN-based blockchain architecture, reducing global block synchronization time compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain scalability suffers due to inefficient P2P broadcasting, often neglecting physical network factors.

Method: It uses an SDN-based distributed control plane, a graph engine for clustering, and a hybrid hierarchical broadcasting approach.

Result: BlockSDN achieves a 65% reduction in synchronization time compared to Gossip and a 55% improvement over Mercury.

Conclusion: SDN-enabled cross-layer coordination can significantly enhance blockchain performance and scalability.

Abstract: The scalability of blockchain systems is constrained by inefficient P2P
broadcasting, as most existing optimizations focus only on the logical layer
without considering physical network conditions. To address this, we propose
BlockSDN, the first SDN-based integrated architecture for blockchain. BlockSDN
employs a distributed control plane for a global network view, a graph engine
for hierarchical clustering, and a hybrid macro-micro neighbor selection with
hierarchical broadcasting. A dedicated simulation platform shows that BlockSDN
reduces global block synchronization time by 65% and 55% compared to Gossip and
Mercury, respectively.These results highlight the potential of SDN-enabled
cross-layer coordination to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and
performance.

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep generative modeling framework to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations by 10,000 times, allowing detailed analysis of processes previously inaccessible due to computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular dynamics simulations are limited by the need for femtosecond time steps, making it infeasible to study slow conformational and relaxation processes, which are critical for understanding chemical functions.

Method: The authors developed a deep generative modeling framework that accelerates molecular dynamics simulations while preserving physical realism. It generalizes across different chemical compositions and system sizes.

Result: The method quantitatively characterizes equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes for small organic molecules and peptides, including systems larger than those used for model training. It also captures transitions on extended time scales.

Conclusion: This approach enables detailed examination of molecular motions, thermodynamics, and kinetics in chemical and biophysical systems, expanding the scope of molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging
processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional
molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their
femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and
relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep
generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics
by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small
organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative
characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes
that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation.
Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system
size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and
captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By
expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing
atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing
conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to
chemistry and biophysics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEPTv2, an optimized version of the HEPT model, for charged particle track reconstruction in collider experiments, achieving faster inference and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks in charged particle track reconstruction, specifically focusing on improving the throughput of graph-based methods by overcoming limitations such as costly graph construction and inefficient clustering phases.

Method: The authors present HEPTv2, which extends the original HEPT by incorporating a lightweight decoder that removes the need for a separate clustering stage, enabling end-to-end track prediction with efficient hardware-friendly computations.

Result: HEPTv2 achieves an ultra-fast inference speed of approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 GPU, while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency on the TrackML dataset.

Conclusion: HEPTv2 offers a practical and scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for particle tracking, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and hardware adaptability without compromising performance.

Abstract: Charged particle track reconstruction is a foundational task in collider
experiments and the main computational bottleneck in particle reconstruction.
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem,
but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access
patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed
Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically
guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its
evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object
condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step
(e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two
contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking
performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same
dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a
lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts
track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular,
hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference.
On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event
on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results
position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for
fast tracking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of scalability and physical constraints in optical SNNs while achieving realistic implementation through efficient sub-one-laser-per-neuron solutions.

Method: The team introduces SEPhIA, leveraging microring resonator modulators (MRMs) and multi-wavelength sources, validating it through time-domain co-simulations and a physics-informed optoelectronic SNN model.

Result: SEPhIA achieved over 90% classification accuracy on a spike-encoded dataset, demonstrating performance comparable to software SNN models and exploring the impact of photonic device parameters in constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: SEPhIA is a physically grounded, scalable neuromorphic photonic solution that effectively addresses and enhances spike-encoded tasks, bridging theoretical and practical implementation gaps in optical SNNs.

Abstract: Research into optical spiking neural networks (SNNs) has primarily focused on
spiking devices, networks of excitable lasers or numerical modelling of large
architectures, often overlooking key constraints such as limited optical power,
crosstalk and footprint. We introduce SEPhIA, a photonic-electronic,
multi-tiled SNN architecture emphasizing implementation feasibility and
realistic scaling. SEPhIA leverages microring resonator modulators (MRMs) and
multi-wavelength sources to achieve effective sub-one-laser-per-spiking neuron
efficiency. We validate SEPhIA at both device and architecture levels by
time-domain co-simulating excitable CMOS-MRR coupled circuits and by devising a
physics-aware, trainable optoelectronic SNN model, with both approaches
utilizing experimentally derived device parameters. The multi-layer
optoelectronic SNN achieves classification accuracies over 90% on a four-class
spike-encoded dataset, closely comparable to software models. A design space
study further quantifies how photonic device parameters impact SNN performance
under constrained signal-to-noise conditions. SEPhIA offers a scalable,
expressive, physically grounded solution for neuromorphic photonic computing,
capable of addressing spike-encoded tasks.

TL;DR: Deep learning-based MRI analysis of hepatic vessel volumes allows differentiation between healthy and chronic liver disease stages, correlating with traditional disease severity markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify changes in hepatic vessel volumes across different chronic liver disease stages using MRI analysis and investigate their correlations with liver dysfunction and fibrosis biomarkers.

Method: The study used a 3D U-Net model for hepatic vessel segmentation in portal venous phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI scans. It retrospectively analyzed 197 subjects, classified into healthy controls, non-advanced, and advanced liver disease groups.

Result: Hepatic vessel-to-volume ratios were significantly different between the groups, with the highest volumes in healthy controls and the lowest in advanced chronic liver disease patients. Significant correlations were found between vessel metrics and established liver disease biomarkers.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based hepatic vessel metrics can differentiate between disease stages and provide insights into liver disease severity using non-invasive imaging.

Abstract: Background: We aimed to quantify hepatic vessel volumes across chronic liver
disease stages and healthy controls using deep learning-based magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, and assess correlations with biomarkers for
liver (dys)function and fibrosis/portal hypertension.
  Methods: We assessed retrospectively healthy controls, non-advanced and
advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) patients using a 3D U-Net model for
hepatic vessel segmentation on portal venous phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3-T
MRI. Total (TVVR), hepatic (HVVR), and intrahepatic portal vein-to-volume
ratios (PVVR) were compared between groups and correlated with:
albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na)
score, and fibrosis/portal hypertension (Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] score, liver
stiffness measurement [LSM], hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG], platelet
count [PLT], and spleen volume).
  Results: We included 197 subjects, aged 54.9 $\pm$ 13.8 years (mean $\pm$
standard deviation), 111 males (56.3\%): 35 healthy controls, 44 non-ACLD, and
118 ACLD patients. TVVR and HVVR were highest in controls (3.9; 2.1),
intermediate in non-ACLD (2.8; 1.7), and lowest in ACLD patients (2.3; 1.0) ($p
\leq 0.001$). PVVR was reduced in both non-ACLD and ACLD patients (both 1.2)
compared to controls (1.7) ($p \leq 0.001$), but showed no difference between
CLD groups ($p = 0.999$). HVVR significantly correlated indirectly with FIB-4,
ALBI, MELD-Na, LSM, and spleen volume ($\rho$ ranging from -0.27 to -0.40), and
directly with PLT ($\rho = 0.36$). TVVR and PVVR showed similar but weaker
correlations.
  Conclusions: Deep learning-based hepatic vessel volumetry demonstrated
differences between healthy liver and chronic liver disease stages and shows
correlations with established markers of disease severity.

Result: Verification tasks for quantized GNNs are proven computationally intractable (coNEXPTIME-complete). Experimental results show these models maintain accuracy and generalization while being lightweight.

Conclusion: Quantized ACR-GNN models offer benefits in efficiency and performance, but their verification poses significant computational challenges, warranting further exploration of safety measures.

Abstract: We introduce a logical language for reasoning about quantized
aggregate-combine graph neural networks with global readout (ACR-GNNs). We
provide a logical characterization and use it to prove that verification tasks
for quantized GNNs with readout are (co)NEXPTIME-complete. This result implies
that the verification of quantized GNNs is computationally intractable,

Conclusion: FlowLensing provides a scalable and efficient alternative for gravitational lensing simulations, facilitating dark matter research and cosmological surveys.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet
creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing

are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based
compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing
simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes,
handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous
model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable
simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for
probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our
model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve high-dimensional matrix estimation by leveraging rank-adaptive strategies to balance estimation precision and approximation cost.

Method: The authors establish sample complexity bounds, propose a combination of a Least-Squares estimator and a singular value thresholding procedure, and provide finite-sample error bounds.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, closely matching the derived fundamental limits while effectively estimating high-dimensional matrices under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of adaptive rank selection in matrix estimation, with applications validated in multivariate regression and linear dynamical systems.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear
measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These
algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the
corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined
based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample
complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting
the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular
values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our
analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being
estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that
combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding
procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and
demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits.
Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on
singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to
multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modeling the volatile cryptocurrency market, which is influenced by dynamic sentiments and data, beyond the capabilities of traditional static models.

Method: The trading system utilizes LLMs specifically structured into agents for tasks like technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, and decision-making. It introduces a verbal feedback mechanism for adaptive learning through natural-language critiques.

Result: Back-testing over a nine-month period demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to 30% higher returns in bullish markets, turning sideways market losses into 100% gains, and improving overall results by 31% with verbal feedback integration.

Conclusion: The study highlights verbal feedback's potential as a scalable, low-cost method for dynamically tuning LLMs to excel in financial trading and outperform traditional strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large
Language Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the
cryptocurrencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme
volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and
regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static
regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53].
The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised
agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and
performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal
feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly
natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are
then injected into future prompts, allowing the system to adjust indicator
priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates
or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025
shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantitative agent
delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains
versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets
from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further
improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%. The
results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and
low-cost method of tuning LLMs for financial goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression (SR), despite its scientific importance, struggles with large search spaces and model overfitting, making interpretability a challenge.

Method: IdeaSearchFitter uses LLMs as semantic operators within evolutionary algorithms, generating expressions informed by natural-language rationales for improved coherence and accuracy.

Result: The framework shows strong performance on benchmarks like FSReD, handles noisy real-world data, and provides compact parametrizations in high-energy physics.

Conclusion: IdeaSearchFitter effectively combines semantic guidance via LLMs with symbolic regression, addressing challenges in complexity, interpretability, and application noise.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions
from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often
hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to
overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space
syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This
paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language
Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By
generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our
method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also
conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's
efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust
performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming
several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good
accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact,
physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a
frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized

Result: The whisker sensor accurately identifies vortex shedding frequencies (±10% error), transitions to turbulence (via entropy), and achieves 86% classification accuracy in real-time analysis.

Conclusion: The sensor provides a reliable, scalable, and real-time underwater perception system with potential applications in wake tracking and turbulence-aware navigation for marine robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust
hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on
Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with
embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and
frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and
computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively
distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal
scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity
without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon
entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex
shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy
captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and
logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with
millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally
encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for
underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in
autonomous marine robots.

### [536] [Beyond independent component analysis: identifiability and algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07525)
*Alvaro Ribot,Anna Seigal,Piotr Zwiernik*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper extends the classical Independent Component Analysis (ICA) framework by introducing pairwise mean independence for identifiability and proposes an algebraic recovery algorithm for blind source separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the limitations of classical ICA and explore whether relaxing the independence assumption allows for more flexible and stable recovery of latent variables.

Method: The authors establish pairwise mean independence as a new identifiability criterion and present an algebraic recovery algorithm using least-squares optimization over the orthogonal group.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that pairwise mean independence offers robustness, and enforcing strict independence can deteriorate estimation quality.

Conclusion: Pairwise mean independence extends ICA and provides a rigorous basis for stable blind source separation, accommodating relaxed independence assumptions.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a classical method for recovering
latent variables with useful identifiability properties. For independent
variables, cumulant tensors are diagonal; relaxing independence yields tensors
whose zero structure generalizes diagonality. These models have been the
subject of recent work in non-independent component analysis. We show that
pairwise mean independence answers the question of how much one can relax
independence: it is identifiable, any weaker notion is non-identifiable, and it
contains the models previously studied as special cases. Our results apply to
distributions with the required zero pattern at any cumulant tensor. We propose
an algebraic recovery algorithm based on least-squares optimization over the
orthogonal group. Simulations highlight robustness: enforcing full independence
can harm estimation, while pairwise mean independence enables more stable
recovery. These findings extend the classical ICA framework and provide a
rigorous basis for blind source separation beyond independence.

### [537] [Navigating Sparsities in High-Dimensional Linear Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08435)
*Rui Zhao,Zihan Chen,Zemin Zheng*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flexible algorithm, HOPE, that improves performance in high-dimensional linear contextual bandit problems with different types of sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that focus on narrow types of sparsity in high-dimensional contextual bandit problems.

Method: A pointwise estimator was developed to handle different types of sparsity, and was incorporated into a novel algorithm called HOPE.

Result: HOPE demonstrated better regret bounds in homogeneous settings and successfully addressed heterogeneous settings with mixed sparsity types.

Conclusion: HOPE is a flexible and general solution for high-dimensional linear contextual bandits, outperforming current approaches.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear contextual bandit problems remain a significant
challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods typically
consider either the model parameters to be sparse or the eigenvalues of context
covariance matrices to be (approximately) sparse, lacking general applicability
due to the rigidity of conventional reward estimators. To overcome this
limitation, a powerful pointwise estimator is introduced in this work that
adaptively navigates both kinds of sparsity. Based on this pointwise estimator,
a novel algorithm, termed HOPE, is proposed. Theoretical analyses demonstrate
that HOPE not only achieves improved regret bounds in previously discussed
homogeneous settings (i.e., considering only one type of sparsity) but also,
for the first time, efficiently handles two new challenging heterogeneous
settings (i.e., considering a mixture of two types of sparsity), highlighting
its flexibility and generality. Experiments corroborate the superiority of HOPE
over existing methods across various scenarios.

### [538] [Computational and statistical lower bounds for low-rank estimation under general inhomogeneous noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08541)
*Debsurya De,Dmitriy Kunisky*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper investigates the spiked Wigner matrix problem in the context of inhomogeneous noise and computational optimality of spectral algorithms. It generalizes prior results by removing assumptions about the variance profile being block-structured and tightens existing bounds, offering numerical and theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the computational and theoretical limits of spectral algorithms for detecting low-rank signals in inhomogeneous spiked Wigner matrices and to establish whether such algorithms are optimal under broader conditions.

Method: The authors analyze graph sums in matrix computations, introduce sharper bounds for non-negative matrices, and compare spectral algorithms against low-degree polynomial algorithms with both theoretical proofs and numerical studies.

Result: The study demonstrates that the spectral algorithm remains optimal for detecting low-rank signals across a wide range of models, including cases without block-structured variance profiles. It also provides improved lower bounds for certain distributions and supports a computational hardness conjecture.

Conclusion: The paper strengthens the theoretical foundation for using spectral algorithms in inhomogeneous spiked Wigner models, suggesting their broad computational optimality and extending prior results to more general settings and noise profiles.

Abstract: Recent work has generalized several results concerning the well-understood
spiked Wigner matrix model of a low-rank signal matrix corrupted by additive
i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance
profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a
block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm
for detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal
strength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved
information-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions,
match the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the
computational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for
a much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm
cannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial
algorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness
conjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2023). With similar
techniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class
of signal distributions not treated by prior work. Unlike all of the above
results on inhomogeneous models, our results do not assume that the variance
profile has a block structure, and suggest that the same spectral algorithm
might remain optimal for quite general profiles. We include a numerical study
of this claim for an example of a smoothly-varying rather than
piecewise-constant profile. Our proofs involve analyzing the graph sums of a
matrix, which also appear in free and traffic probability, but we require new
bounds on these quantities that are tighter than existing ones for non-negative
matrices, which may be of independent interest.

### [539] [Computations and ML for surjective rational maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08093)
*Ilya Karzhemanov*

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: The paper examines surjective rational endomorphisms on projective plane involving cubic terms, employing Python and Machine Learning for classification, and proves necessary conditions for surjectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to classify surjective rational endomorphisms with indeterminacy loci in projective planes, leveraging computational techniques alongside mathematical proof to advance understanding.

Method: The authors use Python programming and Machine Learning to experimentally classify the maps, and apply projective geometry to derive surjectivity conditions.

Result: New explicit maps are discovered via computational approaches, and it is proven that such cubic endomorphisms are surjective only if the indeterminacy locus has at least three elements.

Conclusion: Both computational tools and pure geometry can successfully explore and characterize mathematical structures, demonstrating their complementary strengths.

Abstract: The present note studies \emph{surjective rational endomorphisms} $f:
\mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$ with \emph{cubic} terms and the
indeterminacy locus $I_f \ne \emptyset$. We develop an experimental approach,
based on some Python programming and Machine Learning, towards the
classification of such maps; a couple of new explicit $f$ is constructed in
this way. We also prove (via pure projective geometry) that a general
non-regular cubic endomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ is surjective if and only
if the set $I_f$ has cardinality at least $3$.
