Under the\nexchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as\na parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an\ninfinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are\nLipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate\n$\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous\nsetting, we prove the same $\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the\nimportant special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in\ndynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel\napproximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive\nDesign (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated\nequilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting\napproximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,\nscalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID.
