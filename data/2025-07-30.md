### [1] [SynLang and Symbiotic Epistemology: A Manifesto for Conscious Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21067)
*Jan Kapusta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Symbiotic Epistemology and SynLang, a protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration, focusing on calibrated trust and dual-level transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of opaque reasoning in AI systems and establish genuine human-AI collaboration based on transparent and structured reasoning.

Method: Introducing SynLang and TRACE mechanisms for reasoning patterns and explanations, along with confidence quantification and declarative control for structured AI behavior.

Result: Empirical validation showed AI successfully adapted to structured reasoning protocols, facilitating metacognitive interventions and strengthened collaboration.

Conclusion: The framework enables AI systems to augment human intelligence, preserve agency, and ensure ethical accountability through structured communication and transparency.

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

### [3] [Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Synthea Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21123)
*Mark A. Kramer,Aanchal Mathur,Caroline E. Adams,Jason A. Walonoski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines using large language models (LLMs) to aid in creating disease modules for Synthea, aiming to improve quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency, diversity, and quality of synthetic patient data generation and reduce expertise requirements in developing new disease modules.

Method: The paper details techniques for LLM utilization, including generating disease profiles, modules, evaluating modules, and iterative refinement called progressive refinement.

Result: LLMs show promise in supporting disease module creation for Synthea, but challenges such as human oversight and the need for rigorous testing are identified.

Conclusion: LLMs can aid synthetic data creation with recommendations for further research to address limitations and improve reliability.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

### [4] [Measuring and Analyzing Intelligence via Contextual Uncertainty in Large Language Models using Information-Theoretic Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21129)
*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-agnostic method to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) process information by analyzing their cognitive profiles through Entropy Decay Curves and the Information Gain Span index.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics focus on measuring what LLMs can achieve but fail to explain the internal mechanisms driving these capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a novel task-agnostic methodology to create cognitive profiles of LLMs, centering on Entropy Decay Curves and introducing the Information Gain Span (IGS) index.

Result: The method successfully uncovers unique, consistent profiles of LLMs and demonstrates sensitivity to variables like model scale and text complexity.

Conclusion: This approach offers a principled way to investigate and compare LLMs' operational mechanisms, enhancing the understanding of how they function internally.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

Language Model (LLM) performance on definite integral problems. INTEGRALBENCH
provides both symbolic and numerical ground truth solutions with manual
difficulty annotations. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
significant performance gaps and strong correlations between problem difficulty

rigorous evaluation framework specifically tailored for definite integral
computation.

### [6] [NPO: Learning Alignment and Meta-Alignment through Structured Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21131)
*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NPO, a framework for improving alignment in decision systems using structured feedback, combining theory and practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static or post-hoc alignment approaches in human-in-the-loop decision systems by introducing an adaptive and measurable framework.

Method: NPO defines alignment loss, meta-alignment fidelity, and introduces a scalable operational loop with structured feedback mechanisms, complemented by formal convergence results.

Result: NPO is shown to be effective in hyperscale deployment scenarios, supported by simulations, ablation studies, and formal analyses of its principles.

Conclusion: NPO provides a systematic and practical approach for continual alignment monitoring, bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

### [7] [Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132)
*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) handle high-stakes advice and investigates safety concerns such as sycophancy and over-confidence through experiments and safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of standard safeguards in LLMs when offering life-changing advice, and to mitigate risks associated with sycophancy and over-confidence.

Method: The paper conducts three experiments: evaluating model stability through multiple-choice tests, analyzing safety using free-response typology, and steering behavior via activation vector manipulation.

Result: Findings show some models like o4-mini are robust against sycophancy, top models use clarifying questions to enhance safety, and cautiousness can be directly controlled through activation steering.

Conclusion: LLMs need nuanced benchmarks and mechanisms like activation steering to ensure they provide safe and reliable high-stakes advice.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

### [8] [Project Patti: Why can You Solve Diabolical Puzzles on one Sudoku Website but not Easy Puzzles on another Sudoku Website?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21137)
*Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes two new metrics for evaluating Sudoku puzzle difficulty by converting Sudoku into SAT problems and simulating human strategies. Analyzing puzzles from five websites, it shows strong correlations between metrics and difficulty levels, and introduces a universal Sudoku difficulty rating system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inconsistencies in Sudoku difficulty ratings across popular Sudoku websites and to create a universal rating system.

Method: Two metrics for Sudoku difficulty are proposed: (1) analysis of SAT Clause Length Distribution to capture structural puzzle complexity; (2) simulation of human-solving strategies intertwined with a Nishio backtracking algorithm. These metrics are evaluated across hundreds of puzzles using Spearman's rank correlation and classified via an unsupervised method.

Result: The proposed metrics strongly correlate with difficulty levels on 4 out of 5 websites. The universal rating system aligns well with most website-labeled difficulty levels, enabling consistent mapping of difficulties.

Conclusion: The universal rating system and proposed metrics effectively standardize Sudoku puzzle difficulty across websites. Additionally, the paper introduces an algorithm for early practitioners to solve puzzles.

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

### [9] [The Geometry of Harmfulness in LLMs through Subconcept Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21141)
*McNair Shah,Saleena Angeline,Adhitya Rajendra Kumar,Naitik Chheda,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien,Will Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that identifies and manipulates harmful content in large language models using a low-dimensional framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the pressing need to understand and mitigate harmful behaviors in large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors train linear probes for 55 harmfulness subconcepts, define a low-dimensional harmfulness subspace in the model, and perform ablation and steering techniques in this space.

Result: Dominant direction steering effectively reduces harmfulness with minimal impact on task utility, revealing the low-rank nature of harmfulness-related features.

Conclusion: Concept subspaces serve as a scalable and interpretable framework to audit and improve the safety of LLMs for future iterations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

### [10] [Adaptive XAI in High Stakes Environments: Modeling Swift Trust with Multimodal Feedback in Human AI Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21158)
*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a conceptual framework for Adaptive Explainable AI (AXTF) tailored for high-stakes human-AI collaboration, using real-time cognitive and emotional state detection to foster swift trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods often fail in high-pressure scenarios because they rely on uniform explanations and explicit feedback, which are impractical under cognitive and time constraints.

Method: The framework uses physiological and behavioral signals (EEG, ECG, eye tracking) to infer user states and employs a personalized trust model that maps cognitive and emotional states to dynamic trust metrics for explanation adaptation.

Result: The framework proposes a novel approach to adjust AI explanations based on real-time user feedback, enhancing trust and collaboration in time-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: AXTF provides a promising direction for creating adaptive and intuitive XAI systems, especially in scenarios requiring rapid and effective decision-making, like emergency response.

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

### [11] [Adaptive Cluster Collaborativeness Boosts LLMs Medical Decision Support Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21159)
*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive methodology to improve LLMs' performance in medical decision support by selecting cluster components based on self-diversity and cross-consistency measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing LLM architectures in healthcare, which lack rules for component selection and often underperform due to predefined clusters.

Method: The proposed method involves (1) measuring self-diversity values by fuzzy matching pairwise outputs within an LLM and prioritizing high-diversity LLMs as cluster components, and (2) using cross-consistency values to eliminate LLMs with inconsistent outputs gradually.

Result: Experiments on medical datasets (NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health) show significant improvements in physician-oriented tasks, surpassing GPT-4's performance, particularly in the Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enables adaptive selection of LLM clusters to enhance medical decision support, achieving greater reliability and accuracy across specialties compared to leading LLM systems.

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

### [12] [Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21162)
*Xu Yang,Chenhui Lin,Yue Yang,Qi Wang,Haotian Liu,Haizhou Hua,Wenchuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated modeling and optimization approach using large language models (LLMs) to enable intelligent, flexible dispatch of active distribution networks (ADNs) with minimal technical expertise required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many distributed energy resource operators in ADNs lack technical expertise in power systems, making it essential to develop a more accessible and efficient dispatch mechanism.

Method: The framework relies on a multi-LLM coordination architecture comprising an Information Extractor, Problem Formulator, and Code Programmer. Tailored refinement techniques improve the accuracy of tasks like information retrieval, problem formulation, and code execution.

Result: The approach was validated through comprehensive comparisons and demonstrations on various test cases, confirming its effectiveness in generating ADN dispatch strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-powered method reduces technical barriers for ADN operators by enabling natural language-based interaction for dispatch, significantly improving efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

### [13] [An ontological analysis of risk in Basic Formal Ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21171)
*Federico Donato,Adrien Barton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper characterizes 'risk' using the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), classifying it as a subclass of 'BFO:Role' instead of 'BFO:Disposition.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured understanding of the concept of 'risk' within the framework of formal ontology.

Method: The paper applies the Basic Formal Ontology categories, contrasting the classification of risk as 'BFO:Role' instead of 'BFO:Disposition,' using a specific example to analyze sufficient conditions for risk.

Result: The study concludes that 'risk' is better modeled as a subclass of 'BFO:Role.' Future work is suggested to explore plausible necessary conditions.

Conclusion: The paper offers a refined ontological characterization of risk, settling on 'BFO:Role' and laying groundwork for further exploration of necessary conditions.

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

### [14] [LeMix: Unified Scheduling for LLM Training and Inference on Multi-GPU Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21276)
*Yufei Li,Zexin Li,Yinglun Zhu,Cong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeMix is a system that improves the efficiency of large language model (LLM) deployment by co-locating inference serving and training workloads, increasing throughput and responsiveness compared to traditional setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle inefficiencies like GPU idleness and slow adaptation to new data that arise from separate deployment setups for LLM inference and continuous retraining.

Method: LeMix employs offline profiling, execution prediction, and runtime scheduling to dynamically allocate resources based on workload characteristics and system conditions.

Result: Experiments show LeMix achieves up to 3.53x higher throughput, reduces inference loss by up to 0.61x, and improves response time SLO attainment by up to 2.12x compared to traditional setups.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of LLM inference and training through LeMix improves resource utilization and serving quality, representing a significant advance in efficient LLM deployment.

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

*Farzana Islam Adiba,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework that uses knowledge graphs (KGs) and auxiliary large language models (LLMs) to identify bias patterns in medical LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in medical large language models can lead to unfair outcomes, and identifying such biases is essential for their effective adoption in clinical decision-making.

Method: The framework combines KGs with adversarial perturbation techniques and multi-hop characterizations to systematically evaluate and identify subtle bias patterns in medical LLMs.

Result: In experiments involving three datasets, six LLMs, and five bias types, the framework demonstrated greater scalability and accuracy in revealing bias patterns compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a scalable and effective way to identify complex bias in LLMs, supporting their improved development and clinical application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of the 'Agentic Web,' where AI agents autonomously interact to perform tasks, and proposes a framework to understand and develop it based on intelligence, interaction, and economics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the shift towards autonomous and goal-driven interactions on the internet, aiming to enable a more efficient and automated web experience.

Method: The authors present a conceptual framework comprising three dimensions (intelligence, interaction, and economics), analyze infrastructural challenges, and explore emerging paradigms like the Agent Attention Economy.

Result: The study identifies core technological foundations and challenges while proposing strategies to address them and fostering a deeper understanding of autonomous agent-based systems.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems that balance human intent with autonomous behavior, while also addressing societal and governance challenges.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously
updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at:

### [18] [CompoST: A Benchmark for Analyzing the Ability of LLMs To Compositionally Interpret Questions in a QALD Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21257)
*David Maria Schmidt,Raoul Schubert,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a benchmark to evaluate how systematically large language models (LLMs) interpret questions compositionally, mapping them to SPARQL queries, and reveals LLMs' limitations in compositionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the extent to which LLMs can systematically and compositionally interpret natural language questions and translate them into SPARQL queries.

Method: The authors created three datasets with varying difficulty levels based on graph patterns in DBpedia using Lemon lexica for controlled question verbalization, and evaluated LLMs through different optimization and fine-tuning methods.

Result: The macro F1 scores significantly decreased as complexity increased, with scores of 0.45, 0.26, and 0.09, and the best F1 score (0.57) for the simplest dataset still revealed notable limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs experience significant challenges in systematically and compositionally interpreting complex questions, even with clear atomic understanding and comprehensive input information.

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a coding assistant with a fine-tuned LLM that generates clarification questions for ambiguous prompts, improving generated code accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of incorrect code generation due to ambiguous developer prompts, caused by current LLMs struggling to infer user intent.

Method: The system comprises a query classifier for detecting unclear prompts and a fine-tuned LLM designed to ask clarification questions.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM performs better than zero-shot prompting in producing clarification questions, and users prefer the generated questions over baseline models.

Conclusion: A coding assistant that mimics human code reviews enhances code response accuracy and usefulness by effectively handling ambiguous queries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for structured relevance assessment to enhance the reliability of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) by improving document evaluation and knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RALMs struggle with factual errors due to issues in document relevance evaluation and effective knowledge integration, necessitating better mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability.

Method: The approach utilizes a multi-dimensional scoring system that evaluates both semantic matching and source reliability, integrates synthetic training data with diverse document quality, and introduces mechanisms for niche topic benchmarking and handling unanswerable queries.

Result: The results reveal a significant reduction in hallucination rates and better transparency in reasoning processes, highlighting improved model reliability.

Conclusion: This framework represents progress in developing dependable question-answering systems that can efficiently navigate dynamic and varying data environments, though challenges like latency and credibility differentiation persist.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

*Monika Zamojska,Jaros≈Çaw A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Trans-ACT, a toolkit integrating Transactional Analysis principles into Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for realistic psychological agent simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) frameworks that fail to account for the underlying cognitive complexity of human behavior.

Method: Introduced Trans-ACT, which incorporates Parent, Adult, and Child ego states into agents' cognitive architectures for context-specific memory-based decision-making rooted in life scripts.

Result: Simulation of a 'Stupid game' scenario showed that Trans-ACT agents achieved deeper and context-aware interactions.

Conclusion: Trans-ACT enables psychologically realistic agent interactions and has potential applications in conflict resolution, education, and social psychology.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

*Nicholas Botti,Flora Haberkorn,Charlotte Hoopes,Shaun Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of an AI retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tool to assist in complex information extraction and data annotation tasks, comparing naive and interactive AI-assisted conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if AI tools enhance efficiency and accuracy in challenging annotation tasks involving heterogeneous real-world datasets.

Method: A within-subjects design with randomized tasks examines two scenarios: naive AI use (accepting the first answer) and interactive AI use (user judgment for follow-ups), applied to annotating thousands of pages of GSIB disclosure documents.

Result: The AI tool accelerated task execution by up to 10x and improved accuracy, especially under interactive conditions, saving up to 268 hours when extrapolated.

Conclusion: AI-assisted annotation tools are highly effective, particularly with interactive use and skilled annotators, highlighting the importance of training users not only in domain-specific knowledge but also in leveraging AI tools effectively.

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid model using Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) and XGBoost for optimizing multi-tier supply chains, aiming to address adaptability and efficiency challenges, including the bullwhip effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supply chain management methods struggle with dynamic market conditions and limitations of emerging machine learning techniques. Liquid Neural Networks, though successful in specific domains, remain underexplored in supply chains, motivating this research.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid framework combining LNN for dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost for global optimization to address supply chain issues like the bullwhip effect.

Result: The hybrid LNN-XGBoost model shows potential in mitigating the bullwhip effect and enhancing cumulative supply chain profitability by leveraging local and global synergies.

Conclusion: This innovative approach provides an adaptive, efficient solution for supply chain management challenges, filling critical gaps in existing methodologies.

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

### [25] [Teaching Language Models To Gather Information Proactively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21389)
*Tenghao Huang,Sihao Chen,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Longqi Yang,Mengting Wan,Pei Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new paradigm for large language models (LLMs) to proactively gather information through questioning, addressing gaps in ambiguous or incomplete prompts, thereby enhancing quality and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current LLMs, which often provide passive or narrow responses in real-world tasks that involve ambiguity or incomplete prompts, falling short in eliciting the missing user knowledge required for generating high-quality outcomes.

Method: A framework is proposed that generates real-world tasks with deliberately masked key information, requiring LLMs to employ proactive questioning. A reinforcement fine-tuning strategy is used to reward LLMs for eliciting implicit user knowledge and filling informational gaps.

Result: The Qwen-2.5-7B model, after training using the proposed method, achieves an 18% increase over the o3-mini baseline on automatic metrics. Human evaluations further validate the model's effectiveness, showing preferences for its clarifications and final outputs by 42% and 28%, respectively.

Conclusion: Proactive information gathering transforms LLMs from passive text generators to effective collaborators capable of bridging informational gaps, making them more adept at solving complex, ambiguous tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

*Malik Uzair Mehmood,Shahid Hussain,Wen Li Wang,Muhammad Usama Malik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research utilizes fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify sections of GitHub README files, achieving an impressive F1 score of 0.98 and proposing economical fine-tuning alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observation that incomplete or poorly designed README files hinder GitHub repositories from achieving their potential in adoption and usage.

Method: The authors fine-tune three encoder-only LLMs (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) using a dataset of over 4200 README sections, and examine efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: The fine-tuned LLMs achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.98 in classifying README sections, with LoRA providing a resource-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate README classification, enhancing repository usability and fostering tools for better identification and utilization of GitHub projects.

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

*Meilin Zhu,Gaojie Jin,Xiaowei Huang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Shapley-based uncertainty metric to enhance performance prediction of large language models (LLMs) in question-answering tasks, surpassing traditional threshold-based measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the accuracy of uncertainty measurement in LLM outputs for question-answering tasks, moving beyond the limitations of threshold-based semantic equivalence metrics introduced by previous research.

Method: A Shapley-based uncertainty metric is developed, characterized by three fundamental properties for valid uncertainty assessment and supported by theoretical proofs.

Result: The Shapley uncertainty metric demonstrated superior performance in predicting LLM outputs compared to baseline measures in experiments across various datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Shapley-based metric provides a more precise and continuous method of assessing uncertainty in semantic relationships, enhancing confidence in LLM results in question-answering scenarios.

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in LLM-based autonomous agents by leveraging graphs as auxiliary structures to improve their capabilities and coordination.

Method: Categorized existing Graph-augmented LLM Agent (GLA) methods by function, analyzing how graphs and graph-learning algorithms impact planning, memory, tool usage, and multi-agent systems.

Result: GLAs improve orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness in multi-agent systems while facilitating more structured and adaptive workflows for individual agents.

Conclusion: Graphs are crucial for advancing LLM-based agent systems, and the paper provides a roadmap for future research to enable adaptable, scalable, and multimodal solutions.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is insufficient assessment of the domain relevance and core capabilities of LLMs in the government sector beyond safety considerations.

Method: The authors developed GovRelBench with a dedicated model, GovRelBERT, utilizing the SoftGovScore method, which converts hard labels to soft scores for relevance training.

Result: GovRelBench demonstrated its effectiveness in evaluating government domain relevance in LLMs, providing a reliable framework for domain-specific capability evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a robust evaluation framework, enabling enhanced assessment of LLMs in the government domain, with tools and resources publicly accessible.

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the
models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.

*Vishal Raman,Vijai Aravindh R*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-DKD, a dual-decoder framework, integrates structured ontology traversal with unstructured text reasoning to autonomously evolve ontologies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually evolving ontologies and knowledge graphs is labor-intensive, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the consistency required for structured updates.

Method: Evo-DKD uses a dual-decoder framework within an LLM. One decoder generates ontology edits, while another creates textual justifications. It employs a dynamic gating mechanism to coordinate structured and unstructured knowledge and operates in a closed reasoning loop to validate, update, and refine ontologies.

Result: Evo-DKD outperformed baselines in healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search improvement, and cultural heritage modeling, showing superior precision in ontology updates and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-decoder design and gating mechanism effectively bridge structured and neural reasoning, enabling sustainable and efficient ontology evolution.

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Motivation: To explore enhancing AI-based personalized decision-making in pharmacogenomics using combined CPIC and PharmGKB resources.

Method: Sherpa Rx was evaluated on a dataset of 260 queries spanning 26 CPIC guidelines; response metrics were scored and compared across two phases and against ChatGPT-4omini.

Result: Sherpa Rx achieved high accuracy, relevance, clarity, and recall, outperforming ChatGPT-4omini significantly in accuracy and completeness.

Conclusion: Integrating CPIC and PharmGKB data using RAG in Sherpa Rx demonstrates improved AI performance in pharmacogenomics, aiding personalized clinical decisions.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

### [32] [An LLM Driven Agent Framework for Automated Infrared Spectral Multi Task Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21471)
*Zujie Xie,Zixuan Chen,Jiheng Liang,Xiangyang Yu,Ziru Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automating accurate analysis of infrared (IR) spectroscopy under low-data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in infrared spectroscopy, which include high-dimensional overlapping spectral bands and limited data conditions.

Method: An LLM-driven agent framework integrates a structured literature knowledge base, spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi-task reasoning using few-shot learning and iterative refinement protocols.

Result: The framework significantly outperformed other machine learning and deep learning models in diverse materials analysis under low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-driven multi-turn reasoning is effective for automating IR spectral interpretation, showcasing novel applications of LLMs in scientific workflows and addressing spectral analysis challenges.

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Maia4All, a framework for modeling individual decision-making in chess efficiently using minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop AI systems that can emulate individual human decision-making effectively and address the challenge of current models requiring large datasets, using chess as a benchmark.

Method: The method involves a two-stage optimization: (1) enrichment with a prototype-enriched model to connect population and individual behavior, and (2) democratization to refine individual embeddings with minimal data.

Result: Maia4All accurately predicts individual moves and profiles behavior using only 20 games, compared to older models needing 5,000 games, marking a significant improvement in data efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach sets a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior modeling in chess, and has potential applications beyond chess, demonstrated by a case study on LLMs.

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

### [34] [Large Language Models for Supply Chain Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21502)
*David Simchi-Levi,Konstantina Mellou,Ishai Menache,Jeevan Pathuri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can democratize supply chain technology by addressing challenges in decision-making, scenario analysis, and model updates, reducing decision times and boosting productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supply chain decision-making processes are hindered by the need for human intervention to analyze outcomes, address what-if questions, and update tools, which slows decision-making and requires significant effort from data science teams.

Method: The paper examines how to leverage advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify interactions with supply chain technologies, make their outcomes more interpretable, and enable more autonomous operation without human-in-the-loop.

Result: LLMs can address the challenges in supply chain management by enabling faster decision-making, reducing time from days and weeks to minutes and hours, and significantly improving productivity and impact for planners and executives.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into supply chain management has the potential to transform decision-making by making systems more accessible, efficient, and responsive to dynamic business environments.

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

*Yanxu Zhu,Shitong Duan,Xiangxu Zhang,Jitao Sang,Peng Zhang,Tun Lu,Xiao Zhou,Jing Yao,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates honesty in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using a newly developed benchmark (MoHoBench) and identifies gaps in their responses to unanswerable visual questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the largely unexplored issue of honesty in MLLMs, especially when dealing with visually unanswerable questions, and to ensure their trustworthiness.

Method: The authors created a benchmark called MoHoBench, consisting of 12k+ verified visual question samples, and evaluated 28 MLLMs using this dataset. They also implemented initial methods to align MLLMs for better honest behavior.

Result: The study found that most MLLMs inadequately refused to answer unanswerable questions and that their honesty depends on both visual and language modeling, requiring dedicated methods for improvement.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundation for improving MLLMs' honesty by introducing a benchmark and initial alignment methods, prompting further work toward trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Assistax, a benchmark leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) for assistive robotics tasks, designed for physics-based simulations with significant acceleration using JAX.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL benchmarks, such as games like Go and Atari, do not sufficiently address real-world embodied applications like assistive robotics.

Method: Assistax employs JAX for hardware-accelerated learning in physics-based simulations, and uses multi-agent RL for testing zero-shot coordination in assistive robot-patient scenarios.

Result: Assistax achieves up to 370x faster open-loop wall-clock time compared to CPU-based alternatives and establishes reliable baselines using popular continuous control RL and MARL algorithms.

Conclusion: Assistax offers a specialized, high-performance benchmark for RL research in assistive robotics, filling gaps in current evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

*Kenneth Li,Fernanda Vi√©gas,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes precise criteria for defining when a neural network learns and uses a 'world model,' focusing on latent state space representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Terms like 'world model' are often used informally in AI literature, creating ambiguity in experimental studies. The paper aims to establish a formal and operational definition to promote clarity.

Method: The authors base the criteria on linear probing concepts, defining computations that rely on a representation of the data generation process, while adding conditions to ensure the model isn't trivially derived.

Result: The outcome is a set of precise guidelines to identify whether neural networks construct and use meaningful world models not tied solely to their data or task.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational framework for rigorously assessing world models in neural networks, facilitating structured experimental analysis.

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ST-GDance is a group dance generation framework that optimizes long-term and collision-free choreography by decoupling spatial and temporal dependencies, using graph convolutions and sparse attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in computational complexity and motion collisions in generating coordinated group dance choreography from music, especially for larger groups and longer sequences.

Method: It proposes a framework called ST-GDance that employs lightweight graph convolutions for spatial dependencies and sparse attention for temporal modeling to reduce computational costs and improve collision-free interactions.

Result: Experimental results on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generating long and coherent dance sequences.

Conclusion: ST-GDance effectively optimizes group dance choreography, offering scalable, efficient, and collision-free motion synchronization solutions for large-scale choreography.

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how large language models (LLMs) can transform wireless systems through pretrained adaptation, wireless-specific foundation models, and autonomous reasoning. Unique benefits and future challenges are outlined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the advanced capabilities of LLMs to address the increasing complexity and dynamics in wireless communications.

Method: The paper proposes three main approaches: adapting pretrained LLMs for communication tasks, creating wireless-specific foundation models, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous capabilities.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based approaches for improved intelligence, adaptability, and efficiency in wireless systems compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs could lead to intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous wireless communications by addressing open challenges like multimodal fusion and lightweight collaboration.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization,
and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless
communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and
adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming
wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core
communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance
versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional

*Laura Spillner,Nima Zargham,Mihai Pomarlan,Robert Porzel,Rainer Malaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for a personalized AI explanation model focusing on user preferences and context, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard AI explanations that are often too technical and not suited for non-expert users.

Method: The paper proposes a user-centric model where an agent uses a dynamic memory to store and analyze past interactions. This allows the agent to estimate what information is new or relevant to a user.

Result: The proposed approach enables agents to personalize explanations and improve user understanding based on individual preferences and contexts.

Conclusion: A personalized, context-aware explanation mechanism fosters more effective and human-centered interactions between users and AI systems.

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark (SafeDrive228K) and a novel model (SafeDriveRAG) to assess and improve vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving safety-critical tasks. Results show significant performance gains in key areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked evaluation of vision-language models in traffic safety-critical driving scenarios, focusing on enhancing autonomous vehicle safety.

Method: The authors create a benchmark (SafeDrive228K) featuring diverse traffic safety queries and propose a retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) framework utilizing a multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm enriched with traffic safety guidelines.

Result: Experimental results reveal notable improvements in VLMs accuracy on safety-critical tasks: +4.73% in Traffic Accidents, +8.79% in Corner Cases, and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense.

Conclusion: The proposed SafeDriveRAG framework and benchmark significantly advance the application of VLMs in traffic safety, suggesting strong potential for practical use in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

TL;DR: This paper presents PHP, a three-stage method for audio-visual multi-task incremental learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance by balancing knowledge retention and learning adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving old task knowledge while effectively learning new tasks in audio-visual multi-task incremental learning.

Method: The proposed method, PHP, operates in three stages: (1) a task-shared modality-aggregating adapter for cross-task and cross-modal learning, (2) a task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter for knowledge retention and transferability, and (3) task-specific modality-independent prompts for task and modality refinement.

Result: PHP demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across different sequences of four tasks: AVE, AVVP, AVS, and AVQA.

Conclusion: PHP successfully balances knowledge sharing and specificity through a progressive three-stage adapter approach, outperforming competitors in audio-visual multi-task incremental learning.

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

*Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the intersection of Bayesian statistics with embodied intelligence, highlighting its potential and examining the barriers to its adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Bayesian principles have not been central in embodied intelligence systems and explore their potential applications.

Method: The authors analyze current embodied intelligence approaches through the dual lenses of Bayesian inference and AI themes of search and learning.

Result: The study identifies shortcomings in current embodied intelligence systems, which are limited to closed environments, and emphasizes the possibilities for open-world expansion using Bayesian methods.

Conclusion: Bayesian methods could significantly enhance embodied intelligence in open-world scenarios, but are underutilized due to conceptual and practical barriers.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper explores extending the concept of legibility in sequential decision-making to multi-agent teams, showcasing improved performance in collaborative settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current works focus on legibility in single-agent interactions with humans, neglecting the potential advantages in multi-agent or team scenarios.

Method: The authors propose an approach to bring legibility into multi-agent systems and evaluate its effectiveness using benchmark scenarios.

Result: A multi-agent team incorporating a legible agent demonstrates superior performance compared to teams with standard optimal agents.

Conclusion: Legibility in decision-making for multi-agent teams offers significant advantages in collaborative tasks, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

### [45] [StaffPro: an LLM Agent for Joint Staffing and Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21636)
*Alessio Maritan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces StaffPro, an LLM agent designed for workforce management by addressing staffing and profiling challenges jointly. It employs natural language input, uses continuous feedback for life-long worker profiling, and ensures optimal staffing with high-quality schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle workforce management issues involving task scheduling and profiling of workers' attributes, which are interdependent but challenging to address jointly, using a human-centric and flexible approach.

Method: StaffPro integrates LLMs with modular algorithmic components to link staffing decisions with latent feature estimation. It allows natural language input for optimization objectives and employs a human-agent feedback loop for continuous profiling.

Result: StaffPro demonstrates the capability to estimate workers' attributes effectively and generate high-quality schedules, validated through a consulting firm simulation example.

Conclusion: StaffPro offers an innovative, interpretable, and human-centric solution for automated workforce management, promoting seamless interaction and flexible optimization.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

### [46] [Self-Aware Safety Augmentation: Leveraging Internal Semantic Understanding to Enhance Safety in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21637)
*Wanying Wang,Zeyu Ma,Han Zheng,Xin Tan,Mingang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the safety vulnerabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) and proposes a novel technique, SASA, to enhance model safety by using inherent semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are more susceptible to harmful input compared to their language-only variants, highlighting the need for an approach to improve their safety.

Method: The study introduces Self-Aware Safety Augmentation (SASA), which utilizes intermediate semantic representations to boost safety-oriented layers without fine-tuning, alongside linear probing to assess semantic comprehension for risk detection.

Result: Experiments show that SASA significantly enhances LVLMs' safety across datasets and tasks while preserving their utility.

Conclusion: SASA proves effective in improving model safety by leveraging intermediate semantic representations, offering a promising direction for addressing LVLMs' inherent vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

*Mariam Alsayyad,Fayadh Kadhem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI's capability to manage a full college-level mathematics course across syllabus creation, presentation, student interaction, and assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating whether AI can independently handle all aspects of teaching a university-level mathematics course is crucial as education increasingly incorporates AI technologies.

Method: The study analyzes AI in four aspects: course syllabus creation, material presentation, answering questions, and assessments.

Result: AI demonstrates strong organization and accuracy but lacks emotional nuances essential for teaching and fails to fully replicate human elements.

Conclusion: AI must be integrated with human capabilities to successfully deliver a comprehensive university-level mathematics course.

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

### [48] [Unrolling Dynamic Programming via Graph Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21705)
*Sergio Rozada,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic programming is enhanced with a model named BellNet, which leverages graph signal processing to optimize Bellman's equations for complex Markov decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard dynamic programming methods are computationally expensive when dealing with large state-action spaces or long-term dependencies.

Method: A parametric model named BellNet is proposed as a learnable system that minimizes Bellman errors using graph signal processing principles. It reinterprets MDPs as weighted directed graphs for computational efficiency.

Result: BellNet demonstrated the ability to approximate optimal policies effectively and with reduced computational iterations in preliminary grid-world environment tests.

Conclusion: BellNet offers a compact, efficient alternative to classical policy iteration methods, with promising implications for complex Markov decision processes.

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

*Jianfei Zhu,Haiqi Zhu,Shaohui Liu,Feng Jiang,Baichun Wei,Chunzhi Yi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes GDAIP, a framework combining Graph Attention Networks and Minimax Entropy for domain adaptation in individual brain parcellation using fMRI data across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with domain shifts in cross-dataset individual brain parcellation, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: GDAIP integrates graph-based modeling with semi-supervised training and adversarial optimization to adapt a reference atlas from group-level to individual-level brain graphs.

Result: Experimental findings show GDAIP achieves consistent, functional, and topologically plausible individual brain parcellations across sessions.

Conclusion: GDAIP demonstrates efficiency in handling domain shifts, advancing robust individual brain parcellation in varied datasets.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

TL;DR: This paper studies bounded fitting for ALC (a description logic) and its fragments, proving the fitting problem to be NP-complete and proposing a SAT solver-based implementation with optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The recent interest in bounded fitting as a means to learn logical formulas motivates its analysis in the context of the ALC description logic, focusing on computational complexity and practical guarantees.

Method: The study examines the computational complexity of bounded fitting for ALC and its fragments and compares it under Valiant's PAC learning framework. It also presents a SAT solver implementation and discusses optimization techniques.

Result: Bounded fitting in ALC and its fragments was proven to be NP-complete, even for simple test cases. The study also demonstrates the probabilistic guarantees of bounded fitting algorithms, in contrast to others.

Conclusion: Bounded fitting offers rigorous guarantees under the PAC learning framework for ALC, but comes with computational complexity. The proposed SAT solver-based implementation shows potential with further optimizations.

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address issues in the reliability of RAG systems, such as hallucination and off-topic responses, especially in critical sectors like healthcare and finance.

Method: It introduces an evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge annotations, inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) method, providing statistical guarantees for measuring performance.

Result: The study develops a dataset and achieves precise performance measurements for RAG systems, identifying system failures effectively.

Conclusion: The contributions enhance the evaluation and reliability of RAG systems for industrial applications, improving their robustness for high-risk sectors.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk
sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is
particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document

contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This
study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed
citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI)
method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical

### [52] [Hybrid Causal Identification and Causal Mechanism Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21792)
*Saixiong Liu,Yuhua Qian,Jue Li,Honghong Cheng,Feijiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference model (MCVCI) to identify causal directions in heterogeneous settings, leveraging Gaussian mixture models and conditional variational auto-encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing binary causal inference methods use a single causal mechanism and fail to address situations involving heterogeneity, where real-world data often presents varying causal relationships across different environments.

Method: The MCVCI model integrates Hybrid Additive Noise Models (HANM), Gaussian mixture models, and neural networks. Likelihoods derived from a mixture conditional variational auto-encoder are used as decision criteria. Additionally, the MCVCC method is introduced to map causal heterogeneity via clustering.

Result: MCVCI and MCVCC outperform state-of-the-art methods in causal direction identification, shown through experiments on both simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively infer heterogeneous causal structures and improve our understanding of causal relationships in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

*Junzhe Li,Yutao Cui,Tao Huang,Yinping Ma,Chun Fan,Miles Yang,Zhao Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixGRPO proposes an efficient differential equation-based optimization framework to improve human preference alignment in image generation, achieving significant performance gains and reduced training times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models like GRPO enhance flow matching for human preference in image generation but struggle with inefficiencies due to optimizing across all Markov Decision Process (MDP) steps.

Method: MixGRPO integrates stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE) with a sliding window mechanism. This confines randomness and reduces optimization overhead by focusing SDE and GRPO-guided optimization within the window, while supporting faster solvers outside the window.

Result: MixGRPO outperforms DanceGRPO in human preference alignment effectiveness and efficiency, achieving nearly 50% lower training time. MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.

Conclusion: The MixGRPO framework significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of human preference alignment in image generation. It streamlines optimization and reduces training time while maintaining comparable performance through advanced sampling strategies.

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a new agent-based approach to business process design, focusing on goals and collaboration among AI agents instead of traditional task-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for more intelligent, flexible, and context-aware business processes in dynamic industrial environments.

Method: The method involves using Agentic AI to create goal-centered business processes, with single agents handling simple goals and collaborative efforts for merge goals.

Result: The result is a modular and intelligent business process model, organized around goals, objects, and agents.

Conclusion: Agentic AI provides a new framework for designing adaptable and smart business processes, contributing to the evolution of industrial automation.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualSG, a dual-stream framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic guidance for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF), improving interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for applying LLMs in multivariate time series forecasting often result in numerical imprecision or alignment difficulties, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes using LLMs as semantic guides rather than primary forecasters. It introduces Time Series Captioning to summarize trends in natural language and a caption-guided fusion module to model inter-variable relationships.

Result: DualSG demonstrates consistent performance improvements, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets across various domains.

Conclusion: Incorporating explicit semantic guidance from LLMs through DualSG provides a robust and interpretable approach to MTSF, achieving superior accuracy and context alignment.

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active Goal Recognition (AGR) combines probabilistic frameworks with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to strategically reduce uncertainty in multi-agent settings without domain-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the beliefs and intentions of other agents in multi-agent environments is key to effective interaction, yet prior work has treated observers as passive entities, failing to strategically reduce uncertainty.

Method: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for AGR by integrating joint belief updates with MCTS, enabling an active observer to efficiently infer goals without domain-specific assumptions.

Result: Empirical evaluations in a grid-based domain show that joint belief updates outperform passive methods, while the domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to a strong domain-specific baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical, domain-independent, and robust method for goal inference, enhancing interactivity and adaptability in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses the issue of advantage collapse in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by proposing a novel algorithm, EDGE-GRPO, which incorporates entropy-driven advantage and error correction strategies, demonstrating improved results in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent problem of advantage collapse in GRPO algorithms, which hinder the performance of LLMs in reasoning tasks.

Method: EDGE-GRPO combines an entropy-driven advantage mechanism with guided error correction to mitigate the sparsity and uniformity issues in rewards, enhancing the training signal for better model learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks reveal that EDGE-GRPO outperforms existing methods, showing its effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO is a robust solution for tackling the limitations of advantage collapse in GRPO, paving the way for more efficient reinforcement learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge posed by real-world data's long-tailed distribution, especially for rare and safety-critical vehicle categories, in autonomous driving systems.

Method: Introduces MultiEditor with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a prior, multi-level appearance control mechanisms, and a depth-guided deformable cross-modality condition module to enhance data editing and multimodal consistency.

Result: MultiEditor demonstrates superior performance in terms of fidelity, controllability, and consistency. It also significantly improves the detection accuracy of rare vehicle categories.

Conclusion: The proposed MultiEditor framework effectively addresses the limitations of rare-category vehicle data, enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving perception models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

TL;DR: This paper integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs) for enhanced graph data modeling, combining learning and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in GNNs' reasoning abilities by leveraging the symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference strengths of RBNs.

Method: The paper proposes two integration approaches: compiling GNNs into RBN language and using GNNs as external components. It introduces a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for neuro-symbolic models.

Result: The framework improves node classification accuracy by modeling label patterns and solves a complex environmental network optimization problem. Two benchmark datasets are provided.

Conclusion: This neuro-symbolic approach enhances graph data analysis, offering novel applications and better performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

individuals suffering from pain, as well as for developing effective management
strategies in a healthcare system. Automatic pain assessment systems enable
continuous monitoring, support clinical decision-making, and help minimize
patient distress while mitigating the risk of functional deterioration.
Leveraging physiological signals offers objective and precise insights into a
person's state, and their integration in a multimodal framework can further
enhance system performance. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second
Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The
proposed approach introduces \textit{Tiny-BioMoE}, a lightweight pretrained
embedding model for biosignal analysis. Trained on $4.4$ million biosignal
image representations and consisting of only $7.3$ million parameters, it
serves as an effective tool for extracting high-quality embeddings for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments involving electrodermal activity, blood
volume pulse, respiratory signals, peripheral oxygen saturation, and their
combinations highlight the model's effectiveness across diverse modalities in
automatic pain recognition tasks. \textit{\textcolor{blue}{The model's

### [64] [Thou Shalt Not Prompt: Zero-Shot Human Activity Recognition in Smart Homes via Language Modeling of Sensor Data & Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21964)
*Sourish Gunesh Dhekane,Thomas Ploetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) technique using language embeddings, avoiding the need to prompt large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations and risks of current zero-shot HAR systems that rely heavily on prompting LLMs, including privacy concerns and inconsistent predictions.

Method: The proposed method models sensor data and activities using natural language embeddings to achieve zero-shot activity classification without relying on LLM prompts.

Result: A detailed case study is conducted across six datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach for zero-shot HAR.

Conclusion: The work showcases an alternative zero-shot HAR method that enhances system reliability and addresses key concerns associated with prompting LLMs.

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Motivation: The challenge in RCA for mobile networks comes from the need for interpretability, integrating domain expertise, and applying causal reasoning effectively.

Method: The paper presents a two-stage training process‚Äîsupervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning‚Äîto adapt existing LLMs for RCA. It also introduces TeleLogs, an annotated dataset for benchmarking RCA tasks.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in RCA performance, interpretability, and generalization across multiple LLM sizes compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted LLMs with enhanced reasoning capabilities show strong potential for practical, explainable RCA in mobile network operations.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PHAX, a framework enhancing AI explanations for public health, using structured argumentation to offer personalized, context-aware justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI-driven public health systems that require explanations tailored to diverse stakeholders for better trust and interpretability.

Method: The PHAX framework combines defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user modeling to create audience-specific, structured explanations.

Result: Demonstrated through use cases like medical term simplification, improved patient-clinician communication, and policy justification, PHAX enhances interpretability and trust.

Conclusion: PHAX aligns formal reasoning with communication needs, advancing human-centered, transparent AI applications in public health.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

TL;DR: This paper presents UI-AGILE, a new framework to improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based GUI agents during training and inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents face challenges in reasoning, ineffective reward mechanisms, and visual noise, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: UI-AGILE introduces enhancements for training, including Continuous Reward functions, "Simple Thinking" rewards, and Cropping-based Resampling, along with a novel inference method called Decomposed Grounding with Selection.

Result: UI-AGILE significantly improves grounding accuracy, achieving a 23% improvement over the best baseline on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates improved precision and performance in GUI agent training and inference, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: LLM agents excel in tasks but struggle in proactive collaboration with users who have vague or evolving goals. To study this, the authors developed UserBench, revealing a gap in user alignment and preference uncovering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored area of LLMs‚Äô ability for proactive collaboration with users holding unclear or dynamic goals.

Method: The study introduced UserBench, a benchmark with simulated users, designed for evaluating multi-turn, preference-driven interactions requiring goal clarification and tool use.

Result: The evaluation showed models align answers with all user intents only 20% of the time and uncover under 30% of user preferences on average.

Conclusion: There is a significant challenge in creating LLM agents that align deeply with user needs, and UserBench serves as a tool to measure and improve this capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Conclusion: This work signifies a breakthrough in generative AI for verification automation, offering effective solutions to critical bottleneck issues in chip design and paving the way for further exploration.

Abstract: As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is
attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these
technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation,
their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip

innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the
limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our
framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications
to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents,
including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code
implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of
varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms
traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in
verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench
generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI
applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective
approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the 'AI Social Gym', where AI learns through dialogs with teacher agents, inspired by Vygotsky's social learning theory. It shows dialogic learning improves AI knowledge acquisition better than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle to integrate and acquire complex knowledge dynamically. The study seeks to overcome these limitations by drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory to create more interactive and social learning paradigms.

Method: The 'AI Social Gym' environment was created, enabling AI agents to engage in structured pedagogical dialogues. Experimentation focused on the impact of various teaching strategies, including mixed-direction interactions that combined explanations and learner-driven questioning.

Result: Dialogic approaches, especially mixed-direction interactions, enhanced knowledge acquisition and application in LLMs better than traditional unidirectional or dataset-based methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating pedagogical methods inspired by human learning can improve AI models' post-training knowledge acquisition, offering an alternative approach to techniques like prompt engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

*David James Woo,Yangyang Yu,Kai Guo,Yilin Huang,April Ka Yeng Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how Hong Kong EFL secondary students use AI chatbot-generated content in their expository writing, focusing on their editing behaviors and the quality of their final compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the underexamined impact of AI chatbot-generated text on EFL students' expository writing processes, particularly how students edit and utilize such text to improve their writing.

Method: A workshop involving 39 Hong Kong secondary EFL students was organized. The students wrote expository compositions with AI chatbot assistance. Screen recordings, qualitative coding, descriptive statistics, temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze students' editing behaviors and composition quality.

Result: Two distinct editing patterns were identified: students either repeatedly refined introductory sections or quickly moved to extensive edits in the body content. The amount of AI-generated text positively correlated with higher composition scores, though most editing efforts had minimal impact on score improvements.

Conclusion: AI chatbot assistance supports but does not substitute the development of writing skills. The findings emphasize the need for genre-specific instruction, process-oriented writing exercises, and assessments that value both the writing process and the final output in AI-integrated writing contexts.

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

TL;DR: The paper critiques Floridi and Taddeo's "zero semantic commitment" approach to the grounding problem, evaluates Luc Steels' alternative, and argues for redefining the grounding problem with a focus on the behavioral ability and function of meaning in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the shortcomings of existing solutions to the grounding problem, including Floridi and Taddeo's condition, and to propose a rethinking of its conceptual foundation.

Method: The author critiques existing approaches, explores alternative views such as Luc Steels‚Äô approach, and develops an argument rooted in a proper understanding of computing to redefine the grounding problem.

Result: The analysis concludes that the key focus of the grounding problem should shift to explaining and reproducing the behavioral ability and function of meaning in artificial computational agents.

Conclusion: A re-conceptualization of the grounding problem is necessary, focusing on how artificial systems can display meaningful behavior rather than adhering to unattainable semantic commitments.

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [76] [ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21083)
*Franck Bardol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how emotional phrasing of prompts affects GPT-4 responses, revealing biases like a rebound effect and alignment override.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the implications of emotional framing on GPT-4's responses and uncover biases that may impact AI alignment and trust.

Method: 156 prompts spanning various topics were systematically modified in emotional tone, and responses were analyzed using metrics like tone-valence transition matrices and semantic embeddings.

Result: GPT-4 is less likely to respond negatively to emotionally negative prompts compared to neutral ones, with biases being even stronger for sensitive topics.

Conclusion: The study reveals emotional bias in GPT-4, highlighting its impact on semantic drift and alignment mechanisms in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

### [77] [Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084)
*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MNEME, a lightweight framework to detect and analyze side effects caused by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) without needing access to fine-tuning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to detect unintended negative side effects, such as performance degradation in unrelated tasks, stemming from fine-tuning or unlearning in LLMs, remains unaddressed.

Method: The paper proposes sparse model diffing using task-agnostic data to compare base and fine-tuned models, measuring behavioral shifts without relying on fine-tuning data.

Result: MNEME achieves up to 95% accuracy in identifying side effects in tests across multiple LLMs and fine-tuning scenarios, aligning with known benchmarks without requiring custom heuristics.

Conclusion: Sparse probing and diffing enable automated, scalable analysis of fine-tuning-induced behavioral changes in LLMs, offering practical tools for model management and understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [78] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), an advanced framework that enhances text generation by leveraging diverse amateur models to improve coherence, fluency, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Contrastive Decoding (CD) methods depend on a single amateur model, limiting their ability to address diverse failure modes like repetition and hallucination in language generation.

Method: MACD employs multiple amateur models, integrating their contrastive signals using averaging and consensus penalization. It also adapts the plausibility constraint for multi-amateur settings.

Result: Experimental results show MACD improves text generation quality, including fluency, coherence, and diversity, across multiple domains, outperforming CD and traditional decoding approaches.

Conclusion: MACD enriches open-ended text generation, demonstrating flexibility and quality improvements without requiring additional model training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for distinguishing subjective and objective sentences using a feature-augmented transformer model evaluated across multiple languages, achieving top results in several cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively detecting subjectivity in text across multiple languages, including under-resourced and unseen ones, in a diverse and multilingual setting.

Method: The study combines pre-trained contextual embeddings from language models with statistical and linguistic features. For Arabic, AraELECTRA was enhanced with POS tags and TF-IDF, while a cross-lingual DeBERTa V3 model with TF-IDF features via a gating mechanism was used for other languages. Monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot evaluations were conducted.

Result: The approach achieved strong performance, including: 1st place in monolingual English and Romanian tasks, 3rd in German, and 4th in Arabic. The method performed effectively in zero-shot settings, notably in linguistic transferability and feature-augmentation tests.

Conclusion: The combination of TF-IDF features, gating mechanisms, and cross-lingual fine-tuning significantly improves subjectivity detection. The system benefits from linguistic proximity and careful selection of training languages.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLM-based rewriting of ads improves visibility in retrieval systems without altering retrieval models. A supervised fine-tuning framework is introduced with novel metrics, showing improved results with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how the phrasing of content, specifically advertisements, impacts their visibility within retrieval-based Large Language Model (LLM) systems, an area underexplored despite advances in search algorithms and query relevance.

Method: The paper introduces a supervised fine-tuning framework that incorporates a custom loss function balancing semantic relevance and content fidelity. Evaluation metrics DeltaMRR@K and DeltaDIR@K are proposed to measure ranking improvement and inclusion frequency improvement, respectively.

Result: Experiments show that models trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperform prompt engineering and basic supervised fine-tuning. Achievements include a 2.79 improvement in DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 in DeltaMRR@5 in instruction-based prompting.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the critical role of ad phrasing and the significance of reinforcement learning in optimizing ad rewriting for improved performance in LLM-integrated retrieval systems.

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Motivation: To demonstrate how NLP and alternative data can enrich traditional insurance analytics and maintain competitiveness in the InsurTech era.

Method: By applying various NLP techniques to alternative data from an industry partner, the paper provides practical case studies for commercial insurance.

Result: NLP-derived insights improve traditional insurance pricing factors and introduce new industry classifications for assessing risks.

Conclusion: NLP plays a foundational role in modern insurance analytics, offering transformative benefits for actuarial analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and

InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

### [83] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a system to objectively measure Arabic rhetorical density in texts, using a compiled list of 84 literary devices, computational tools, and density calculations based on morpheme counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently no objective way to assess or compare Arabic rhetoric usage across genres, authors, or epochs, despite its significance in Arabic linguistics.

Method: The study compiled definitions of 84 literary devices, constructed a system to identify them, and devised a calculation method for their density. Tools, including online calculators, were created to support this evaluation.

Result: The study produced functional tools, including a website and an analogue tool, that can accurately calculate and report rhetorical device density and its distribution in Arabic texts.

Conclusion: The developed tools offer a novel, objective approach to analyzing Arabic rhetoric density, enhancing the study and comparison of Arabic literary traditions.

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Curved Inference,' a framework to track how the trajectory of a language model shifts in response to semantic changes, specifically analyzing curvature and salience in model activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how large language models (LLMs) adjust their internal processing when confronted with shifts in semantic concerns, such as emotional or moral considerations.

Method: The authors use five metrics, focusing on curvature and salience, alongside a semantic metric derived from the unembedding matrix to analyze how two language models‚ÄîGemma and LLaMA‚Äîalter their activation trajectories.

Result: The study finds that concern-shifted prompts lead to significant changes in the models' trajectories, with LLaMA showing consistent scaling in curvature and salience and Gemma showing weaker differentiation.

Conclusion: These results suggest that language models operate within a two-layer geometry: a latent conceptual space and a contextual trajectory space, providing a new way to evaluate their semantic abstraction and alignment capabilities.

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective and scalable method to integrate domain-specific knowledge into large language models for improved performance without extensive fine-tuning.

Method: The study employs semantic chunking using cosine similarity of sentence embeddings for efficient document segmentation and utilizes knowledge graph structuring for better retrieval accuracy and contextual insight.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior relevance and correctness of retrieved information from knowledge graphs using SemRAG compared to conventional RAG methods.

Conclusion: SemRAG provides an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution for creating domain-specific LLM pipelines, aligning with sustainability objectives and minimizing fine-tuning costs.

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the critical need to evaluate the domain-specific safety of large language models (LLMs), introducing Trident-Bench, a safety benchmark for legal, financial, and medical domains, while revealing consistent safety gaps among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are being deployed in high-stakes domains like law, finance, and medicine, but domain-specific safety risks have been neglected in prior research. This paper aims to address this gap by systematically evaluating these risks.

Method: The paper develops domain-specific safety principles from established ethical codes and introduces Trident-Bench, a benchmark designed to test LLM safety performance in legal, financial, and medical domains.

Result: By testing 19 generalist and domain-specialized LLMs with Trident-Bench, the authors observed that generalist models perform adequately in basic safety metrics, but domain-specific models struggle with complex ethical dilemmas, revealing substantial safety gaps.

Conclusion: The Trident-Bench benchmark serves as an effective resource for evaluating and addressing safety challenges in LLMs across high-stakes domains, laying the groundwork for improved ethical compliance and reduced risks in future LLM applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built
for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time
compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and
RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech

### [89] [Diverse LLMs or Diverse Question Interpretations? That is the Ensembling Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21168)
*Rafael Rosales,Santiago Miret*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares two diversity strategies‚Äîmodel diversity and question interpretation diversity‚Äîfor binary question answering using LLMs. Question interpretation diversity consistently outperforms model diversity in ensemble accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how different forms of diversity can be leveraged to improve large language models' accuracy in answering binary questions.

Method: Two strategies were evaluated: (1) model diversity by using multiple models for the same question, and (2) question interpretation diversity by reframing the question for a single model. Majority voting was applied as the consensus heuristic for both.

Result: Experiments on datasets (boolq, strategyqa, pubmedqa) reveal that question interpretation diversity yields better accuracy, while model diversity results remain inconsistent, ranging between worst and best ensemble members.

Conclusion: Question interpretation diversity is a more effective strategy than model diversity for enhancing ensemble accuracy in binary question answering tasks with LLMs.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartMark introduces a standardized grammar for chart annotations, separating semantics from implementation to enhance usability and cross-platform application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart annotations are fragmented and lack standardization, making cross-platform reuse and application challenging.

Method: ChartMark provides a hierarchical grammar framework that decouples annotation semantics from visualization implementation, targeting task, chart context, abstract intents, and visual details.

Result: The ChartMark toolkit successfully converts its specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, demonstrating versatility and applicability across contexts.

Conclusion: ChartMark's structured grammar enhances the accessibility and scalability of chart annotations, promoting standardization and broader usage.

Abstract: Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from
fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.
We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics
from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework
mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both
abstract intents and precise visual details. Our toolkit demonstrates
converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting
its flexibility, expressiveness, and practical applicability.

### [91] [Contrast-CAT: Contrasting Activations for Enhanced Interpretability in Transformer-based Text Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21186)
*Sungmin Han,Jeonghyun Lee,Sangkyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Contrast-CAT, a method to improve interpretability in transformer-based text classification by filtering out irrelevant features from activation-based attributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While transformers are powerful, their opaque decision-making, especially for simple tasks like classification, hampers trust and safe use in real-world applications.

Method: Contrast-CAT contrasts activation sequences with reference activations to eliminate class-irrelevant features, resulting in clearer and more reliable interpretations.

Result: Contrast-CAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in MoRF evaluations and metrics like AOPC and LOdds on various datasets and models.

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT effectively enhances the interpretability of transformer-based text classification, making their decisions more trustworthy and deployable.

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

TL;DR: This paper presents a sentiment analysis of Bangla social media comments using a transformer-based model to classify sentiment into positive, negative, and neutral categories, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze dynamic public sentiment shifts on crime-related news shared in Bangla on social media platforms and to address sentiment analysis in low-resource languages.

Method: A new dataset of 28,528 Bangla social media comments was curated. The study used a transformer-based model with the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture for sentiment classification, combined with explainable AI to understand influential features.

Result: The proposed model achieved a high classification accuracy of 97% in sentiment analysis, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods for Bangla sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models are effective for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages like Bangla, offering valuable insights for public policy and crime prevention strategies.

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

*Mohammad Mehadi Hasan,Fatema Binte Hassan,Md Al Jubair,Zobayer Ahmed,Sazzatul Yeakin,Md Masum Billah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper enhances Bangla BERT for detecting hyperpartisan news in Bangla, achieving 95.65% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misinformation in Bangla, a low-resource language, where hyperpartisan news detection methods are lacking.

Method: Fine-tuning Bangla BERT and comparing its performance with traditional machine learning models while incorporating semi-supervised learning and LIME for transparency.

Result: Bangla BERT achieved a high classification accuracy of 95.65%, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models like Bangla BERT are effective for hyperpartisan news detection, even in low-resource settings, paving the way for advancements in this domain.

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

*Christoph Metzner,Shang Gao,Drahomira Herrmannova,Heidi A. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzed whether clinical rationales enhance the performance and explainability of transformer models for classifying clinical text, finding limited benefits compared to simply using more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if incorporating human-labeled clinical rationales can both improve the performance and explainability of transformer-based models for clinical text classification.

Method: The study compared transformer-based models trained with 99,125 human-based clinical rationales and 128,649 pathology reports, analyzing the impact of integrating rationale-based supervision and evaluating rationale quality using sufficiency metrics.

Result: Using clinical rationales improved model performance in high-resource settings but demonstrated inconsistent behavior in limited-resource scenarios. Models trained on additional reports consistently outperformed models trained on rationales, and sufficiency metrics for selecting rationales yielded inconsistent outcomes.

Conclusion: Training transformer-based models on clinical rationales yields minor performance gains and slightly better explainability but is overshadowed by the benefits of using more annotated reports. Efforts should prioritize labeling more reports for accuracy rather than creating rationales, except when explainability is the focus.

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

### [95] [Do Large Language Models Understand Morality Across Cultures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21319)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Yasmeen F. S. S. Meijer,Efthymia Papadopoulou,Ayoub Bagheri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study assesses the biases in large language models (LLMs), particularly their limitations in capturing cross-cultural moral variations based on international survey data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore how well LLMs align with cross-cultural moral perspectives and address concerns about embedded biases in their functioning.

Method: Three methods were employed: comparing variance in moral scores with survey data, cluster alignment analyses, and direct probing using selected token pairs.

Result: LLMs demonstrated low alignment with empirical moral survey patterns and compressed cross-cultural differences, highlighting representativeness issues.

Conclusion: More robust strategies are crucial to mitigate biases and enhance cultural representativeness for ethical and fair global deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Motivation: The study aimed to address challenges in Shona ASR such as limited training data, lack of labeled resources, and tonal complexities.

Method: The method combined CNN for acoustic modeling and LSTM for language modeling, incorporating data augmentation, transfer learning, and attention mechanisms.

Result: The system achieved a Word Error Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and overall accuracy of 74%, demonstrating significant improvement.

Conclusion: Deep learning showed potential for enhancing ASR technology for under-resourced languages and contributed to increased accessibility for Shona speakers.

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

*Satyananda Kashyap,Sola Shirai,Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces StructText, a framework to automatically generate benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using tabular data, addressing the lack of existing benchmarks for LLM evaluation and the high cost of manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on key-value extraction from text in specific domains, which is essential for enterprise applications.

Method: The proposed framework, StructText, employs a two-stage 'plan-then-execute' pipeline that synthetically generates text from tabular data and includes a multi-dimensional evaluation approach combining LLM-based judgments and objective extraction metrics.

Result: StructText was tested on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets, showing that LLMs are strong in factuality and avoiding hallucination but struggle with narrative coherence, embedding valuable information in ways that resist automated extraction.

Conclusion: StructText improves the scalability of benchmark generation for key-value extraction and reveals both the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in this area, providing resources for further research and development.

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

*Xiyue Zhu,Peng Tang,Haofu Liao,Srikar Appalaraju*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a web history compressor to improve web automation by focusing on task-relevant data from history states, yielding accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web automation methods neglect the significance of history states, which are verbose and lead to efficiency issues.

Method: The authors introduce a history compressor module for extracting task-relevant information from verbose history states and representing them succinctly.

Result: Experiments on Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets show an accuracy improvement of 1.2-5.4% over methods without history inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed history compressor enhances web automation performance by leveraging compressed representations of history states.

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemTool introduces a short-term memory framework for LLM agents to handle tool and MCP server contexts efficiently in multi-turn conversations, with three proposed operational modes evaluated across multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of fixed context windows in multi-turn interactions where LLMs need to repeatedly and independently utilize tools or MCP servers.

Method: Three operational modes (Autonomous Agent Mode, Workflow Mode, and Hybrid Mode) were proposed and tested across 13+ LLMs using the ScaleMCP benchmark over 100 user interactions.

Result: Autonomous Agent Mode achieved high tool removal efficiency for reasoning LLMs (90-94%), while medium-sized models performed poorly (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes demonstrated consistently effective tool management, with task completion excelling in Autonomous and Hybrid modes.

Conclusion: MemTool offers effective solutions for tool management in multi-turn conversations, with trade-offs depending on model size, task accuracy, agency, and operational preferences.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM specifically developed for travel mode choice prediction, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and model interpretability compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the application of locally deployable causal LLMs for predicting travel mode choices and to address the need for interpretable, privacy-respecting, and specialized tools in transportation research.

Method: The study systematically benchmarks eleven LLMs across datasets, fine-tunes LiTransMC using parameter-efficient strategies, and employs topic modeling (BERTopic) along with the Explanation Strength Index to evaluate reasoning.

Result: LiTransMC achieved a high weighted F1 score (0.6845) and near-perfect distributional calibration metrics, outperforming both untuned LLMs, proprietary models like GPT-4o, and traditional prediction methods.

Conclusion: LiTransMC demonstrates the feasibility of fine-tuned, locally deployable LLMs to integrate prediction with interpretability, paving the way for specialized conversational models in transportation research while ensuring privacy and cost reductions.

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

TL;DR: HumorBench, a humor comprehension benchmark for large language models (LLMs), evaluates their ability to reason and explain cartoon captions. It uses 300 annotated examples to analyze model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test LLMs' reasoning abilities beyond STEM domains by focusing on humor comprehension, which involves concept connections and cultural references.

Method: HumorBench uses 300 curated cartoon-caption pairs with expert annotations. Models are assessed on how they explain humor and identify joke elements.

Result: Key findings: (1) LLMs transfer STEM reasoning skills effectively to humor; (2) STEM-trained models perform well on HumorBench; (3) Increasing thinking token budgets has mixed impacts on humor reasoning.

Conclusion: HumorBench highlights the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in humor and underscores the transferability of their skills across domains.

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

*Abhinav Arabelly,Jagrut Nemade,Robert D Nowak,Jifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel sampling strategy to reduce annotation costs for supervised finetuning of large language models, achieving better or comparable results with lower computational and data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high annotation costs, time investment, and labor intensity in creating high-performing models for specific applications, the paper seeks to develop a more efficient data selection strategy for supervised finetuning.

Method: The method leverages task-diversity instead of prompt-diversity for data selection, using an inverse confidence weighting strategy to sample training examples across tasks. It utilizes readily available task labels and variability in model confidence across tasks.

Result: The proposed method achieves better accuracy (e.g., 4% increase in MMLU score) compared to full-dataset training and consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across different annotation budgets. It also reduces annotation costs by up to 80%.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a task-diversity-based approach, combined with inverse confidence weighting, is a simple, effective, and resource-efficient strategy for label-efficient learning in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VN-MTEB, a Vietnamese benchmark for text embedding models, addressing the lack of large-scale test datasets in Vietnamese by translating English samples using advanced frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to Vietnam's high online toxicity and internet traffic, there is a need for robust embedding models for recommendation and content control. The absence of large-scale, diverse test datasets hinders effective AI model evaluation.

Method: The authors utilized large language models and advanced embedding models to translate and filter English datasets, ensuring high-quality samples with semantic fidelity. They preserved elements like named entities and code snippets and compiled a benchmark of 41 Vietnamese datasets from six tasks.

Result: Analysis revealed that embedding models with Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding for Vietnamese texts. The benchmark datasets are publicly available on HuggingFace.

Conclusion: VN-MTEB provides a valuable resource for evaluating Vietnamese text embedding models, addressing dataset limitations and advancing tools for recommendation and content control applications in Vietnam.

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models may develop unintended personality traits, and understanding these variations is essential for building reliable and safe systems.

Method: The authors analyze the model's activation space to identify 'persona vectors' representing specific traits, then use these vectors to monitor, predict, and control personality shifts post-training.

Result: They demonstrate that personality changes strongly correlate with shifts in persona vectors, and propose interventions and preventative methods to mitigate undesirable traits. They also show that persona vectors can flag problematic training data.

Conclusion: Persona vectors offer an effective way to assess, control, and guide personality traits in language models, ensuring better alignment with intended behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

### [105] [Model-free Speculative Decoding for Transformer-based ASR with Token Map Drafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21522)
*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token Map Drafting, a model-free speculative decoding technique for enhancing the efficiency of transformer-based ASR systems, offering speed-ups without compromising transcription accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottlenecks of autoregressive decoding in transformer-based ASR systems on devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs.

Method: Token Map Drafting utilizes a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific data for speculative decoding, removing the need for a separate draft model.

Result: The approach accelerated ASR inference by 1.27√ó on CI-AVSR and 1.37√ó on the internal dataset, without degrading transcription accuracy.

Conclusion: The technique effectively improves decoding efficiency for structured, low-perplexity ASR applications, particularly on CPU-based and resource-limited devices.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

### [106] [TriangleMix: A Lossless and Efficient Attention Pattern for Long Context Prefilling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21526)
*Zhiyuan He,Yike Zhang,Chengruidong Zhang,Huiqiang Jiang,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TriangleMix, a training-free static sparse attention mechanism, to improve efficiency in LLMs without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational bottlenecks in attention mechanisms of LLMs, especially for long sequences, caused by high time complexity or additional overhead from dynamic sparsity methods.

Method: A novel attention pattern called TriangleMix, utilizing dense attention in shallow layers and a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers, reducing attention computation overhead.

Result: TriangleMix accelerates attention computation by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers and reduces total Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32%, while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: TriangleMix significantly boosts efficiency in LLMs and can complement dynamic sparsity methods for further improvements, showcasing promise in optimizing inference for long sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

*Meet Bhatt,Nic Boilard,Muhammad Rehan Chaudhary,Cole Thompson,Jacob Idoko,Aakash Sorathiya,Gouri Ginde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reproducibility of a previous deep learning-based NLP study for requirements classification and explores performance improvements using external datasets and machine learning models, including GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited attention given to replicating NLP applications in requirements engineering and explore advancements in NLP tools for machine-assisted workflows.

Method: The study replicated a previous NLP4RE research using released source code, extended its setup on external datasets, compared deep learning model results with GPT-4o classifiers, and created replication readiness tools.

Result: The study observed mixed reproducibility among models, with Naive Bayes being perfectly reproducible. BERT and ELMo demonstrated strong generalization on external datasets, while GPT-4o performed comparably to baseline models.

Conclusion: The baseline study was largely replicable, showing good generalization and performance, but replication readiness could be improved further through additional environment setup details.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study developed a new dependency annotation framework tailored for Uyghur, addressing limitations in existing treebanks for the agglutinative and low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical gap in resources for Uyghur Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in dependency annotations.

Method: The authors created a dependency framework with 18 main relations and 26 subtypes, validated through cross-standard evaluations using a Universal Dependencies parser.

Result: Analysis found a 47.9% divergence in annotations, confirming the inadequacy of universal schemes for Uyghur structures.

Conclusion: The introduced Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank improves semantic transparency and parsing, and serves as a model for other complex languages.

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

*Jungyeon Lee,Kangmin Lee,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores knowledge conflict in retrieval-augmented generation systems and introduces a new KG-based framework (MAGIC) to benchmark system performance, revealing challenges in conflict detection and multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks for knowledge conflict in RAG systems, which focus narrowly on question answering, rely on entity substitution, and fail to cover a broad range of conflict types.

Method: The authors propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that introduces varied and nuanced conflicts between similar contexts, ensuring clarity through KGs' explicit relational structures.

Result: Experimental findings on the new benchmark MAGIC show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with conflict detection, especially requiring multi-hop reasoning, and fail to accurately identify the source of contradictions.

Conclusion: The paper provides foundational insights to improve LLMs' abilities to integrate diverse and conflicting information, suggesting directions for further development.

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

### [110] [Evaluating the cognitive reality of Spanish irregular morphomic patterns: Humans vs. Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21556)
*Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao,Kevin Tang,Dinah Baer-Henney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares transformer-based neural networks to human behavior in processing Spanish irregular morphomic patterns and finds that while models excel in accuracy, they diverge in response preferences and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if transformer-based models replicate human-like sensitivity to morphomic patterns in linguistics, specifically Spanish irregular patterns.

Method: The study evaluates transformer models using controlled input conditions and human-like experiments, testing them under natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency verb distributions.

Result: Models surpassed humans in accuracy but showed distinct response preferences, favoring irregular responses and being influenced by training data proportions.

Conclusion: Transformer models, though effective, differ from humans in handling complex linguistic phenomena, emphasizing the gap between computational and human linguistic cognition.

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

*Aar√≥n Galiano-Jim√©nez,Juan Antonio P√©rez-Ortiz,Felipe S√°nchez-Mart√≠nez,V√≠ctor M. S√°nchez-Cartagena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a sequence-level knowledge distillation method for multilingual translation models, leveraging multiple translations to better represent teacher model distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve sequence-level knowledge distillation in multilingual pre-trained translation models by addressing limitations of using single outputs and enhancing exposure to diverse target-side prefixes.

Method: The authors introduce Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a method that utilizes $n$-best lists from beam search or alternative decoding methods to expose the student model to a broader range of translations and mitigate bias.

Result: The proposed MHD method provides better student model performance in low-resource languages, improves corpus variability and lexical richness, and reduces gender bias amplification.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using diverse decoding methods, such as sampling, to improve the generalization and mitigate biases in knowledge distillation for low-resource multilingual translation models.

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Libra Bench, a reasoning-oriented benchmark for assessing reward models in complex reasoning tasks, along with Libra-RM, a generative reward model using learning-to-think methodologies that excels across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL reward models face challenges in reasoning tasks due to dependence on annotated answers and constrained output formats, limiting their scalability and performance.

Method: The paper creates Libra Bench, a benchmark for reasoning tasks, and uses learning-to-think methodologies to develop Libra-RM, a generative reward model optimized for reasoning.

Result: Libra-RM achieves state-of-the-art results on reasoning benchmarks, while experiments confirm the correlation between Libra Bench and downstream applications.

Conclusion: Libra Bench and Libra-RM provide effective solutions for improving reasoning performance in RL models without relying on annotated data, enabling better scalability and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

*Raj Vardhan Tomar,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UnsafeChain, a dataset targeting hard prompts that lead to unsafe outputs, aiming to improve the safety alignment of large reasoning models by guiding them toward corrected safe responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus primarily on filtering prompts to ensure safe outputs without addressing the underlying issue of hard prompts consistently eliciting harmful responses.

Method: UnsafeChain employs a correction-based supervision approach by exposing models to unsafe completions and explicitly guiding them toward safe corrections.

Result: Fine-tuning models on UnsafeChain yields superior safety performance and generalizability across benchmarks compared to prior datasets like SafeChain and STAR-1.

Conclusion: UnsafeChain effectively enhances the safety of LRMs while maintaining their reasoning abilities and establishes a robust correction-based framework for safety alignment.

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Yizhi Li,Stuart E. Middleton,Noura Al Moubayed,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simple module to increase the adversarial robustness of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by removing specific components of embeddings, improving robustness with minimal computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, threatening their usability in real-world applications. Existing solutions to enhance robustness often come with significant computational costs, making them less efficient.

Method: The authors propose an add-on module that removes instance-level principal components from embeddings, aligning distributions to approximate Gaussian properties. This minimizes the impact of adversarial noise without modifying the original training data or using costly adversarial defenses.

Result: The proposed method improves adversarial robustness across eight benchmark datasets while maintaining comparable pre-attack accuracy to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the method achieves a better trade-off between robustness and generalization, offering a computationally efficient solution for enhancing PLM robustness without data augmentation or adversarial examples.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Motivation: To address the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in the agricultural domain.

Method: Created AgriEval, a benchmark featuring 17,000+ curated questions from university-level sources, covering six major agricultural categories and four cognitive scenarios, tested on 51 LLMs.

Result: Most LLMs underperformed with less than 60% accuracy in AgriEval, highlighting significant room for improvement in agricultural domain-specific LLMs.

Conclusion: AgriEval sets a robust foundation for developing and improving LLMs in agriculture, providing meaningful insights and strategies for enhancement.

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

*Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the robustness of safety classification models for LLMs in addressing multilingual disparities and highlights issues in evaluation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on evaluating multilingual safety classification effectiveness for LLMs and improve safety measures.

Method: The study evaluates 5 multilingual safety classification models using datasets in 18 languages to uncover disparities and issues.

Result: Multilingual disparities are identified in the safety classification models, along with shortcomings in evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: Better evaluation methods and safety classification approaches are needed to handle harmful content across diverse languages effectively.

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HRIPBench, a benchmark dataset to evaluate large language models (LLMs) accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction information for substance use. Evaluation reveals significant accuracy and safety limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing need to provide accurate and safe harm reduction information to people who use drugs (PWUD), given the widespread challenges of substance use on well-being. The potential capability of LLMs for addressing medical knowledge gaps in this context drives the investigation.

Method: The authors developed HRIPBench, a benchmark containing 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs, focusing on three critical tasks: safety boundary checks, quantitative value provision, and polysubstance use risk inference. They employed Instruction and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) schemes for evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art large language models were found to struggle in delivering accurate harm reduction information and, at times, posed significant safety risks to users.

Conclusion: LLMs are insufficiently reliable for harm reduction contexts and may lead to negative health outcomes. Their application in such situations must be cautiously constrained to protect the well-being of users.

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper

### [120] [Modelling Adjectival Modification Effects on Semantic Plausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21828)
*Anna Golub,Beate Zywietz,Annerose Eichel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates event plausibility changes triggered by adjectival modifications, using the ADEPT challenge benchmark. It evaluates sentence transformers and other models, finding performance struggles and impactful imbalances in the evaluation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding plausibility shifts in event modifications is critical for applications like dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection.

Method: The authors assess models using the ADEPT challenge benchmark (16K sentence pairs with single adjectival modifications) and evaluate performances of sentence transformers and transformer-based models.

Result: Transformer-based models, including sentence transformers, faced challenges with the task. Surprisingly, sentence transformers underperformed compared to models like RoBERTa. Imbalanced evaluation methods significantly influenced outcomes.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for balanced evaluation practices since imbalances negatively affect model performance metrics and reliability, despite novel attempts in modeling plausibility changes.

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

### [121] [Introducing HALC: A general pipeline for finding optimal prompting strategies for automated coding with LLMs in the computational social sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21831)
*Andreas Reich,Claudia Thoms,Tobias Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HALC, a pipeline for creating optimal prompts for coding tasks with LLMs, tested across over two million requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the systematic creation of prompts and reduce trial-and-error practices in LLM-based task automation, especially for social science coding.

Method: The paper develops and validates HALC by testing it through 1,512 prompts and more than two million requests using expert codings as benchmarks.

Result: Specific prompts were identified as reliably coding single and dual variables with good agreement on the model Mistral NeMo.

Conclusion: HALC effectively supports the generation of reliable prompts for any coding task or model, providing key insights for optimizing prompting strategies.

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

### [122] [AutoTIR: Autonomous Tools Integrated Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21836)
*Yifan Wei,Xiaoyan Yu,Yixuan Weng,Tengfei Pan,Angsheng Li,Li Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoTIR introduces a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs, allowing adaptive and optimized tool usage during reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIR methods employ fixed, predefined tool-use strategies, limiting adaptability and risking degradation of language competence.

Method: AutoTIR employs reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward mechanism optimizing task-specific correctness, structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage.

Result: Extensive evaluations show AutoTIR's superior performance across diverse tasks, surpassing baselines and exhibiting advanced tool-use generalization.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can create more generalizable and scalable Tool-Integrated Reasoning capabilities in LLMs, as demonstrated by AutoTIR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

### [123] [Graph-R1: Towards Agentic GraphRAG Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21892)
*Haoran Luo,Haihong E,Guanting Chen,Qika Lin,Yikai Guo,Fangzhi Xu,Zemin Kuang,Meina Song,Xiaobao Wu,Yifan Zhu,Luu Anh Tuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-R1 improves over existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods by introducing a lightweight hypergraph construction and optimizing retrieval interactions using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in RAG such as high graph construction costs, one-time retrieval limitations, and dependencies on long-context reasoning and prompt design.

Method: Graph-R1 employs an agentic framework with lightweight hypergraph construction, models retrieval as interactive iterations, and applies end-to-end reinforcement learning for optimization.

Result: Graph-R1 achieves superior reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality compared to traditional GraphRAG and RL-augmented RAG.

Conclusion: Graph-R1 demonstrates significant advantages in improving retrieval and generation in RAG frameworks, offering an efficient and effective solution to existing challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

### [124] [Rote Learning Considered Useful: Generalizing over Memorized Data in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21914)
*Qinyuan Wu,Soumi Das,Mahsa Amani,Bishwamittra Ghosh,Mohammad Aflah Khan,Krishna P. Gummadi,Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-phase framework enabling LLMs to generalize from rote-memorized data and explore its applications and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common belief that rote learning hinders generalization, especially in training AI models.

Method: The proposed memorize-then-generalize framework first involves rote memorization with semantically meaningless tokens, followed by fine-tuning using meaningful prompts.

Result: Experiments across 8 LLMs reveal that models can reinterpret rote data and derive structured, aligned latent representations through the framework.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates efficient knowledge injection into LLMs, raising possibilities for beneficial applications and risks from malicious use of memorized data.

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

### [125] [Training language models to be warm and empathetic makes them less reliable and more sycophantic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21919)
*Lujain Ibrahim,Franziska Sofia Hafner,Luc Rocher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study demonstrates a trade-off where training language models to be warm and empathetic decreases their reliability, especially in safety-critical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing demand for empathetic AI systems used for advice and companionship and investigates how this optimization impacts their reliability.

Method: Researchers conducted controlled experiments on five language models with varying sizes and architectures, training them for warmth and empathy, and testing their performance on safety-critical tasks.

Result: Warmer models had significantly higher error rates, including promoting misinformation, validating false beliefs, and offering unsafe medical advice, especially when users expressed sadness.

Conclusion: The findings highlight systematic risks in optimizing models for warmth, revealing a need for reevaluating development and oversight methods for AI systems being widely deployed.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

*Carel van Niekerk,Renato Vukovic,Benjamin Matthias Ruppik,Hsien-chin Lin,Milica Ga≈°iƒá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF) proposes a method for improving Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning and calibration using their own confidence as feedback, rather than relying on external labels or rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate answers that seem plausible but are poorly calibrated, affecting reliability in reasoning tasks.

Method: RLSF uses the LLM's own confidence as an intrinsic reward by generating solutions, calculating confidence for final answers, and creating synthetic preferences to fine-tune the model via preference optimization, similar to RLHF but without human or external input.

Result: RLSF improves the model's probability estimates and enhances step-by-step reasoning, leading to better performance on arithmetic reasoning and multiple-choice tasks.

Conclusion: RLSF demonstrates that intrinsic rewards like model uncertainty can be effectively leveraged for post-training in LLMs, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient reinforcement learning approach worthy of further study.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

### [127] [Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934)
*Tianyi Hu,Andrea Morales-Garz√≥n,Jingyi Zheng,Maria Maistro,Daniel Hershcovich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents CARRIAGE, a novel RAG-based framework for generating diverse cross-cultural recipe adaptations, addressing the lack of diversity in current RAG outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge in cross-cultural recipe adaptation of generating culturally appropriate, diverse outputs that address varying dietary needs and preferences. Existing RAG approaches fail at leveraging contextual input diversity for creative tasks.

Method: The authors propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play framework enhancing diversity in both retrieval and context organization within the RAG paradigm, specifically for cross-cultural recipe adaptation.

Result: CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency, balancing both diversity and quality of recipe adaptations, outperforming closed-book LLMs in this context.

Conclusion: CARRIAGE effectively resolves the RAG limitation of low diversity in creative tasks, marking it as the first RAG framework explicitly designed for generating diverse outputs in recipe adaptation.

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

### [128] [Predicting Microbial Ontology and Pathogen Risk from Environmental Metadata with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21980)
*Hyunwoo Yoo,Gail L. Rosen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for microbiome classification and pathogen risk prediction from metadata, showing superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning models struggle with generalization in microbiome studies, especially with small samples, heterogeneous label formats, and metadata-only scenarios.

Method: The paper evaluates LLMs like ChatGPT-4o and others in zero-shot and few-shot settings across real-world datasets, comparing them to traditional models such as Random Forests.

Result: LLMs outperform traditional methods in ontology classification and show strong predictive abilities for pathogen contamination risk, generalizing across different metadata distributions.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective at reasoning over sparse and heterogeneous metadata, presenting a promising metadata-only solution for microbiology and biosurveillance.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

*Minghao Guo,Qingcheng Zeng,Xujiang Zhao,Yanchi Liu,Wenchao Yu,Mengnan Du,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSieve is a framework enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by decomposing queries and selectively routing them to suitable sources for improved reasoning and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with dynamic and knowledge-intensive queries due to limited access to external, domain-specific, or up-to-date information, and existing RAG methods lack fine-tuned query and retrieval control.

Method: DeepSieve breaks down queries into sub-questions, routes them to appropriate knowledge sources, and filters out irrelevant data through a multi-stage distillation process, leveraging modular and agentic design principles.

Result: DeepSieve demonstrates superior performance in multi-hop reasoning tasks by improving transparency, retrieval accuracy, and reasoning depth compared to traditional RAG approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more precise, adaptable, and interpretable method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset combining raw IMU and motion capture data for physiotherapeutic and gait analysis, promoting machine learning applications in movement evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for large, diverse datasets to develop robust sensor-based models, as collecting them is challenging, expensive, and time-consuming.

Method: Participants' movement data was recorded using synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture systems, while providing processed outputs, annotations, and tools for analysis.

Result: They produced a multimodal dataset containing IMU and optical marker data with precise alignments and annotations to support varied analysis and model development.

Conclusion: The dataset and accompanying tools can accelerate machine learning research in human movement analysis, improving exercise evaluation, gait analysis, and biomechanics.

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

TL;DR: BF-PIP is a zero-shot approach for predicting pedestrian intentions in autonomous driving, leveraging continuous video clips and JAAD metadata to outperform GPT-4V methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance spatiotemporal perception for autonomous driving by addressing limitations of supervised learning approaches requiring extensive retraining.

Method: BF-PIP uses short, continuous video clips and structured JAAD metadata, incorporating bounding-box and ego-vehicle speed through multimodal prompts without additional training.

Result: BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction accuracy, outperforming GPT-4V by 18%.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal video inputs with contextual cues in BF-PIP enables more robust and retraining-free pedestrian intention prediction for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable precise and practical chart editing by combining natural language and visual cues, overcoming limitations of existing approaches relying solely on ambiguous natural language instructions.

Method: Developed ChartM3 benchmark with multimodal instructions and multi-level editing complexity, alongside a training dataset (ChartM3-Train) with multimodal editing samples to fine-tune models.

Result: ChartM3 reveals significant shortcomings in current multimodal large language models. Fine-tuning with the ChartM3-Train dataset substantially enhances model performance in chart editing tasks.

Conclusion: Multimodal supervision combining natural language and visual indicators is crucial for advancing practical chart editing systems. The new benchmark and training dataset pave the way for improvements in explaining and refining charts.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

TL;DR: This paper develops a GAN to generate dental panoramic radiographs, addressing data scarcity in dental research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to tackle the limited availability of dental radiograph data used for research and education.

Method: A DCGAN using Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) was trained on 2322 dental radiographs, focusing on the dentoalveolar region, with preprocessing and data standardization.

Result: Generated images were evaluated by a clinical expert for anatomical visibility and realism. Non-denoised data models captured finer details, while denoised data models provided clearer, sharper images.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for leveraging GANs in dental imaging, balancing detail and clarity in image generation.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [134] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of explaining how Deep Neural Networks integrate visual, language, and knowledge for caption generation, proposing a novel framework based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks, which offers insights into training data influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the interpretability problems in multimodal DNN models, particularly in understanding how these models generate meaningful captions by combining various modalities.

Method: The authors propose a framework using Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) to aggregate symbolic rules and real-valued functions. The approach analyzes distribution shifts over training entries conditioned by the generated captions to identify influential examples.

Result: The experiments conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate this framework's capability to explain caption generation processes, enabling a comparison of state-of-the-art captioning models based on interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a novel method to interpret caption generation and highlights the benefits of explainable AI, establishing a dimension for evaluating DNN-based captioning models beyond standard metrics.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach using semi-supervised learning (SSL) for spatial-temporal action localization, showcasing improved performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the benefits of SSL, which has been largely applied to image classification, to spatial-temporal action localization where annotations are more challenging to obtain.

Method: The authors introduce a dual guidance network that utilizes a combination of frame-level classification and bounding-box prediction to enhance action class consistency across frames and improve pseudo-bounding box selection.

Result: Experiments on spatial-temporal action localization datasets, including UCF101-24, J-HMDB-21, and AVA, demonstrate significant performance gains compared to image-based SSL extensions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts SSL techniques to a novel domain, achieving superior results and proving its effectiveness in limited labeled data scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an augmented dataset approach to optimize small object detection in aerial wildlife tracking, analyzing the impact of patching configurations using diverse object detection architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve aerial wildlife tracking, which faces challenges due to the cost and risks of human-piloted aircraft, limited computational power on drones, and the difficulty of detecting small ground objects in images.

Method: The method involves dataset patching augmentation and a comparative study of three diverse object detectors. Statistical analyses are conducted to evaluate detection accuracy under various patching hyperparameters.

Result: Each of the three models achieved at least 93% mAP@IoU=0.5 in at least one patching configuration, demonstrating the efficiency of simpler models for limited patch scales while retaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Simpler, faster object detection models can perform as well as computationally heavier ones in limited settings, making them suitable for UAV-based aerial wildlife tracking. Datasets and models are shared publicly.

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [137] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes novel methods for HDR environment map estimation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), addressing issues like pole distortion and border seams through ERP convolutional padding and a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve HDR environment map estimation from single-view images, focusing on overcoming issues of pole distortions and seams in the commonly used ERP representation.

Method: The study introduces ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder to remove border seams and a specially designed PanoDiT network (panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer) to better handle the ERP format.

Result: The proposed methods reduce ERP distortions and artefacts, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of image quality and lighting accuracy, although with some trade-offs in plausibility.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates advancements in HDR environment map estimation, particularly in reducing artefacts and improving lighting accuracy, while highlighting a trade-off between distortion reduction and image plausibility.

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

### [138] [Fairness and Robustness of CLIP-Based Models for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21291)
*Th√©o Sourget,David Restrepo,C√©line Hudelot,Enzo Ferrante,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the fairness and robustness of six CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification, revealing performance discrepancies across patient demographics and dependence on spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the fairness and robustness of adapted CLIP-based models in radiology, especially given the lack of exploration in these areas despite strong performance in image-text tasks.

Method: Six CLIP-based models were extensively tested using three datasets‚ÄîMIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. Fairness was assessed across age, sex, and race subgroups, alongside robustness evaluated through pneumothorax cases with/without chest drains.

Result: Performance gaps were observed across age groups, equitable results for other attributes, and reliance on spurious correlations (chest drains). Sensitive attributes could be classified from embeddings; PCA lacked effectiveness for visualizing patterns.

Conclusion: Much work remains in improving fairness and avoiding shortcut learning in CLIP-based medical models. Visualization techniques like PCA are insufficient for understanding embedding vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code

*Martin de La Gorce,Charlie Hewitt,Tibor Takacs,Robert Gerdisch,Zafiirah Hosenie,Givi Meishvili,Marek Kowalski,Thomas J. Cashman,Antonio Criminisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time method for creating 3D representations from 2D webcam feeds, enhancing authenticity and stability for virtual meetings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in creating realistic 3D representations for virtual meetings without requiring complex hardware or compromises in quality.

Method: A method to predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions from 2D webcam feeds, conditioned on each video frame for authenticity, and introducing a stability loss for temporally stable outputs.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability, enabling realistic 3D videoconferencing using standard 2D cameras and displays.

Conclusion: The approach allows accessible, realistic, and authentic 3D communication, bridging the gap in current 3D videoconferencing solutions.

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

*Feixiang Zhou,Zhuangzhi Gao,He Zhao,Jianyang Xie,Yanda Meng,Yitian Zhao,Gregory Y. H. Lip,Yalin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for improving the segmentation of tubular structures by addressing both global topology and local discontinuities, achieving superior accuracy in 2D and 3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tubular structure segmentation is crucial in medical applications, but structural fragmentation often compromises segmentation quality and downstream utility.

Method: The proposed GLCP framework integrates an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation module to jointly learn global, skeleton, and local discontinuity maps, and a Dual-Attention-based Refinement module for enhancing map quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superior segmentation accuracy and continuity compared to state-of-the-art techniques on 2D and 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The GLCP framework effectively preserves both global and local characteristics of tubular networks, addressing fragmentation challenges and improving medical segmentation applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

*Monika Shah,Sudarshan Balaji,Somdeb Sarkhel,Sanorita Dey,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates if Vision Language Models (VLMs) can handle violations of Grice's conversational maxims, revealing performance issues when questions are modified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the sensitivity and limitations of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in handling modified questions within the framework of Grice's cooperative conversation principles.

Method: The study modifies human-crafted questions with additional modifiers and tests the performance of three state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Flash) using the VQA v2.0 dataset.

Result: The findings show that the performance of VLMs consistently decreases as questions are made more complex by adding modifiers.

Conclusion: The research suggests that current VLMs struggle to handle conversational subtlety introduced by modifiers, indicating an opportunity for further improvements in their conversational robustness.

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

*Amirmohammad Shamaei,Alexander Stebner,Salome,Bosshart,Johanna Ospel,Gouri Ginde,Mariana Bento,Roberto Souza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deep-learning framework for faster and improved MRI reconstruction, significantly reducing processing time and enhancing segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scans have high acquisition times, raising costs and diminishing patient comfort. Leveraging subject-specific prior scans using deep learning can improve reconstruction quality but suffers from time-intensive registration processes.

Method: The method includes a deep-learning-based framework with three components: an initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a transformer-based enhancement network.

Result: Results show improved MRI reconstruction quality across multiple acceleration factors, better segmentation accuracy, and reduced processing times compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for clinical applications, combining speed, accuracy, and real-time viability; its associated code is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using limited examples, combining efficient tuning approaches and innovative techniques for task-relevant feature augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the study lies in addressing the challenge of overfitting and mismatch between scene-level pre-training in large Video-Language Models (VLMs) and the need for specific person-centric understanding during action detection with limited examples.

Method: The authors introduced a method combining LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning and learnable internal feature augmentations, applied in the frozen VLM backbone using FiLM. They also proposed a group-weighted loss function to prioritize informative augmentations based on their prediction divergence.

Result: The paper demonstrates the approach on datasets like AVA and MOMA, achieving strong mAP performance and proving the method's data efficiency for VLM adaptation using sparse examples.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts large VLMs for multi-label, multi-person action detection tasks using minimal data, achieving robust performance and showcasing significant data efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), a multi-task learning framework for vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection, which incorporates spatial occupancy information to refine BEV representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for BEV 3D detection fail to effectively leverage environmental contexts, like roads and pavements, leading to incomplete physical world perception.

Method: The authors develop a pipeline with dense occupancy ground truths using local density information (LDO), apply voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) for fine-grained feature extraction, and introduce a collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module for integrating 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks.

Result: The proposed CoP model outperformed other vision-based methods on the nuScenes benchmark, achieving 49.5% mAP and 59.2% NDS on the test set.

Conclusion: CoP improves the quality of BEV representations by leveraging spatial occupancy as auxiliary information, demonstrating enhanced performance in 3D object detection tasks.

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning models for classifying African wildlife images, finding that Vision Transformer achieves superior accuracy but at higher computational costs, while DenseNet-201 balances performance and deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African wildlife populations have declined drastically, necessitating advanced tools like deep learning for effective monitoring and conservation.

Method: Deep learning models, including DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14, were compared for wildlife image classification, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors.

Result: DenseNet-201 achieved 67% accuracy among CNNs, while Vision Transformer ViT-H/14 achieved 99% accuracy but had higher computational costs.

Conclusion: DenseNet-201 is suitable for real-time applications due to its balance between accuracy and resource efficiency, contributing to AI-driven solutions for wildlife conservation.

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in

*I-Hsiang Chen,Hua-En Chang,Wei-Ting Chen,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Sy-Yen Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDAF introduces a framework for domain generalized semantic segmentation, utilizing latent domain priors and probabilistic diffusion modeling to improve performance on unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of domain shift in semantic segmentation when applied to unseen target environments, which significantly impairs model performance.

Method: PDAF deploys three key modules: (1) Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) to predict latent domain priors, (2) Domain Compensation Module (DCM) to adjust feature representation, and (3) Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) for estimating latent domain priors using probabilistic diffusion modeling.

Result: PDAF demonstrates improved generalization and robustness of semantic segmentation models across various challenging urban scenes.

Conclusion: The PDAF framework effectively models and compensates for domain shifts, validating its utility in enhancing semantic segmentation under diverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Top2Pano, an end-to-end model for synthesizing realistic indoor 360¬∞ panoramas from top-down 2D views focusing on geometry, photorealism, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between 2D top-down views and immersive 360¬∞ indoor panoramas for applications such as virtual reality and interior design, which is challenging due to lack of explicit 3D structure.

Method: Top2Pano uses volumetric occupancy estimation for 3D structures, volumetric rendering for generating coarse outputs, and a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet to enhance realism and structural integrity.

Result: Top2Pano outperformed baselines in generating photorealistic panoramas with accurate geometry, occlusions, and spatial arrangements, and generalized well even for schematic floorplans.

Conclusion: Top2Pano significantly advances the task of generating immersive indoor panoramas, demonstrating promise in bridging top-down and immersive visualization domains.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward utilizes pretrained multimodal language models for efficient evaluation of text-to-image generations, addressing limitations of typical approaches with an advanced cross-attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating text-to-image generation are slow, challenging to train, and typically rely on text-response analysis. The paper aims to introduce a streamlined, human-aligned evaluation process.

Method: The paper introduces LLaVA-Reward, which leverages hidden states from decoder-only multimodal models paired with a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. The approach supports fine-tuning using paired and unpaired data, enhancing visual-text representation interactions.

Result: LLaVA-Reward achieves superior performance in scoring generation quality, fidelity, alignment, safety, and overall ranking compared to traditional and existing multimodal methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LLaVA-Reward offers an efficient, scalable, and human-aligned solution for automatic evaluations of text-to-image generations, overcoming drawbacks in existing systems.

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and

### [149] [ReGATE: Learning Faster and Better with Fewer Tokens in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21420)
*Chaoyu Li,Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReGATE is an efficient token pruning method designed to accelerate multimodal large language model (MLLM) training by bypassing less informative tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational inefficiency in training multimodal large language models, which rapidly increases with the number of tokens.

Method: ReGATE employs a teacher-student framework where a frozen reference LLM guides adaptive token pruning based on difficulty scores and exponential moving averages.

Result: ReGATE matches peak accuracy 2√ó faster on MVBench using only 35% of tokens, while further training surpasses the baseline, achieving token reductions of over 41%.

Conclusion: ReGATE proves effective in reducing computational costs and improving training efficiency without compromising or even enhancing model accuracy.

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

### [150] [MapDiffusion: Generative Diffusion for Vectorized Online HD Map Construction and Uncertainty Estimation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21423)
*Thomas Monninger,Zihan Zhang,Zhipeng Mo,Md Zafar Anwar,Steffen Staab,Sihao Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapDiffusion leverages diffusion models to predict multiple plausible vectorized maps for autonomous driving, significantly improving accuracy and providing uncertainty estimates for complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map construction models for autonomous driving fail to capture uncertainty and real-world ambiguities like occlusions and missing features.

Method: MapDiffusion uses the diffusion model to iteratively refine map samples from a latent BEV grid, generating multiple plausible vectorized maps and deriving uncertainty estimates.

Result: The method outperforms baselines by 5% in the nuScenes dataset single-sample performance and consistently improves results with sample aggregation, with higher uncertainty in occluded areas.

Conclusion: MapDiffusion's generative approach enhances robustness in HD map construction and supports uncertainty-aware decision-making, making it better suited for complex autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

### [151] [Dual Cross-image Semantic Consistency with Self-aware Pseudo Labeling for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21440)
*Han Wu,Chong Wang,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the DuCiSC framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, improving cross-image semantic consistency by aligning prototypes and addressing feature discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing semi-supervised segmentation methods, such as overlooking region-level semantic consistency and handling imbalanced labeled-to-unlabeled data discrepancies.

Method: The proposed DuCiSC framework enforces pixel-wise and region-level semantic consistency across images using dual paradigms for aligning prototypes between labeled, unlabeled, and fused images. It also includes a self-aware confidence estimation to refine pseudo labels.

Result: DuCiSC achieves superior segmentation results across four datasets, including binary and multi-class benchmarks, as well as challenging anatomical structures, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The DuCiSC framework improves semi-supervised segmentation by addressing consistency and reliability challenges, showing robust performance and offering publicly available code for further research collaboration.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

### [152] [Recursive Visual Imagination and Adaptive Linguistic Grounding for Vision Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21450)
*Bolei Chen,Jiaxu Kang,Yifei Wang,Ping Zhong,Qi Wu,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a navigation policy for VLN using Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) and Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) techniques to improve scene understanding and command alignment, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the issues of overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which hinder navigation agents' ability to adhere to linguistic commands and utilize high-level scene priors.

Method: The method involves structuring historical trajectories as neural grids and employing RVI techniques for better scene understanding, along with ALG to align situational memories with linguistic commands. These methods are designed to improve the agent's visual perception and linguistic grounding.

Result: The proposed methods achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Recursive summarization of visual perceptions and precise linguistic alignment can significantly enhance navigational accuracy, showcasing the potential of RVI and ALG techniques for VLN tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

### [153] [Boost Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation via Parameterization, Predefined Augmentation, and Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21455)
*Sheng-Feng Yu,Jia-Jiun Yao,Wei-Chen Chiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, reducing dataset size to compact exemplars while maintaining significant performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of training costs due to the rapid growth of dataset sizes, aiming for efficient and compact datasets.

Method: Proposes techniques like parameterization via low-dimensional bases, tackling augmentation instability, and using lightweight networks to model augmented view connections.

Result: Enhanced distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively reduce dataset size while extracting rich information and retaining key characteristics, improving generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

### [154] [An Angular-Temporal Interaction Network for Light Field Object Tracking in Low-Light Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21460)
*Mianzhao Wang,Fan Shi,Xu Cheng,Feifei Zhang,Shengyong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel light field representation and network for object tracking in low-light scenes, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and discriminative spatial-angular modeling in low-light settings for reliable object tracking.

Method: Proposed Epipolar-Plane Structure Image representation and Angular-Temporal Interaction Network (ATINet) with self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in single and multiple object tracking using their new light field dataset.

Conclusion: High-quality angular-temporal modeling significantly improves visual expression and object tracking in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

### [155] [Describe, Adapt and Combine: Empowering CLIP Encoders for Open-set 3D Object Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21489)
*Zhichuan Wang,Yang Zhou,Zhe Liu,Rui Yu,Song Bai,Yulong Wang,Xinwei He,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Describe, Adapt and Combine" (DAC), a framework for open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR), leveraging CLIP and multi-modal language models to generalize representations using only multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of open-set 3DOR, where unseen object categories need to be retrieved despite insufficient 3D training data available.

Method: DAC integrates the CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for training and inference. It employs MLLM to describe seen categories for training adaptation and provide external hints about unseen objects during inference. An Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA) technique is introduced to avoid overfitting.

Result: DAC achieves significant improvements, outperforming previous methods by +10.01% mAP on four datasets for open-set 3DOR, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed DAC framework, using only multi-view images and incorporating generalized language-based and visual data representations, effectively advances performance in open-set 3D object retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at
https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC.

### [156] [VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507)
*Shibo Gao,Peipei Yang,Yangyang Liu,Yi Chen,Han Zhu,Xuyao Zhang,Linlin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the VAGU benchmark and GtS framework for Video Anomaly Detection, integrating anomaly grounding and understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) either focus on temporal localization or semantic understanding, but lack integration of both tasks, which are essential for comprehensive VAD.

Method: The authors propose VAGU, a benchmark combining anomaly category annotations, semantic explanations, temporal grounding, and Video QA. They introduce the GtS framework, guided by textual prompts and a training-free approach, for anomaly localization and refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the VAGU benchmark, GtS framework, and the new JeAUG metric, which evaluates semantic interpretation and temporal accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces a unified benchmark and framework for Video Anomaly Detection that combines grounding and understanding, complemented by novel evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient active learning (AL) method for large-scale vision-language models using uncertainty calibration and parameter-efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient sampling in AL for large-scale vision-language models with vast parameters.

Method: A novel parameter-efficient learning approach incorporating uncertainty calibration loss and a differentiable loss function for better sample selection during fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method matches or exceeds complex feature-based sampling methods in performance while being computationally efficient, as demonstrated through experiments across various datasets and vision backbones.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in reducing labeling costs, and a comparative analysis of prompt learning and LoRA is provided for their efficiency in sample selection.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

*Mengling Xu,Ming Tao,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Chain-of-Cooking," a model for visualizing cooking processes through step-by-step image generation. It tackles challenges like semantic inconsistency and image coherence and supports its approach via modules like Dynamic Patch Selection, Semantic Evolution, and Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought. Evaluation on a newly constructed dataset, CookViz, shows superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing models generate final food images from recipes but fail to visualize intermediate cooking steps. This limitation arises due to challenges like mismatched appearances between descriptions and generated images (semantic inconsistency) and maintaining contextual coherence across sequential steps.

Method: The "Chain-of-Cooking" model employs three main components: Dynamic Patch Selection for retrieving image patches as references, Semantic Evolution Module for establishing associations between latent prompts and cooking steps, and Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance to maintain coherence and sequential rationality. A new dataset, CookViz, is constructed to support and evaluate the methodology.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that "Chain-of-Cooking" surpasses existing methods in generating sequentially coherent and semantically consistent cooking process images.

Conclusion: "Chain-of-Cooking" successfully addresses semantic inconsistency and coherence issues, offering a robust solution for step-by-step cooking visualization. The model shows marked improvements over prior approaches and is validated using a novel dataset, CookViz.

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

*Ming-Hui Liu,Harry Cheng,Xin Luo,Xin-Shun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces the CS-DFD framework to improve deepfake detection by addressing gradient conflicts, achieving better in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust deepfake detection models that generalize to evolving manipulation techniques, as conventional methods suffer from degraded performance when trained on both original and synthesized forgeries.

Method: The proposed CS-DFD framework includes two modules: Update Vector Search (UVS) for reconciling gradient conflicts and Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) for enforcing aligned gradients through a novel loss function.

Result: CS-DFD demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization on various deepfake benchmarks.

Conclusion: By mitigating gradient conflicts, CS-DFD improves both parameter optimization and representation learning, making it a robust solution for deepfake detection in evolving domains.

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

TL;DR: The paper reviews sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms while addressing their complexities and uncertainties, providing a systematic analysis of existing techniques and identifying future directions for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and persistent uncertainties in sun sensor calibration necessitate advanced methodologies for improving accuracy and compensating for lifecycle variations.

Method: The paper systematically maps and reviews sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across various configurations and identifies research gaps.

Result: This review consolidates existing methodologies for sun sensors, offering a comprehensive analytical framework and insights into current research gaps.

Conclusion: The paper provides recommendations for future advances, aiming to minimize uncertainties and enhance the reliability of sun sensor calibration techniques.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

*Honglin He,Yukai Ma,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a Seeing-to-Experiencing (S2E) framework aimed at improving navigation foundation models by integrating reinforcement learning with pre-training on videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigation foundation models struggle with interactive and safe behaviors crucial for real-world urban navigation due to their reliance only on offline data.

Method: The proposed S2E framework combines offline pre-training on videos with online reinforcement learning in simulated environments. It introduces Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching for stable learning and a Residual-Attention Module for reactive behaviors while preserving pre-trained knowledge.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that S2E enhances interactivity, generalizability, and mitigates the limitations of scaling with offline data. A new evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, systematically tests these improvements.

Conclusion: Integrating online experiences with reinforcement learning is essential for scaling navigation foundation models and achieving better performance in robotics.

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-View Reconstruction (MVR) for high-precision 3D anomaly detection, converting point clouds into images and achieving high AU-ROC on a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D anomaly detection methods struggle with high-precision tasks due to limited global information application.

Method: MVR losslessly converts high-resolution point clouds into multi-view images and uses reconstruction-based anomaly detection to capture global information.

Result: MVR achieves 89.6% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7% point-wise AU-ROC on the Real3D-AD benchmark, confirming its efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed MVR method enhances global information learning for precise 3D anomaly detection, pushing performance metrics significantly higher compared to prior methods.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection is critical in industrial quality inspection. While
existing methods achieve notable progress, their performance degrades in
high-precision 3D anomaly detection due to insufficient global information. To
address this, we propose Multi-View Reconstruction (MVR), a method that
losslessly converts high-resolution point clouds into multi-view images and
employs a reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework to enhance global
information learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MVR, achieving 89.6\% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7\% point-wise AU-ROC on the
Real3D-AD benchmark.

### [163] [RelMap: Enhancing Online Map Construction with Class-Aware Spatial Relation and Semantic Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21567)
*Tianhui Cai,Yun Zhang,Zewei Zhou,Zhiyu Huang,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RelMap, a transformer-based framework for high-definition (HD) map construction in autonomous driving, addressing spatial and semantic relationship limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD map construction techniques lack proper incorporation of spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, hindering accuracy and generalization.

Method: The method introduces a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, leveraging a learnable relation encoder to encode positional dependencies, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Semantic Prior to refine instance decoding via class-specific expert routing.

Result: RelMap demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, and is compatible with single-frame and temporal perception backbones.

Conclusion: By integrating relational and semantic information, RelMap enhances the accuracy and generalization of online HD map construction for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

*Maxim Henry,Adrien Deli√®ge,Anthony Cioppa,Marc Van Droogenbroeck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LinDeps, a post-pruning method that improves the efficiency of neural network pruning without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size and complexity of CNNs make deployment on resource-constrained devices challenging, necessitating effective pruning techniques.

Method: LinDeps employs pivoted QR decomposition to identify linear dependencies among filters and incorporates a signal recovery mechanism to maintain performance after pruning.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet show LinDeps enhances compression rates and inference speed without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LinDeps improves pruning methods, maintains compatibility, boosts performance, and has wide applicability for existing and future techniques.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

### [165] [TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584)
*Kejia Zhang,Keda Tao,Zhiming Luo,Chang Liu,Jiasheng Tang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TARS, a novel preference optimization strategy to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models by addressing overfitting and improving grounding in visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the issue of hallucinations in multimodal large language models, which compromise their reliability by generating factually incorrect or visually ungrounded outputs. Existing strategies that align model outputs with human preferences are prone to overfitting and fail to preserve causal connections with visual input.

Method: The paper proposes TARS (Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy), a novel approach that reformulates preference optimization as a min-max optimization problem. TARS introduces controlled token-level semantic perturbations to simulate alignment uncertainty and minimize preference loss, reducing overfitting and preserving causal visual grounding.

Result: TARS achieves significant reductions in hallucination rates (from 26.4% to 13.2%) and cognition value (from 2.5 to 0.4) using only 4.8k preference samples without expert feedback. It outperforms standard direct preference optimization (DPO) and matches GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: TARS demonstrates that a token-adaptive approach can effectively improve the reliability of multimodal reasoning systems by reducing hallucinations, addressing overfitting concerns, and maintaining causal grounding. This method establishes itself as an effective strategy for vision-language reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

### [166] [Emerging Trends in Pseudo-Label Refinement for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Image-Level Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21587)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Wang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews recent advancements in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level annotations, highlighting key techniques, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the rapid development of WSSS methods with image-level annotations and the limitations of existing surveys in addressing recent trends and challenges, necessitating an updated and comprehensive review.

Method: The authors categorize existing WSSS methods based on types and levels of additional supervision, examine challenges in applying these methods to domain-specific datasets, and discuss limitations of current approaches while proposing future research directions.

Result: The review synthesizes state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image-level annotations and highlights both advanced methods and unexplored areas, particularly challenges in domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: This review serves as a resource for researchers familiar with WSSS fundamentals, offering insights into recent developments and guiding future research in this evolving field.

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

### [167] [Locally Controlled Face Aging with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21600)
*Lais Isabelle Alves dos Santos,Julien Despois,Thibaut Chauffier,Sileye O. Ba,Giovanni Palma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for face aging that incorporates regional variations in aging through latent diffusion models, resulting in more realistic and controllable aging effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face aging methods using GANs and diffusion models lack the ability to address heterogeneous aging patterns caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

Method: The method utilizes latent diffusion models to selectively apply aging effects to specific facial regions based on local aging signs, blending them seamlessly with a latent diffusion refiner for natural-looking results.

Result: The method achieves robust identity preservation, high-fidelity imagery, and realistic, controllable aging progressions in experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides finer control for face aging and offers significant improvement in realism and personalization over existing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

### [168] [Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Self-Supervised Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21606)
*Yaozong Zheng,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Ning Li,Shuxiang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Self-Supervised Tracking framework (SSTrack) that eliminates the need for manual box annotations in visual tracking by using a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework and instance contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the dependence on manually annotated datasets, which demand significant human effort and limit the scalability and diversity of visual tracking datasets.

Method: The proposed method introduces a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework for learning target information over time and an instance contrastive loss for robust instance-level correspondence without additional labels.

Result: SSTrack achieves substantial improvements compared to the state-of-the-art self-supervised tracking methods, with AUC increases of more than 25.3%, 20.4%, and 14.8% on the GOT10K, LaSOT, and TrackingNet datasets respectively.

Conclusion: By eliminating dependency on manual box annotations, SSTrack offers a more scalable solution for visual tracking datasets and achieves superior performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

*Maoquan Zhang,Bisser Raytchev,Xiujuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that a carefully configured DeepLabv3 model can outperform large-scale foundation models like SAM2 and MedSAM2 for specialized tasks in medical image segmentation, focusing on subtle, low-contrast boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation often faces challenges related to accuracy and robustness under varied imaging conditions, especially for specialized tasks like segmenting iPS cell colonies.

Method: DeepLabv3 was adapted and configured to address domain-specific segmentation tasks, leveraging strategies tailored for small datasets and subtle, low-contrast boundaries.

Result: The DeepLabv3 model achieved higher performance compared to larger models such as SAM2 and MedSAM2 for the given segmentation task, suggesting that simpler models can excel in domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: This study challenges the notion that more complex and generalized models are universally better, showing that appropriately adapted simpler models can be effective in specialized medical applications, with open-source implementation provided.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

*Arash Shahirpour,Jakob Gebler,Manuel Sanders,Tim Reuscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using synthetic data to train a neural network for autonomous drone inspection of wind turbines, achieving high performance on real-world images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing deep learning methods for drone inspection of wind turbines, which rely on manually labeled datasets with low diversity across environmental conditions and turbine types.

Method: Development of synthetic training data with controlled visual and environmental variations, combined with training a YOLOv11 feature detection network using a modified loss function.

Result: The trained network performed well on both synthetic and unseen real-world wind turbine images, achieving a Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real-world images.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can be effectively used to train high-performing neural networks for feature detection tasks, alleviating the reliance on diverse manually labeled datasets.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

*Wei Guan,Jun Lan,Jian Cao,Hao Tan,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EMIT, a framework that improves multimodal large language models for industrial anomaly detection (IAD) using a difficulty-aware optimization technique and enhanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in the effectiveness of MLLMs in IAD, which is critical for manufacturing system safety, as these models require domain-specific adaptations.

Method: EMIT combines several innovations: a multi-task IAD dataset, GPT-generated object text descriptions, soft prompts, heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings, and difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to tackle challenging cases.

Result: Experiments on the MMAD benchmark show that EMIT improves the IAD performance of InternVL3-8B by an average of 7.77% across seven tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed EMIT framework effectively enhances MLLMs for IAD, showcasing its potential to address domain-specific challenges and improve system reliability.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

*Qimin Wang,Xinda Liu,Guohua Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The proposed paper introduces GuidPaint, a training-free framework leveraging classifier guidance for precise and visually realistic image inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models lack fine-grained control during inpainting, often leading to inconsistent or implausible results without retraining.

Method: The authors developed a class-guided framework that adjusts intermediate denoising steps with classifier guidance and integrates stochastic and deterministic sampling.

Result: GuidPaint achieved superior semantic and visual outcomes compared to existing methods in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a novel approach for context-aware diffusion inpainting, ensuring better control and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies and labor demands of manual annotation for monitoring Antarctic benthic biodiversity, especially as understanding ecological changes becomes crucial due to climate pressures.

Method: A tailored object detection framework combining resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference, benchmarked across multiple architectures using a new dataset.

Result: Strong detection performance for medium and large organisms across 25 morphotypes, surpassing prior benchmarks, but limited effectiveness for small and rare taxa due to current architecture limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework sets a scalable foundation for future machine-assisted benthic biodiversity monitoring, but improvements are needed for detecting smaller and rarer taxa.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

### [175] [APT: Improving Diffusion Models for High Resolution Image Generation with Adaptive Path Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690)
*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Diffusion Models are currently limited in generating high-resolution images without extra training data or compute. APT, a new framework, overcomes this limitation using statistical matching and scale-aware scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the capability of latent diffusion models to generate high-resolution images without the need for additional large datasets or extensive computational resources.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework with Statistical Matching to address patch distribution shifts and Scale-aware Scheduling to handle patch monotonicity.

Result: APT generates clearer high-resolution images with improved details, maintaining inference speed and minimizing quality loss.

Conclusion: APT offers a practical, efficient method for generating high-resolution images without requiring expensive retraining or resource-intensive methods.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-step framework to handle privacy concerns in medical imaging by blocking identity-related areas and compensating with medical semantics while ensuring adjustable privacy levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in medical imaging's re-identification while preserving medical data's semantic integrity.

Method: A two-step framework: Identity-Blocking to block regions linked to identity and Medical-Semantics-Compensation using pre-trained models to restore semantic features, complemented by a feature decoupling strategy to remove residual identity information.

Result: Outperformed existing methods in evaluations conducted across seven datasets and three downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves desirable privacy preservation while maintaining semantic utility in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of quantitative measures for evaluating underwater image enhancement's real-world applicability, especially in tasks like path detection and navigation.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of context-aware benchmarks to evaluate underwater image enhancement methods and their practical implications.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

*Nils H√ºtten,Florian H√∂lken,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates component-specific roles in detection transformers using ablation methods and introduces the DeepDissect library for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the research gap in understanding the distinct roles of internal components within detection transformers to improve transparency and efficiency.

Method: Perform ablation studies on internal components of three detection transformers (DETR, DDETR, and DINO) and evaluate effects using gIoU and F1-score metrics on the COCO dataset.

Result: DETR is sensitive to encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA ablations. DDETR shows robustness due to multi-scale deformable attention. DINO is most resilient, benefiting from its look-forward twice update rule.

Conclusion: The study provides component-specific insights into detection transformers, highlighting structural redundancies and suggesting opportunities to simplify models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

### [179] [SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732)
*Qianxiong Xu,Lanyun Zhu,Chenxi Liu,Guosheng Lin,Cheng Long,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMITE for visual object tracking, solving issues like occlusion and error propagation that affect existing methods, and achieves high performance using a prototype memory bank and positional prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing VOT methods like neglecting temporal dependencies, generalization issues, and inability to handle occlusion and distraction.

Method: The authors developed SAMITE, which extends SAM2 by integrating a Prototypical Memory Bank and a Positional Prompt Generator to filter tracking errors and improve accuracy through targeted feature selection and positional clues.

Result: SAMITE outperforms state-of-the-art visual object tracking methods across six benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: SAMITE effectively resolves the key challenges in visual object tracking, creating a more reliable and precise tracking system for applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

*Shaojun E,Yuchen Yang,Jiaheng Wu,Yan Zhang,Tiejun Zhao,Ziyan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGE, a novel framework to address semantic and spatial losses in multimodal models, achieving superior alignment and performance benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges such as vector gaps and semantic disparities in multimodal models, which result in information loss during visual-text alignment.

Method: Propose a new framework, MAGE, utilizing Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN) and training strategies combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to achieve better alignment.

Result: MAGE demonstrated improved performance across various benchmarks like MME, MMBench, and SEED, expanding output capability boundaries.

Conclusion: MAGE successfully bridges visual and text semantic spaces, offers enhanced multimodal alignment, and sets a new standard in multimodal model benchmarks.

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

### [181] [Adversarial Reconstruction Feedback for Robust Fine-grained Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21742)
*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvRF, a framework to improve fine-grained image retrieval by learning representations free of category-specific semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FGIR methods rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen categories.

Method: AdvRF synergistically combines category-aware discrepancy localization with category-agnostic reconstruction to learn robust representations.

Result: AdvRF performs impressively on fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets, enhancing generalization and retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: AdvRF successfully mitigates semantic dependency issues and learns transferable representations for FGIR tasks.

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

*Aybora Koksal,A. Aydin Alatan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel few-shot reinforcement learning framework for satellite imagery analysis that doesn't require annotated captions, relying instead on rule-based rewards, and improves vision-language model performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision-language models struggle in specialized domains like remote sensing due to limited annotated data, necessitating new methods for cost-effective and data-efficient learning.

Method: The paper introduces the RLVR framework, which adapts reinforcement learning with verifiable reward from language models to vision-language models. It employs policy-gradient optimization to improve reasoning tasks using as few as one annotated example.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that even a single example significantly enhances model performance, with scaling to 128 examples achieving results comparable to models trained on thousands of annotations. The approach shows robust generalization across various remote sensing tasks.

Conclusion: RLVR facilitates efficient and cost-effective vision-language model development in data-scarce domains like remote sensing. The proposed method offers a practical guideline‚Äîstarting with a compact model, curating a few reward-checkable cases, and applying RLVR training.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFat is a lightweight model that efficiently detects driver fatigue using spatio-temporal graph learning with low computational demands and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of detecting driver fatigue in a resource-constrained and real-time setting, as current solutions are computationally intensive and unsuitable for embedded devices.

Method: LiteFat converts video data into spatio-temporal graphs using facial landmark detection, employs MobileNet for feature extraction, and utilizes a lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network to detect fatigue efficiently.

Result: LiteFat demonstrates competitive performance on benchmark datasets while significantly reducing computational complexity and latency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LiteFat is a practical, resource-efficient solution for real-time driver fatigue detection, suitable for embedded robotic systems like intelligent vehicles.

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoR-ViT, a vision transformer that dynamically adjusts token processing depth, achieving accuracy gains, reduced parameters, and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Vision Transformers (ViTs) have excessive parameter redundancy and computational costs, which hinders their deployment in practical applications.

Method: The proposed MoR-ViT uses a novel token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm, allowing adaptive computational depth per token.

Result: MoR-ViT achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, reduced parameters by 70%, and enabled 2.5x faster inference, outperforming efficient ViT baselines like DynamicViT and TinyViT.

Conclusion: Dynamic recursion is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of vision transformers, making them more scalable and deployable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pioneering framework called AU-LLM that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting micro-expression Action Units (AUs), a field previously unexplored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of detecting micro-expression AUs, which are critical for understanding subtle, involuntary human emotions. This is particularly difficult due to low-intensity expressions and limited data.

Method: The proposed framework, AU-LLM, integrates an "Enhanced Fusion Projector" (EFP) to bridge the vision-language semantic gap. It fuses mid- and high-level visual features using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), enabling a 3D-CNN backbone to create a dense token representation for nuanced reasoning by LLMs.

Result: The AU-LLM framework outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results on CASME II and SAMM datasets under rigorous evaluation protocols like Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain testing.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and robustness of LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression AU detection, paving the way for advancements in affective computing.

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

TL;DR: MSGCoOp enhances few-shot generalization for vision-language models by using multiple semantic-guided context vectors, semantic alignment from LLMs, and diversity regularization, showing improved performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the generalization ability of vision-language pre-trained models in few-shot tasks without adding computational complexity.

Method: Introduced MSGCoOp framework with parallel learnable context vectors, semantic guidance using LLM-generated class descriptions, and diversity regularization to ensure complementary feature learning.

Result: Achieved an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10% over baseline methods on 11 benchmark datasets, with enhanced performance in cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: MSGCoOp effectively improves few-shot and cross-domain generalization for VLMs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Motivation: Existing models struggle with variability and ambiguity in medical data, impacting their ability to capture nuanced clinical information and uncertainty.

Method: The method involves augmenting medical images with structured text reports from a large language model, modeling inter- and intra-modal uncertainty to enhance representational quality.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks in medical image-text pre-training.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured clinical text and uncertainty modeling improves generalization capabilities and represents a significant advance in medical image-text pre-training.

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the limitations of current video-based and 3D-based world generation techniques, including issues with consistency, training data, and memory efficiency.

Method: The framework uses a semantically layered 3D mesh representation combined with panoramic images as 360-degree world proxies, enabling semantic-aware decomposition and reconstruction of immersive 3D environments.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0 successfully bridges the gap between video diversity and 3D consistency, enabling robust generation of 3D scenes compatible with a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies how non-experts exploit vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image systems using prompt-based jailbreak tactics, and proposes a taxonomy for these strategies while advocating for better context-aware defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in alignment and content moderation, current LLMs and T2I systems remain susceptible to easily reproducible jailbreak attacks using simple clever prompts by everyday users.

Method: The researchers analyzed how non-expert users bypass safety mechanisms through methods such as multi-turn narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional impersonation, and semantic edits. They conducted empirical case studies and proposed a taxonomy of jailbreak techniques.

Result: The analysis demonstrated that all stages of existing moderation pipelines, including input filtering and output validation, are vulnerable to prompt-based bypass strategies accessible to ordinary users.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for context-aware defenses to address the simplicity and frequency of real-world jailbreak attacks on safety mechanisms in AI systems.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation focusing on suppressing redundant information without relying on architecture-specific designs. It employs a Redundancy Suppression Distillation (RSD) loss for better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limited applicability in existing cross-architecture knowledge distillation methods, which often involve complex designs and architecture-specific components.

Method: The approach involves using a Redundancy Suppression Distillation (RSD) loss, which includes cross-architecture invariance maximization and feature decorrelation objectives. Additionally, a lightweight module is incorporated to retain the student's architecture-specific capabilities.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the OFA approach on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with a significantly lower parameter overhead.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates potential as a simple and effective baseline for cross-architecture knowledge distillation, offering improved efficiency and generalizability over prior methods.

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

Method: SMFNet is proposed with a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) to optimally fuse motion (optical flow) and depth data, and a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to enhance feature integration with RGB data.

Result: The model was evaluated on RDVS, DVisal, and five video benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over 19 existing RGB-D VSOD models.

Conclusion: SMFNet effectively unleashes the potential of motion and depth data, offering state-of-the-art performance in RGB-D VSOD, with publicly available code and results.

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

*Jianhui Wang,Yinda Chen,Yangfan He,Xinyuan Song,Yi Xin,Dapeng Zhang,Zhongwei Wan,Bin Li,Rongchao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vid-TTA, a lightweight framework designed to improve video editing by enhancing temporal consistency and reducing overfitting, all while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing approaches struggle with temporal inconsistencies and overfitting due to limitations in handling complex motion and simple prompts. They also require significant computational resources and lack sufficient quality data.

Method: The authors propose Vid-TTA, which adapts during test time using self-supervised auxiliary tasks. It employs a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism, a prompt perturbation strategy, and dynamic loss balancing through meta-learning.

Result: Vid-TTA improves temporal consistency, reduces overfitting to prompts, and provides a performance boost for existing models without requiring high computational costs.

Conclusion: Vid-TTA addresses key challenges in video editing by leveraging lightweight optimization methods during inference, offering improved editing quality without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

*Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Dogucan Yaman,Hazƒ±m Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the problem of identifying objects that a person refers to using gesture and language, proposing a dual-model approach with Gaussian ray heatmap representation and ensemble techniques to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often fail to effectively use visual clues and oversimplify the pointing assumption, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: A dual-model framework predicts referents using both head-to-fingertip and wrist-to-fingertip lines, utilizing Gaussian ray heatmaps and a hybrid ensemble approach based on CLIP features.

Result: The proposed method improves performance, achieving approximately 4 mAP gains on the YouRefIt dataset at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances Embodied Reference Understanding by leveraging multimodal inputs and addressing limitations of single-line assumptions.

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

TL;DR: Aether Weaver is a framework that integrates multimodal narrative co-generation, linking text, visuals, and soundscapes for immersive storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of sequential text-to-visual pipelines in generating coherent and emotionally resonant narratives.

Method: The system integrates a Narrator (a large language model), Director (scene graph manager), Narrative Arc Controller, and Affective Tone Mapper to co-generate narratives and multimodal outputs concurrently.

Result: Aether Weaver showed improved narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance in various genres compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The framework provides an innovative platform for creative prototyping and immersive storytelling through integrated multimodal narrative generation.

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modern deepfake detectors struggle to identify deepfakes effectively, especially under real-world conditions, with many achieving low AUC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose a growing threat to identity verification and media authenticity, and existing detectors have not been comprehensively tested in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper evaluates deepfake detectors using a novel real-world testing procedure and a dataset of over 500,000 high-quality deepfake images created using state-of-the-art generation methods.

Result: The evaluation reveals that fewer than half of the tested detectors achieved an AUC score above 60%, and performance significantly decreases with basic image manipulations like JPEG compression.

Conclusion: Detecting deepfakes remains a significant challenge, and current models need substantial improvements to be effective in practical, real-world applications.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper examines the ability of AI models to predict race from dermatopathology images and analyzes the potential morphological shortcuts used by these models, raising concerns about unintended biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI has been successful in computational pathology but could carry demographic biases related to social determinants of health. This paper motivates the need to examine and address these biases.

Method: Researchers used digitized dermatopathology slides from a multisite, diverse dataset and applied an attention-based mechanism to identify race-associated morphological features. They evaluated three dataset curation strategies to mitigate confounding factors.

Result: The model demonstrated high race prediction performance for White and Black populations (AUC: 0.799, 0.762) but lower overall performance (AUC: 0.663). Attention analysis showed the epidermis as a critical predictive region; results worsened when this was removed.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of data curation and bias mitigation strategies to ensure fair and unbiased AI applications in pathology, emphasizing risks of unintended demographic bias.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtSeek is a multimodal framework combining large language models and retrieval-augmented generation to analyze digitized artworks via image input only, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling enhanced visual question answering and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitized artwork analysis demands understanding of visual, artistic, and historical contexts, challenging current methods due to limited linkage to structured data sources like Wikidata.

Method: ArtSeek incorporates a multimodal retrieval module, a contrastive multitask classification network, and an agentic reasoning strategy, supported by WikiFragments, a large image-text dataset enabling knowledge-based multimodal reasoning.

Result: ArtSeek outperforms competitors, with an +8.4% F1 gain in style classification and +7.1 BLEU@1 in captioning, demonstrating capabilities in motif interpretation and historical context inference for obscure works.

Conclusion: ArtSeek, focused on the visual arts, proves scalable and generalizable for other knowledge-intensive domains, and aims to enable further AI research with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwinECAT, a Transformer-based model combining Swin Attention with Efficient Channel Attention, to improve fundus disease image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accuracy and overfitting challenges in fundus image analysis due to small lesion areas and subtle inter-disease differences.

Method: SwinECAT combines Swin Attention for spatial structures/long-range dependencies and ECA Attention for critical feature channels.

Result: Achieved 88.29% accuracy, weighted F1-score of 0.88, and macro F1-score of 0.90 on the EDID dataset (16,140 images, 9 disease categories).

Conclusion: SwinECAT outperforms baselines and sets a new benchmark for 9-category fundus disease classification.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

*Tianhong Gao,Yannian Fu,Weiqun Wu,Haixiao Yue,Shanshan Liu,Gang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset to enhance reasoning and tool usage in multimodal large language models, demonstrating performance improvement across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models lack high-quality datasets to fully harness their capability for complex reasoning and tool utilization, prompting the need for a specialized dataset.

Method: MMAT-1M is built using a four-stage data engine: curating multimodal Q&A datasets, generating rationales via GPT-4, refining rationales through reflection, and optionally compressing dialogues into a simpler format.

Result: Models fine-tuned on MMAT-1M show significant performance gains, such as a 2.7% average improvement across benchmarks and an 8.8% gain on the Dyn-VQA benchmark.

Conclusion: MMAT-1M effectively enhances multimodal reasoning and tool capabilities in LLMs, filling a critical gap in the domain, and it is publicly available for broader use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMAC-Net, a new model for long-term action quality assessment in videos, which leverages multimodal attention consistency for better integration of visual and audio features, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in long-term action quality assessment fail to adequately leverage multimodal (visual and audio) interactions, or to model long-term temporal dynamics, leading to inaccurate evaluation of complex activities like rhythmic gymnastics.

Method: LMAC-Net introduces mechanisms for multimodal attention consistency and uses innovative modules, such as a multimodal local query encoder and two-level score evaluation, optimized jointly with attention-based and regression-based losses.

Result: Experiments on RG and Fis-V datasets show that LMAC-Net significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy for long-term action quality assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed LMAC-Net effectively captures cross-modal interactions and temporal dynamics, providing a more robust solution for action quality assessment in artistic sports.

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mixup-class prompting strategy for data-free quantization to address performance degradation caused by single-class prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance post-training quantization's effectiveness, particularly under privacy constraints with limited calibration data, while addressing shortcomings in synthetic image generation methods.

Method: A mixup-class prompting strategy is employed to fuse multiple class labels at the text prompt level, generating robust and diverse synthetic data for data-free quantization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance across CNNs and ViTs compared to state-of-the-art methods like GenQ, especially in extreme low-bit quantization scenarios (e.g., 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation).

Conclusion: The proposed mixup-class prompting method significantly improves generalization, optimization stability, and accuracy in data-free post-training quantization.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

*Jiyu Wu,Yifan Liu,Jiancheng Huang,Mingfu Yan,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel shadow removal method that doesn't rely on shadow masks, employing a specialized mechanism and network to address challenges like ambiguous intrinsic cues and soft shadow boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shadow masks are often difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Intrinsic image cues can guide shadow removal but are ambiguous in complex scenes, making it hard to distinguish between shadows and other visual elements.

Method: The authors propose the Adaptive Gated Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism to disentangle shadow features from other elements, and a diffusion-based Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) to restore delicate shadow details using high-frequency and contrast cues.

Result: The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance among mask-free shadow removal methods and competitive results compared to mask-based ones.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective mask-free shadow removal method that overcomes previous limitations by leveraging intrinsic cues and advanced attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

*Zheyuan Zhang,Yen-chia Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework targeting challenges in industrial smoke segmentation, employing a teacher-student architecture and advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level labels are scarce, especially in complex domains like industrial smoke segmentation requiring expert annotations.

Method: The paper introduces a teacher-student framework combining CNNs and ViTs, integrated with knowledge transfer loss for cross-architecture consistency and advanced post-processing techniques.

Result: The framework mitigates issues of incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate boundaries, and spurious correlations seen in previous methods.

Conclusion: This method effectively addresses segmentation challenges related to co-occurrence problems in industrial smoke without relying on external supervision.

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

*Jiahui Ren,Mochu Xiang,Jiajun Zhu,Yuchao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PanoSplatt3R, a method for wide-baseline panorama reconstruction without relying on precise pose information. This approach addresses limitations in existing methods dependent on pose by introducing novel techniques such as RoPE rolling and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to overcome reliance on precise pose information, which is computationally expensive and noisy in real-world applications, limiting panorama reconstruction's practicality.

Method: PanoSplatt3R extends foundational reconstruction techniques from the perspective domain to the panoramic domain. It introduces RoPE rolling‚Äîa modification to rotary positional embeddings‚Äîto model the horizontal periodicity of panorama images, ensuring efficient domain transfer.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generating high-quality novel views and accurate depth estimation, even without pose information.

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R offers a practical and effective solution for panorama reconstruction without precise pose information, showcasing its promising potential for realistic and immersive 3D environment reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for classifying ECG images into diagnostic categories, focusing on overcoming challenges like visual noise and fine waveform detail detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVDs cause high global mortality, and automating ECG image interpretation could enhance early detection and reduce dependency on human experts.

Method: The framework preprocesses ECG images to reduce noise and employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy using the ConvNeXt architecture, training on both synthetic/external datasets and target datasets.

Result: The model achieved high diagnostic performance, with AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the validation set and 0.9677 on the test set of a challenge.

Conclusion: This deep learning system shows promise for integrating automated ECG interpretation into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

*Zhijiang Li,Haoran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EIFNet is a multi-modal fusion network designed for event-based semantic segmentation, integrating event and frame-based data for enhanced scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of extracting reliable features from sparse/noisy event streams and fusing them effectively with dense image data for robust scene understanding in challenging environments.

Method: Proposes EIFNet, incorporating an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module for improved event representations and modules like MARM and MGFM for cross-modality feature alignment and integration.

Result: EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in event-based semantic segmentation tasks, as validated on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of EIFNet in improving event-based semantic segmentation, solving the challenges of feature extraction and modality fusion efficiently.

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaCLIP 2 introduces a method for training a CLIP model on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs, addressing challenges in multilinguality and improving performance across English and non-English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in training CLIP models on worldwide web data, especially addressing data curation issues in non-English languages and the "curse of multilinguality," where performance on English tasks degrades in multilingual models.

Method: MetaCLIP 2 involves a novel recipe for training CLIP from scratch using worldwide web-scale image-text pairs, employing minimal adjustments to ensure mutual benefits from English and non-English data.

Result: MetaCLIP 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks like zero-shot ImageNet classification (+0.8% improvement over English-only models), CVQA (57.4%), Babel-ImageNet (50.2%), and XM3600 (64.3%).

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses multilingual training challenges, proving that English and non-English data can mutually enhance performance in CLIP models, setting new standards in zero-shot classification and multilingual benchmarks.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

### [208] [Motion Matters: Motion-guided Modulation Network for Skeleton-based Micro-Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21977)
*Jihao Gu,Kun Li,Fei Wang,Yanyan Wei,Zhiliang Wu,Hehe Fan,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) for better skeletal-based micro-action recognition by focusing on subtle motion cues. MMN outperformed existing methods on key datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the recognition accuracy of Micro-Actions, which involve subtle motion changes but are often ignored in traditional approaches.

Method: The MMN employs two innovative modules: MSM to integrate motion cues at the skeletal level and MTM at the frame level. A motion consistency learning strategy is also used.

Result: MMN demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of subtle motion cues significantly improves micro-action recognition, and the MMN framework proves effective in achieving this goal.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

### [209] [ZIUM: Zero-Shot Intent-Aware Adversarial Attack on Unlearned Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21985)
*Hyun Jun Yook,Ga San Jhun,Jae Hyun Cho,Min Jeon,Donghyun Kim,Tae Hyung Kim,Youn Kyu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces ZIUM, a zero-shot adversarial attack method to exploit unlearned models, addressing computational inefficiency and customization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing privacy in machine learning by addressing the security risks posed by adversarial prompts exploiting unlearned models.

Method: Developing ZIUM, a Zero-shot Intent-aware attack approach, which customizes content based on user intent and performs efficient zero-shot adversarial attacks.

Result: ZIUM demonstrates high attack success rates while reducing computational costs in attacking unlearned concepts.

Conclusion: ZIUM offers significant advancements in privacy and security by enabling intent-aware and efficient adversarial attacks on unlearned models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

### [210] [Staining and locking computer vision models without retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22000)
*Oliver J. Sutton,Qinghua Zhou,George Leete,Alexander N. Gorban,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for watermarking (staining) and locking computer vision models to protect intellectual property without requiring model retraining, by modifying a small number of weights. These solutions include provable guarantees and minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting intellectual property in computer vision models is essential as models are increasingly shared and deployed. Existing watermarking methods require retraining or fine-tuning, which is inefficient.

Method: The staining and locking methods modify a small subset of weights in pre-trained models without the need for retraining. Locked models can be activated using a trigger patch, while guaranteeing low false positive rates via provable and computable measures.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these methods, showing the practical application across different computer vision models with minimal impact on accuracy in the unlocked state.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer innovative solutions for securing intellectual property in AI models, enabling efficient implementation without retraining, with strong theoretical and practical validation.

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

*Yida Tao,Yen-Chia Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEDANet combines citizen science and domain adaptation to segment industrial smoke, achieving comparable accuracy to fully supervised methods without target-domain annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge in industrial smoke segmentation caused by the high cost and limited availability of pixel-level annotations in real-world scenarios.

Method: CEDANet employs a human-in-the-loop system that refines pseudo-labels with citizen feedback and uses class-specific domain discriminators for feature alignment and representation transfer between source and target domains.

Result: CEDANet achieved an F1-score of 0.414 and smoke-class IoU of 0.261 with citizen feedback, significantly outperforming baseline scores of 0.083 and 0.043, respectively, demonstrating comparable performance to a fully supervised model trained on 100 annotated images.

Conclusion: CEDANet proves to be scalable and cost-efficient, demonstrating the utility of combining citizen science with weakly supervised domain adaptation for environmental monitoring tasks in data-scarce situations.

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

*Ziyun Dai,Xiaoqiang Li,Shaohua Zhang,Yuanchen Wu,Jide Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucination problems in large vision-language models (LVLMs) with a framework called ViHallu, which focuses on enhancing visual-semantic alignment for better fine-grained visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often generate inconsistent textual outputs (hallucinations) due to poor visual-semantic alignment, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained understanding.

Method: The paper introduces ViHallu, which uses controllable visual variation images and visual instruction datasets to improve fine-tuning and the correspondence between visual content and text.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ViHallu improves fine-grained visual understanding, reduces hallucinations, and enhances visual-semantic alignment on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViHallu is effective in addressing LVLM hallucination issues, and the released ViHallu-Instruction dataset aids further research in hallucination mitigation and alignment.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

*Sajay Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores dense audio-visual (AV) models in multilingual, low-resource, and noisy contexts using Indian languages, demonstrating the superiority of dense aggregation objectives for retrieval and localization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the performance of dense audio-visual models in multilingual and noisy low-resource environments characteristic of developing regions, and determine the impact of aggregation functions.

Method: Three contrastive objectives were tested: global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and a hybrid approach. Experiments were conducted with a multilingual subset of Project Vaani featuring Indian languages and dialects.

Result: The dense max-mean token matcher significantly outperformed global pooling with +59% relative improvement in R@1 (Audio Visual) and better retrieval ranks. It also provided sharp zero-shot localization heatmaps for spoken objects with frozen vision backbones.

Conclusion: Dense token routing proves crucial in resource-scarce multilingual scenarios, yielding superior retrieval and localization results without requiring vision backbone fine-tuning or annotations.

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

*Raju Ningappa Mulawade,Christoph Garth,Alexander Wiebel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel explainable AI method using a point-shifting mechanism to analyze decision-making in neural networks for point cloud classification, emphasizing human interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding AI decisions in critical applications is essential, especially with their growing usage in complex domains like point cloud data classification.

Method: The paper utilizes point cloud segmentation models to introduce perturbations via a point-shifting mechanism, creating saliency maps that facilitate meaningful, interpretable explanations.

Result: The method generates human-interpretable saliency maps outperforming traditional clustering algorithms in explainability and visualization.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enhances explainability in AI by producing meaningful saliency maps, helping users better understand point cloud classification models effectively.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

*Chaofei Qi,Chao Ye,Zhitai Liu,Weiyang Lin,Jianbin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper re-evaluates how network depth influences the encoding capabilities in fine-grained few-shot learning and proposes a novel location-aware constellation network (LCN-4) to enhance the performance of shallow backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether shallower deep learning architectures can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to mainstream deeper architectures in fine-grained few-shot learning.

Method: Introduces LCN-4, which leverages a location-aware feature clustering module, grid position encoding compensation, and frequency domain location embedding to enhance shallow network performance.

Result: LCN-4 outperforms ConvNet-4-based State-of-the-Art benchmarks and achieves comparable or better performance than many ResNet12-based methods.

Conclusion: Shallow networks, with the right enhancements, can be as effective as deeper networks in fine-grained few-shot learning, challenging the conventional preference for deeper backbones.

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Motivation: Address limitations in 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation by integrating semantics directly during the reconstruction process for better AI spatial understanding.

Method: Two components: CLIP3R for dense 3D point maps with embedded semantics, and 2D-3D OVS for lifting 2D features to enriched 3D semantic descriptors.

Result: Ov3R achieves state-of-the-art results in dense 3D reconstruction and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.

Conclusion: Ov3R represents a significant advance in semantics-aware Spatial AI, combining geometry and semantics effectively in real-time systems.

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for few-shot image recognition using MetaLab, which achieves near-human accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the technical challenges in few-shot image recognition compared to conventional large-scale recognition.

Method: Proposes MetaLab with two neural networks‚ÄîLabNet for domain transformation and LabGNN for mutual learning between lightness and color graphs.

Result: Experiments on 12 benchmarks show high accuracy, robustness, and generalization, achieving nearly 99% accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaLab approaches human recognition levels with minimal visual deviation, proving effective for few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes X-Omni, a framework incorporating reinforcement learning to enhance visual fidelity and instruction adherence in image generation through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in image generation from autoregressive models, such as low quality and failure in adhering to complex instructions, as well as move toward unifying image and language generation.

Method: Develop a framework with three key components: a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation.

Result: X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art image generation results, with high-quality visuals and improved ability to follow instructions and render long texts using a 7B language model.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can significantly enhance generation quality in discrete autoregressive modeling, paving the way for a unified approach to image and language generation.

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

Motivation: Existing active learning techniques are ineffective for surgical video analysis due to their focus on labeling individual frames or short clips, which ignores inter-step dependencies in long videos.

Method: StepAL employs a step-aware feature representation leveraging pseudo-labels and an entropy-weighted clustering strategy to select videos that combine uncertainty and diverse surgical step compositions for annotation.

Result: StepAL consistently outperformed traditional active learning methods on two cataract surgery datasets, achieving higher accuracy in step recognition with fewer labeled videos.

Conclusion: StepAL is an effective solution to optimize surgical video annotation processes, offering reliable performance in surgical step recognition while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MOVE, a dataset tailored for motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), and presents the Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA) as a baseline method to tackle challenges in motion-based object analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FSVOS datasets and methods prioritize static attributes like object categories, overlooking the temporal dynamics crucial for motion understanding in videos.

Method: The authors developed MOVE, a large-scale dataset for motion-guided FSVOS evaluations, and proposed Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA) as an innovative baseline methodology.

Result: MOVE enabled comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art methods, showcasing their limitations in motion understanding, while DMA achieved superior performance in few-shot motion-guided segmentation.

Conclusion: DMA‚Äôs success coupled with MOVE dataset insights lays a strong groundwork for advancing research in motion-based FSVOS challenges.

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

### [221] [Improving SpGEMM Performance Through Matrix Reordering and Cluster-wise Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21253)
*Abdullah Al Raqibul Islam,Helen Xu,Dong Dai,Aydƒ±n Bulu√ß*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces hierarchical clustering for sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) to improve data reuse and matrix locality, achieving significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SpGEMM is pivotal in scientific computing but suffers from inefficiencies due to irregular memory access patterns and data movement bottlenecks. Existing optimization methods focus mainly on SpMV, leaving SpGEMM comparatively underexplored.

Method: The authors propose hierarchical clustering with row reordering and cluster-wise computation, introducing a novel row-clustered matrix format and access pattern. This method decouples reordering algorithms from clustering schemes for flexible optimizations.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates that hierarchical clustering accelerates SpGEMM by an average of 1.39x, with preprocessing costs less than 20x of one SpGEMM for most inputs. Reordering based on graph partitioning shows superior performance albeit at higher preprocessing costs.

Conclusion: Hierarchical clustering effectively improves SpGEMM performance, offering better reuse and locality with reduced preprocessing costs compared to traditional reordering methods. It highlights the independent and combined impacts of reordering and clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a key kernel in many
scientific applications and graph workloads. Unfortunately, SpGEMM is
bottlenecked by data movement due to its irregular memory access patterns.
Significant work has been devoted to developing row reordering schemes towards
improving locality in sparse operations, but prior studies mostly focus on the
case of sparse-matrix vector multiplication (SpMV).
  In this paper, we address these issues with hierarchical clustering for
SpGEMM that leverages both row reordering and cluster-wise computation to
improve reuse in the second input (B) matrix with a novel row-clustered matrix
format and access pattern in the first input (A) matrix. We find that
hierarchical clustering can speed up SpGEMM by 1.39x on average with low
preprocessing cost (less than 20x the cost of a single SpGEMM on about 90% of
inputs). Furthermore, we decouple the reordering algorithm from the clustered
matrix format so they can be applied as independent optimizations.
  Additionally, this paper sheds light on the role of both row reordering and
clustering independently and together for SpGEMM with a comprehensive empirical
study of the effect of 10 different reordering algorithms and 3 clustering
schemes on SpGEMM performance on a suite of 110 matrices. We find that
reordering based on graph partitioning provides better SpGEMM performance than
existing alternatives at the cost of high preprocessing time. The evaluation
demonstrates that the proposed hierarchical clustering method achieves greater
average speedup compared to other reordering schemes with similar preprocessing
times.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GlideinWMS workspaces, system-like containers to simplify development, testing, and training for workload management systems used in experiments like CMS and DUNE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for streamlined development, testing, and onboarding processes for GlideinWMS, a key workload manager.

Method: Systems were developed as workspaces composed of three base containers with optional additional components, capable of running on laptops and integrated with IDEs for ease of use.

Result: These workspaces facilitated development and debugging, simplified onboarding and training, and proved effective in workshops for students.

Conclusion: GlideinWMS workspaces improve performance, development efficiency, and educational outreach, offering significant benefits to developers and learners.

Abstract: GlideinWMS is a workload manager provisioning resources for many experiments,
including CMS and DUNE. The software is distributed both as native packages and
specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other
communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like
containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source
tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to
see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what
differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base
system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute
element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a
scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional
containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a
laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with
an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our
experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are
easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing
development and testing of the system even when offline. They simplified the
training and onboarding of new team members and summer interns. And they were
useful in workshops where students could have first-hand experience with the
mechanisms and components that, in production, run millions of jobs.

*Marco Mambelli,Shrijan Swaminathan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces GlideinBenchmark, a tool to streamline benchmarking and automate resource allocation for better performance and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource selection critically impacts job speed, hardware utilization, and cloud costs; streamlining benchmarking is necessary.

Method: The authors developed GlideinBenchmark, leveraging GlideinWMS infrastructure to collect and analyze benchmarking data for automation.

Result: The solution controls benchmark execution and integrates with schedulers like HEPCloud to enhance resource allocation decisions.

Conclusion: GlideinBenchmark simplifies resource selection for workflows, demonstrating its potential to optimize cloud computing environments effectively.

Abstract: Choosing the right resource can speed up job completion, better utilize the
available hardware, and visibly reduce costs, especially when renting computers
in the cloud. This was demonstrated in earlier studies on HEPCloud. However,
the benchmarking of the resources proved to be a laborious and time-consuming
process. This paper presents GlideinBenchmark, a new Web application leveraging
the pilot infrastructure of GlideinWMS to benchmark resources, and it shows how
to use the data collected and published by GlideinBenchmark to automate the
optimal selection of resources. An experiment can select the benchmark or the
set of benchmarks that most closely evaluate the performance of its workflows.
GlideinBenchmark, with the help of the GlideinWMS Factory, controls the
benchmark execution. Finally, a scheduler like HEPCloud's Decision Engine can
use the results to optimize resource provisioning.

*Yicong Luo,Senhe Hao,Brian Wheatman,Prashant Pandey,Helen Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a concurrent B-skiplist optimizing cache locality and performance over traditional skiplists. It boosts throughput dramatically compared to existing skiplist and tree-based indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional skiplists suffer from poor cache locality, limiting in-memory index performance in key-value stores.

Method: The authors propose a concurrent B-skiplist using a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm and an optimized concurrency control scheme.

Result: The B-skiplist achieves 2x-9x higher throughput compared to leading skiplist implementations and competes well against tree-based indices, with up to 103x lower latency.

Conclusion: The concurrent B-skiplist improves cache performance, throughput, and latency, providing a practical alternative to traditional skiplists and other indices while keeping simplicity intact.

Abstract: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores,
such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple
concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor
cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving
performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to
maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.
In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache
locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional
skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions
include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a
corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128
threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher
throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations,
including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java
ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves
competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to
state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a
more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of
skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between
3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between
0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads
with inserts.

*Marlon Etheredge,Thomas Fahringer,Felix Erlacher,Elias Kohler,Stefan Pedratscher,Juan Aznar-Poveda,Nishant Saurabh,Adrien Lebre*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Collaborative State Machines (CSM) programming model for developing reactive, stateful Cloud-Edge-IoT applications, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in existing programming models which struggle with the dynamic and stateful nature of Cloud-Edge-IoT applications.

Method: The authors propose the CSM programming model, featuring state machine collaboration using events, encapsulated states, integrated service actions, and an advanced data model. They present a runtime system and evaluate it using various use cases on the Grid'5000 testbed.

Result: The evaluation shows substantial performance improvements: a 12x increase in throughput, a 2.3x improvement in processing time compared to Serverless Workflow in a surveillance system, and a 55x reduction in processing time for a smart factory, along with enhanced productivity.

Conclusion: CSM effectively addresses complexities in Cloud-Edge-IoT application development, providing a robust and efficient programming model with demonstrated improvements in performance and productivity.

Abstract: The development of Cloud-Edge-IoT applications requires robust programming
models. Existing models often struggle to manage the dynamic and stateful
nature of these applications effectively. This paper introduces the
Collaborative State Machines (CSM) programming model to address these
complexities. CSM facilitates the development of reactive, event-driven, and
stateful applications targeting the Cloud-Edge-IoT continuum. Applications
built with CSM are composed of state machines that collaborate autonomously and
can be distributed across different layers of the continuum. Key features of
CSM include (i) a sophisticated collaboration mechanism among state machines
utilizing events and persistent data; (ii) encapsulation of state through the
inherent state of state machines and persistent data; (iii) integration of
actions and service invocations within states and state transitions, thereby
decoupling complex application logic from compute and data processing services;
and (iv) an advanced data model that supports the processing of local, static,
and persistent data with defined scope and lifetime. In addition to introducing
the CSM programming model, we present a runtime system and a comprehensive
evaluation of our approach. This evaluation is based on three use cases: a
stress test on a large-scale infrastructure, a surveillance system application,
and a complex smart factory scenario, all deployed on the Grid'5000 testbed.
Our results demonstrate a 12x increase in throughput through novel language
features in the stress test. Compared to Serverless Workflow, a
state-of-the-art baseline system, we show a 2.3x improvement in processing time
per processed image in a surveillance system use case, a 55x reduction in total
processing time for a smart factory use case, and an overall improvement in
productivity across these use cases.

### [226] [The Performance of Low-Synchronization Variants of Reorthogonalized Block Classical Gram--Schmidt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21791)
*Erin Carson,Yuxin Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study evaluates low-synchronization block classical Gram-Schmidt variants called BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S for distributed memory systems, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address communication and synchronization bottlenecks in large-scale distributed memory systems using the widely-used block classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm and its variants.

Method: The paper evaluates the performance of low-synchronization BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S variants by comparing them to traditional algorithms and other low-synchronization implementations on distributed systems.

Result: Numerical experiments show performance speedups of up to 4x for BCGSI+P-1S and 2x for BCGSI+P-2S compared to the classical BCGSI+, with improved stability over other similar synchronization-cost variants.

Conclusion: BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S are recommended as practical choices for economic QR factorization in distributed memory systems due to their combination of speed and stability.

Abstract: Numerous applications, such as Krylov subspace solvers, make extensive use of
the block classical Gram-Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized
variants for orthogonalizing a set of vectors. For large-scale problems in
distributed memory settings, the communication cost, particularly the global
synchronization cost, is a major performance bottleneck. In recent years, many
low-synchronization BCGS variants have been proposed in an effort to reduce the
number of synchronization points. The work [E. Carson, Y. Ma, arXiv preprint
2411.07077] recently proposed stable one-synchronization and
two-synchronization variants of BCGS, i.e., BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S. In this
work, we evaluate the performance of BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S on a distributed
memory system compared to other well-known low-synchronization BCGS variants.
In comparison to the classical reorthogonalized BCGS algorithm (BCGSI+),
numerical experiments demonstrate that BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S can achieve up
to 4 times and 2 times speedups, respectively, and perform similarly to other
(less stable) one-synchronization and two-synchronization variants. BCGSI+P-1S
and BCGSI+P-2S are therefore recommended as the best choice in practice for
computing an economic QR factorization on distributed memory systems due to
their superior stability when compared to other variants with the same
synchronization cost.

*Prital Bamnodkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents TFC-SR, a memory-stabilizing continual learning approach, outperforming baseline methods on tasks like Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks face catastrophic forgetting, a degradation in performance on earlier tasks when learning new ones. The motivation is to address this challenge effectively.

Method: The paper introduces TFC-SR, which uses Active Recall Probe within experience replay to periodically and task-specifically evaluate and stabilize model memory.

Result: On benchmarks like Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100, TFC-SR achieves superior performance (e.g., 13.17% accuracy on Split CIFAR-100 vs. 7.40% for standard replay).

Conclusion: TFC-SR is a robust, memory-efficient continual learning method that integrates active retrieval mechanisms, offering significant performance improvements in constrained settings.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Abstract: We compare pre-, in-, and post-processing techniques for class imbalance
mitigation in optical network failure detection. Threshold Adjustment achieves

Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional methods, especially the curse of dimensionality, by leveraging quantum geometric concepts to explore datasets in a more holistic manner.

Method: QCML represents data features using learned Hermitian matrices and maps individual data points to Hilbert space states. The method derives geometric and topological properties - such as intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and Berry curvature - directly from the dataset.

Result: QCML successfully captures and describes the global properties of data across synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The quantum geometric approach of QCML offers new insights into data representation and has potential applications in understanding cognitive phenomena under the framework of quantum cognition.

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as

Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global

TL;DR: The paper proposes new independence criteria and applies them to dimensionality reduction methods, outperforming several baseline algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional kernel approaches to machine learning require expert-tuned nonlinearity to capture data's inherent diversity effectively. This paper seeks to enhance this process.

Method: The authors reviewed independence criteria, proposed three new ones, and incorporated them into dimensionality reduction methods for unsupervised and supervised learning.

Result: The dimensionality reduction methods, using the proposed criteria, showed superior performance compared to tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, and supervised/unsupervised VAE.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improved contrast, accuracy, and interpretability, potentially advancing interpretable ML development.

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new contrastive learning approach to address wildfire prediction challenges caused by imbalanced data and high computational costs, introducing a curriculum-based strategy for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve wildfire risk assessment in light of increasing challenges posed by climate change, data imbalance, and computational inefficiency in traditional methods.

Method: The authors developed a morphology-based curriculum contrastive learning framework to tackle issues with high-dimensional spatio-temporal data and frequent updates, leveraging enhanced latent representations and smaller patch sizes.

Result: The proposed modeling strategies were experimentally validated, showing the effectiveness of the new curriculum contrastive learning approach in improving predictions without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: This work provides an innovative method to better predict wildfires using advanced deep learning techniques, addressing both data and computational challenges.

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting models struggle with low-magnitude and sparse time series due to biases in loss functions, training-time sampling, and encoding methods.

Method: The paper proposes SPADE-S, a specialized architecture aimed at reducing biases linked to magnitude and sparsity, while improving forecasting accuracy using new methodologies.

Result: SPADE-S outperforms state-of-the-art models across various demand forecasting tasks, achieving up to 15% accuracy gains and measurable improvements in P90 and P50 forecast accuracies across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SPADE-S effectively addresses systematic biases in low-magnitude and sparse time series forecasting, delivering robust and accurate performance across large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,
respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to
700 million series, from a large online retailer.

### [235] [Advancing Compositional LLM Reasoning with Structured Task Relations in Interactive Multimodal Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21199)
*Xinye Cao,Hongcan Guo,Guoshun Nan,Jiaoyang Cui,Haoting Qian,Yihan Lin,Yilin Peng,Diyang Zhang,Yanzhao Hou,Huici Wu,Xiaofeng Tao,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single compositional LLM paradigm for Interactive Multimodal Applications (IMAs), addressing challenges in resource-constrained environments using ContextLoRA for task adaptation and ContextGear for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, which lack efficiency and flexibility in mobile settings. The need exists for a single, adaptable, and efficient model.

Method: The authors propose ContextLoRA to construct task dependency graphs and facilitate reasoning across tasks, combined with ContextGear, a resource-efficient training strategy through strategic grouping.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on three benchmarks and demonstrates practical applicability in real wireless environments.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm advances the capability of LLMs in IMAs, combining task flexibility and resource efficiency. Code will be shared with the community.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

*Lakpa Tamang,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Richard Dazeley,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses mechanisms for tackling distribution shifts during machine learning deployment, focusing on covariate and semantic shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges posed by distribution shifts between training and testing phases in machine learning applications.

Method: Formalize distribution shift types, review existing techniques for detection and mitigation, and propose research directions.

Result: The paper aggregates existing methods and identifies gaps in handling distribution shifts, specifically out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

Conclusion: Existing methods inadequately address distribution shifts, urging improved unified approaches and highlighting overlooked research opportunities in OOD data handling.

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

### [237] [OCSVM-Guided Representation Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21164)
*Nicolas Pinon,Carole Lartizien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) by tightly coupling representation learning with one-class SVM (OCSVM), evaluated on MNIST-C and brain MRI lesion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting anomalies without labeled data is essential in scenarios where anomalous examples are rare, and existing methods face challenges such as over-reconstruction of anomalies or suboptimal feature spaces.

Method: The proposed method aligns latent features with the decision boundary of an analytically solvable OCSVM through a custom loss, ensuring tight coupling of representation learning and anomaly detection.

Result: Experiments on MNIST-C and brain MRI subtle lesion detection tasks show the method's robustness against domain shifts and effectiveness in clinically relevant cases.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for general unsupervised anomaly detection and real-world medical imaging, highlighting its improved robustness and performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static training datasets and explore structured interaction as a new method to improve reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors developed a self-evolving framework called AGORA, enabling collaborative ensembles of models to leverage collective abilities for enhanced performance.

Result: AGORA demonstrated up to 4.45 percentage points improvement on mathematical benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art monolithic systems.

Conclusion: Interaction within collaborative ecosystems is a scalable method for enhancing AI reasoning capabilities, highlighting the importance of engineering such ecosystems for intelligence emergence.

Abstract: Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the
current training datasets. We propose structured interaction as a new scaling
axis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of increasing model parameters. Our
self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve
reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to
4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems
from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of
intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems
as a vital frontier for capability emergence.

TL;DR: This study develops an interpretable framework (LAI-ML) integrating XGBoost and Large Language Models (LLM) for sarcopenia risk assessment, providing both high predictive accuracy and clear explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'black box' issue in high-performance machine learning models like XGBoost, which hinders clinical adoption due to lack of interpretability.

Method: Introduced LAI-ML, a knowledge distillation framework that converts XGBoost feature attributions into probabilistic formats and uses an LLM, reinforced with techniques like case-based retrieval, to generate interpretable diagnostic narratives.

Result: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy, 13% higher than XGBoost. The LLM improved reasoning, correcting predictions in 21.7% of mismatched cases.

Conclusion: LAI-ML bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and interpretability, presenting a deployable, transparent AI solution for clinical use cases.

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization" (MaPPO), a method that enhances alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences by integrating prior reward information into the optimization process, resulting in improved performance and flexibility in preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Preference Optimization (PO) for aligning LLMs with human preferences by addressing limitations of existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which oversimplify the problem as binary classification.

Method: MaPPO extends DPO by incorporating prior reward knowledge through a Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. It generalizes DPO without introducing extra hyperparameters and supports both offline and online preference optimization.

Result: MaPPO consistently outperformed existing methods, including DPO variants (e.g., SimPO, IPO, and CPO), in multiple benchmarks such as MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MaPPO provides a principled and practical improvement over current PO methods, demonstrating better alignment performance for LLMs by leveraging prior reward knowledge without additional computational costs or complexity.

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoSLD, a framework using evolutionary algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the discovery of deep learning scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering scaling laws in neural networks traditionally requires significant manual effort, hindering the efficient exploration of model, dataset, and resource adjustments.

Method: The proposed EvoSLD framework automates Scaling Law Discovery by employing evolutionary algorithms guided by LLMs to co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines.

Result: EvoSLD rediscovered exact human-derived scaling laws in two scenarios, outperformed them in others, and achieved significantly lower error rates in held-out evaluations compared to baselines.

Conclusion: EvoSLD offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and efficient method to identify scaling laws, demonstrating its potential to advance AI research by reducing manual work and improving performance.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

TL;DR: AdaptHetero transforms machine learning interpretation into actionable subgroup-specific training and evaluation for EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of guiding subgroup-specific modeling in complex and heterogeneous EHR data.

Method: Proposed AdaptHetero, a framework combining SHAP-based interpretation with unsupervised clustering for tailoring model training and evaluation.

Result: AdaptHetero improves identification of subgroup-specific characteristics and enhances predictive performance on three large-scale EHR datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages interpretability to improve modeling for tailored healthcare predictions in diverse hospital subpopulations.

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

*Raj Krishnan Vijayaraj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called LAPD to evaluate the robustness of clinical decision-support LLMs against subtle input changes, highlighting the importance of latent representation stability in safety-critical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NLP metrics fail to detect reasoning failures in clinical LLMs caused by small but clinically significant input changes. This represents a critical gap in ensuring the reliability of these models for safety-critical tasks.

Method: The authors propose LAPD, a geometry-aware framework that uses structured adversarial edits (e.g., masking, negation, synonym replacement) to probe latent robustness. A diagnostic measure, LDFR, captures how frequently representations cross decision boundaries in a PCA-reduced latent space. The framework is tested on clinical notes generated via structured prompting and perturbed across four axes.

Result: The study shows that clinical and foundation LLMs exhibit latent fragility even under minimal changes. This finding is validated using real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark, demonstrating the framework's utility beyond synthetic scenarios.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there is a significant gap between robustness at the surface level and semantic stability. Geometry-aware evaluations like LAPD are vital for ensuring the reliability of clinical LLMs in decision support applications.

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how agents with limited memory and computation resources can optimally allocate these resources for better performance.

Method: The researchers use a theoretical framework to analyze the capacity-constrained LQG sequential prediction problem and derive solutions. They also address optimal capacity allocation for decomposable problems in the steady state.

Result: The paper provides solutions for optimal resource allocation in the defined problem and demonstrates steady-state optimality across decomposable sub-problems.

Conclusion: This research lays foundational theoretical groundwork for studying learning under conditions of capacity constraints.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a principled, interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to neural network architectures for learning on graphs.

Method: The framework uses GLWT for graph spectral decomposition and employs multiscale filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic to perform learning tasks.

Result: The proposed system exhibits competitive performance on synthetic graph denoising and token classification tasks compared to lightweight graph neural networks, with advantages in transparency and efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach provides a transparent, efficient, and interpretable alternative to deep neural networks for graph learning tasks.

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures

TL;DR: This paper highlights enhancements to Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for better performance on heterophilic graphs by proposing a structure learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in GCNs' performance on heterophilic graphs, specifically issues with capturing long-range dependencies and oversmoothing.

Method: The method involves parameterizing the adjacency matrix for edge rewiring, enabling shallow GCNs to capture long-range node relationships by extending the hop span.

Result: The proposed approach improves GCN performance on certain heterophilic graphs by capturing long-range dependencies effectively, but lacks generalizability and offers inconsistent results on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: Although the rewiring method enhances shallow GCNs for specific heterophilic graphs, its limitations in generalizability and inconsistent performance warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework
that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario
training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks.
EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new gradient inversion attack method called Grab to uncover privacy risks in federated learning for language models, achieving exceptional recovery rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underestimated privacy threats posed by gradient inversion attacks in federated learning for language models, notably due to their discrete token nature.

Method: Grab employs two alternating optimization processes: one for dropout masks improving token recovery and another discrete optimization for effective token sequencing.

Result: Grab achieves up to a 92.9% recovery rate of private training data, surpassing prior strategies by up to 28.9% in benchmark and 48.5% in practical settings.

Conclusion: The work significantly advances understanding of privacy risks in federated learning for language models, highlighting the vulnerability to gradient inversion attacks.

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy

### [250] [Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21205)
*Harsh Rangwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in learning from imperfect, long-tailed data distributions in real-world scenarios by developing algorithms for deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the labor-intensive curation process of datasets and enable deep models to operate effectively on real-world, diverse data distributions.

Method: The paper proposes a four-part approach: addressing generative modeling for minority classes, generalization for long-tailed data, optimizing metrics for semi-supervised learning, and efficient domain adaptation.

Result: Proposed algorithms successfully mitigate issues like mode-collapse, enhance tail class generalization, improve learning metrics, and enable domain adaptation with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The algorithms presented facilitate robust learning from diverse and imperfect real-world data, broadening deep learning applications.

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

### [251] [Bubbleformer: Forecasting Boiling with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21244)
*Sheikh Md Shakeel Hassan,Xianwei Zou,Akash Dhruv,Vishwanath Ganesan,Aparna Chandramowlishwaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model for forecasting boiling dynamics autonomously and with high physical fidelity, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in modeling boiling dynamics, particularly the inability of current neural PDE surrogates to forecast without future inputs and model complex flow boiling velocity fields.

Method: The paper proposes Bubbleformer, which uses factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and thermophysical parameter conditioning to forecast boiling dynamics accurately without reliance on simulation data during inference.

Result: Bubbleformer demonstrates benchmark-setting performance in prediction and forecasting boiling dynamics, supported by high-fidelity evaluations on BubbleML 2.0, a diverse boiling dataset that the paper also introduces.

Conclusion: Bubbleformer advances the autonomous and interpretable modeling of chaotic boiling systems, improving our ability to model multiphase energy and thermal systems in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

*Amartya Banerjee,Xingyu Xu,Caroline Moosm√ºller,Harlin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework using diffusion models to leverage noisy data inputs for effective protein structure reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for recovering parameters from noisy experimental data often require precise knowledge of noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data type, making them inefficient and challenging.

Method: The researchers propose Adam-PnP, which combines adaptive noise estimation and dynamic modality weighting mechanisms to integrate multiple sources of noisy data into a pre-trained protein diffusion model.

Result: Adam-PnP significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy in complex protein structure recovery tasks, demonstrating its capability in handling heterogeneous noisy data.

Conclusion: Adam-PnP simplifies hyperparameter tuning while effectively guiding generative models for protein reconstruction, offering a promising solution for integrating diverse experimental data.

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

### [253] [Deep Polynomial Chaos Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21273)
*Johannes Exenberger,Sascha Ranftl,Robert Peharz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepPCE, a deep version of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), aimed at high-dimensional problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCE struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems because the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the number of parameters.

Method: The authors propose DeepPCE, which integrates PCE with probabilistic circuit methods to handle high-dimensional inputs effectively.

Result: DeepPCE is capable of matching the predictive performance of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) while retaining the exact inferential capabilities of PCE.

Conclusion: DeepPCE offers a scalable solution to high-dimensional modeling challenges, combining the strength of PCE for statistical inference and MLP-level predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

### [254] [Large Language Model-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Diverse and Novel Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21274)
*Jiin Woo,Alireza Bagheri Garakani,Tianchen Zhou,Zhishen Huang,Yan Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAAC leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in a novel bilevel optimization framework to enhance diversity, novelty, and accuracy in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation systems often lack diversity and novelty, as they prioritize click relevance. Current approaches like reinforcement learning depend on random exploration, which might not align with user preferences.

Method: LAAC uses LLMs as reference policies to suggest novel items and trains a lightweight policy to refine these suggestions using system-specific data. Training is designed as bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LAAC improves diversity, novelty, and accuracy, showing robustness in handling imbalanced data without requiring expensive fine-tuning of LLMs.

Conclusion: LAAC provides an effective method for integrating LLM knowledge to recommend diverse and novel items in recommendation systems, addressing limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

### [255] [Blending data and physics for reduced-order modeling of systems with spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21299)
*Alex Guo,Michael D. Graham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid reduced-order model (ROM) utilizing physics-based and data-driven methods for predicting chaotic systems' spatiotemporal dynamics, resulting in better accuracy compared to data-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While data-driven reduced-order models are effective for chaotic systems, their predictive accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating known physics from full-order models (FOM).

Method: The approach combines physics-derived vector fields projected onto an invariant manifold using autoencoders and dynamic data correction or Bayesian prior updates via neural ordinary differential equations.

Result: The hybrid method significantly improves time-series predictions in scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even when the underlying physical model has errors.

Conclusion: Integrating physics and data in reduced-order modeling offers superior prediction capability, highlighting the strength of hybrid approaches for chaotic dynamics modeling.

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

*Sodtavilan Odonchimed,Tatsuya Matsushima,Simon Holk,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAGDP accelerates diffusion policy generation using a retrieval-based framework to improve trade-offs between accuracy and generation speed without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the problem of long action generation times in Diffusion Policies caused by multiple noise removal steps during inference.

Method: RAGDP leverages a retrieval-augmented framework by constructing a vector database from observation-action pairs of expert demonstrations, enabling quick expert action extraction during inference to reduce noise removal steps.

Result: RAGDP achieves better accuracy and speed trade-off compared to diffusion distillation methods, maintaining a 7% accuracy improvement while accelerating models up to 20 times.

Conclusion: RAGDP successfully eliminates the need for extra training time, expedites inference, and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of Diffusion Policies.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

*Wenkai Tan,Alvaro Velasquez,Houbing Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic framework combining neural networks (NeRF) and physics-informed methods (PINN) for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects using sparse image data instead of full geometric information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance empirical neural methods' adaptiveness with physical principles and overcome the limitations of geometry-dependent numerical solvers for elastic object simulation.

Method: The method integrates a neural radiance field (NeRF) for reconstructing objects visually with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) governed by elasticity equations, using energy constraints to manage boundary and initial complexities.

Result: Achieved a spatiotemporal representation of deforming objects with improved simulation accuracy and explainability by fusing image data and symbolic physics constraints.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates an effective way to study elastic object deformation without complete geometric data, offering a fusion of visual data and scientific principles for enhanced modeling.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

*Yaoyu Zhang,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network, aimed at improving time series classification under challenging data conditions through enhanced sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with time series classification when faced with issues like class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise.

Method: CDNet uses a learned diffusion process to generate positive and negative samples, employing convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps and incorporating uncertainty-weighted loss for robust training.

Result: CDNet enhances SOTA deep learning classifiers, especially under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions, based on experiments on UCR Archive and simulated datasets.

Conclusion: CDNet provides a theoretically sound and empirically validated approach to improving time series classification by addressing key limitations in existing models.

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

### [259] [Efficient Neural Combinatorial Optimization Solver for the Min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21386)
*Xuan Wu,Di Wang,Chunguo Wu,Kaifang Qi,Chunyan Miao,Yubin Xiao,Jian Zhang,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ECHO, a new solver targeting the min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), and demonstrates its superior performance over existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Neural Combinatorial Optimization solvers primarily address single-vehicle problems, neglecting the more complex and realistic multi-vehicle MMHCVRP. Current solutions also suffer from myopic decisions and disregard key problem features, leading to less effective outcomes.

Method: The authors propose ECHO, which employs a dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships, a Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to reduce myopic decision-making, and a data augmentation strategy addressing vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry for stable Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Experiments show that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art solvers across various vehicle counts, node scales, and distribution patterns. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual techniques proposed in ECHO.

Conclusion: ECHO effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches to MMHCVRP and provides a robust and generalizable solution to this challenging problem.

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EpochCore introduces a hardware accelerator designed for efficient State-Space Models (SSMs) in handling long-range sequences, achieving massive performance and energy efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limitations of existing sequence modeling approaches like RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers, which struggle with very long sequences due to memory retention issues; and to improve the computational efficiency of SSMs despite their reliance on differential equations.

Method: The paper introduces EpochCore, a hardware accelerator using systolic arrays with a specialized processing element (LIMA-PE) to efficiently execute both traditional neural network and SSM MAC operations. It also proposes ProDF, a unique dataflow for optimized SSM processing.

Result: EpochCore achieves significant performance improvements: 250x in throughput, 45x in energy efficiency, and ~2,000x lower latency on LRA datasets compared to GPU-based approaches, with only a modest increase in area cost.

Conclusion: EpochCore demonstrates the feasibility of specialized hardware to drastically enhance computational and energy efficiency for SSMs, making SSM-based sequence modeling more practical for long-range tasks.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MOCHA algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), capable of systematically exploring Pareto-stationary solutions with finite-time sample complexity guarantees and achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of exploring Pareto-stationary solutions under non-convex reward objectives in MORL with finite-time sample complexity guarantees.

Method: Proposed the MOCHA algorithm, combining weighted-Chebychev scalarization and actor-critic methods to enable systematic exploration of Pareto-stationary solutions.

Result: The MOCHA algorithm achieves a sample complexity of approximately O(Œµ^-2) through optimal learning rate choices and outperforms baseline MORL approaches in simulations using KuaiRand offline dataset.

Conclusion: MOCHA provides a theoretically grounded and practical method for exploring Pareto-stationary solutions in MORL, bridging a critical gap in the field while delivering superior performance.

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

*Amber Huang,Ian Scott Knight,Slava Naprienko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIT-PCBA, a dataset for virtual screening, is critically flawed with data leakage, duplication, and redundancy issues, making it unreliable for fair model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically audit LIT-PCBA, a commonly used benchmark in virtual screening, and identify issues that compromise its reliability and fairness.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic analysis of the dataset, identifying data leakage, redundancies, and duplication across training, validation, and query sets. They also implemented a memorization-based baseline to demonstrate the consequences of these flaws.

Result: The audit revealed significant dataset flaws, such as thousands of duplicated or structurally redundant entries. A trivial memorization-based model performed better than state-of-the-art models, highlighting the dataset's issues.

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA is unfit as a benchmark due to pervasive data flaws. The authors call for more rigorous dataset development and provide resources to help improve dataset reliability.

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

*Sujia Huang,Lele Fu,Zhen Cui,Tong Zhang,Na Song,Bo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new hierarchical rewiring strategy for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), inspired by torque in mechanics, aiming to enhance learning in challenging graph contexts like heterophilous or noisy graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN interactions often struggle with efficiency, especially in heterophilous graphs and noisy data, necessitating improved rewiring techniques for better learning outcomes.

Method: A torque-driven rewiring approach integrates structural distance and energy metrics to assess edge interference. The strategy includes pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, dynamically adapting the message-passing process.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, while also exhibiting robustness against noise.

Conclusion: The torque-driven hierarchical rewiring enhances GNN performance, providing better signal propagation, reduced noise interference, and improved representation learning in diverse graph settings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

*Kaiwen Chen,Xin Tan,Minchen Yu,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemShare, a method to optimize memory use and throughput in reasoning models by managing KV cache effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models tend to generate long reasoning steps, leading to high memory usage during inference, which the authors aim to address.

Method: The authors propose MemShare, using a collaborative filtering algorithm to reuse and efficiently manage KV cache, enabling zero-copy cache sharing.

Result: MemShare improves throughput by up to 84.79% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to current KV cache approaches.

Conclusion: MemShare is an effective solution for reducing memory overhead and enhancing throughput in reasoning models, achieving these benefits without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

### [265] [PVD-ONet: A Multi-scale Neural Operator Method for Singularly Perturbed Boundary Layer Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21437)
*Tiantian Sun,Jian Zu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PVD-Net and PVD-ONet, novel neural network frameworks specifically designed to solve singularly perturbed problems, outperforming existing methods in numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks often fail to handle singularly perturbed problems effectively. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The study proposes two frameworks: PVD-Net and PVD-ONet. PVD-Net comes in two versions for priorities in stability or high accuracy. PVD-ONet extends the functionality to operator learning by adapting multiple DeepONet modules.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrated that these methods consistently outperform existing baselines on multiple error metrics when applied to multi-scale problems.

Conclusion: PVD-Net and PVD-ONet provide effective tools for solving boundary layer problems, enhancing stability and accuracy while simplifying operator learning without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

### [266] [Latte: Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21494)
*Wenxuan Bao,Ruxi Deng,Ruizhong Qiu,Tianxin Wei,Hanghang Tong,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latte is a decentralized framework aimed at enhancing test-time adaptation using local and external memory mechanisms while addressing distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods struggle with limited test data in decentralized settings like federated learning, and fail to balance personalization and global sharing effectively.

Method: Latte introduces a local memory for storing historical test embeddings and an external memory for class prototypes shared among similar clients. These prototypes are retrieved with server coordination to expand memory, while adaptation is based on embedding similarity and uncertainty.

Result: Latte demonstrates robust performance across domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks in decentralized environments, minimizing communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: Latte is an effective framework addressing test-time adaptation challenges in decentralized setups, offering improved personalization and robustness.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

### [268] [Hierarchical Stochastic Differential Equation Models for Latent Manifold Learning in Neural Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21531)
*Pedram Rajaei,Maryam Ostadsharif Memar,Navid Ziaei,Behzad Nazari,Ali Yousefi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical stochastic differential equation model designed to uncover low-dimensional manifold structures from high-dimensional neural time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for uncovering latent structures in neural time series have limitations in balancing computational efficiency and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose a model employing Brownian bridge SDEs and a multivariate marked point process for latent space modeling, coupled with a second set of SDEs for mapping to observation data.

Result: The proposed model accurately recovers underlying manifold structures and scales well with high-dimensional neural data.

Conclusion: The model provides a computationally efficient and interpretable framework for modeling complex time series, validated on synthetic and neural datasets.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

*Kevin Doran,Tom Baden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using categorical probability distributions as neural network outputs for temporal point process models and demonstrates its competitiveness on extensive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand why simple output structures like categorical probability distributions are not commonly used in neural temporal point process models.

Method: They investigated existing datasets and models, extended datasets, created new ones, and assessed the performance of categorical distribution outputs in prediction tasks.

Result: Categorical probability distributions were found to perform competitively across a diverse range of datasets, especially when exploring beyond limited information regimes.

Conclusion: Simple categorical probability distributions are effective outputs for temporal point process modeling, challenging the reliance on complex model size and structured constraints.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

*Raiyan R. Khan,Philippe Chlenski,Itsik Pe'er*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces hyperbolic CNNs for genomic sequence modeling, achieving superior performance over Euclidean models and state-of-the-art DNA language models, while using fewer parameters and avoiding pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models fail to align well with the evolutionary-informed structure of biological systems, necessitating a novel approach to better genomic sequence representations.

Method: The paper adopts hyperbolic CNNs to model DNA sequences, which circumvent explicit phylogenetic mapping but capture functional and regulatory sequence properties effectively.

Result: Hyperbolic models outperformed Euclidean counterparts across the majority of genome benchmarks and surpassed state-of-the-art models on GUE benchmark datasets with efficient parameter usage.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic CNNs represent a promising paradigm for genome representation learning due to their robust performance, evolutionary alignment, and efficient modeling.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

### [271] [DGP: A Dual-Granularity Prompting Framework for Fraud Detection with Graph-Enhanced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21653)
*Yuan Li,Jun Hu,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-Enhanced LLMs are applied to fraud detection by converting graph information into textual prompts. The proposed Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP) method addresses performance degradation due to information overload in dense fraud-detection graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively using graph learning techniques with rich textual data in real-world fraud detection applications. Current text-only prompting struggles with overwhelming information in dense graphs, impacting performance.

Method: Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP) mitigates information overload by preserving detailed information for the target node and summarizing neighbor data into concise prompts through semantic abstraction for text and statistical aggregation for numerical features.

Result: DGP improves fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods while efficiently utilizing token resources.

Conclusion: Graph-Enhanced LLMs with DGP can effectively handle information challenges in fraud detection applications, demonstrating significant potential in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

### [272] [Probabilistic Consistency in Machine Learning and Its Connection to Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21670)
*Paul Patrone,Anthony Kearsley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between machine learning models and uncertainty quantification, developing a level-set theory to better understand classification and probabilistic interpretations of ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty of quantifying confidence in predictions made by ML models due to their black-box nature and the need to understand the mathematical connections between these models and the training data.

Method: The paper derives a level-set theory for classification and examines binary and multiclass Bayes classifiers, investigating properties such as boundary sets, density ratios, and prevalence that lead to probabilistic interpretations of ML models.

Result: It demonstrates that certain ML models can be equated with class-conditional probability distributions and provides tools for tasks such as uncertainty estimation and multiclass classifier construction.

Conclusion: The analysis presents a foundational framework that ties ML models to uncertainty quantification and lays down necessary conditions for these models to have valid probabilistic interpretations.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREIG, a deep learning framework combining GRU architecture and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) tailored for accurate and interpretable commodity demand forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commodity demand forecasting is challenging due to volatile markets, nonlinear dynamics, and the need for predictions consistent with economic theory.

Method: The model integrates Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with physics-informed constraints enforcing negative elasticity between price and demand using a customized loss function. Hybrid optimization involving NAdam, L-BFGS, and Population-Based Training (POP) is applied.

Result: PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric and deep learning models in RMSE and MAPE, demonstrating superior predictive performance and interpretability across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: PREIG offers a scalable and robust solution for economic time series forecasting by effectively combining domain knowledge, optimization theory, and deep learning.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

*Gang Wang,Peng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel neural network-based model to predict the thermodynamic properties of next-generation refrigerants, hydrofluoroolefins, leveraging molecular structure and machine learning insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable thermodynamic data for hydrofluoroolefins, which hinders their discovery and application despite their low global warming potential.

Method: The model combines a graph neural network with extended corresponding state theory. It is designed to generalize well by leveraging microscopic molecular structures and trained using accurate datasets validated through leave-one-out cross-validation.

Result: The model demonstrated improved predictive accuracy compared to traditional models, with low deviations in density and energy properties in both liquid and supercritical regions.

Conclusion: This approach effectively combines physical knowledge with machine learning, offering a tool to accelerate the discovery of innovative hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ZS-PAG, a framework for machine unlearning in a zero-shot scenario where only samples to be unlearned are available, addressing the challenge of over-unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods rely on remaining data to prevent over-unlearning, but scenarios where only unlearning samples are available are common in practice.

Method: ZS-PAG uses adversarial samples to substitute the inaccessible remaining data, locates a subspace for unlearning to avoid over-unlearning, and employs influence-based pseudo-labeling to enhance model performance post-unlearning.

Result: The proposed ZS-PAG method showed theoretical guarantees and outperformed existing baselines in various benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: ZS-PAG effectively tackles over-unlearning in zero-shot scenarios, improving both theoretical reliability and empirical performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempRe, a framework that redefines template-based retrosynthesis planning as sequence generation, achieving scalability, flexibility, and chemical validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning is difficult due to the immense and complex space of chemical reactions, with existing template-based and template-free methods facing challenges like poor scalability and invalid generation.

Method: TempRe reformulates template-based retrosynthesis as sequence generation and evaluates its performance on single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks.

Result: TempRe outperforms template classification and SMILES-based methods, achieving strong results on the PaRoutes benchmark and demonstrating efficiency in generating multi-step synthesis routes.

Conclusion: Template generative modeling has high potential as an efficient paradigm for computer-aided synthesis planning, as exemplified by TempRe's performance.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RF-CRATE, a mathematically interpretable deep network for RF sensing, leveraging complex sparse rate reduction, achieving performance comparable to black-box models while ensuring interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Deep Wireless Sensing (DWS) models lack interpretability, limiting generalizability and raising concerns in security-sensitive applications.

Method: The paper develops RF-CRATE, a complex-valued white-box transformer using the CR-Calculus framework and introduces Subspace Regularization to enhance feature diversity.

Result: RF-CRATE achieves an average performance improvement of 19.98% across tasks, with a classification gain of 5.08% and regression error reduction by 10.34%, compared to CRATE.

Conclusion: RF-CRATE balances interpretability and high performance in RF sensing, offering a pioneering approach grounded in mathematical rigor and validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) with novel stochastic models for optimizing CCS projects, aiming to improve economic viability and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combatting climate change and enhancing sustainability in the energy sector by optimizing decision variables in CCS projects.

Method: The paper uses Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes and other novel stochastic models to evaluate strategies for CCS project development.

Result: Implemented BO frameworks with alternative stochastic models that showcased improved performance in challenging optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: Bayesian Optimization, especially with innovative stochastic models, is a promising method for advancing CCS technologies while boosting economic and sustainable outcomes.

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

### [280] [Analysis of Fourier Neural Operators via Effective Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21833)
*Taeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper offers a systematic analysis of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) using effective field theory to delve into issues of stability, generalization, and frequency behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principled explanations for the stability, generalization, and frequency behavior of Fourier Neural Operators used in high-dimensional PDEs.

Method: An effective-field-theory approach is applied to analyze FNOs, deriving recursion relations for layer kernels and vertex functions under different network settings like activation types, scale invariance, and residual connections.

Result: The study shows frequency coupling induced by nonlinear activations, establishes explicit weight-initialization conditions for wide networks, and validates predictions via experiments.

Conclusion: Nonlinearity enhances feature learning in FNOs by coupling frequencies, and the paper provides criticality-based guidelines for hyper-parameter selection and explains the benefits of scale-invariant activations and residual connections.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

### [281] [Discovering Interpretable Ordinary Differential Equations from Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21841)
*Rahul Golder,M. M. Faruque Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for discovering interpretable models of physical systems using unsupervised parameter estimation, focusing on high accuracy and robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current data-driven discovery methods that often yield non-interpretable models with limited physical grounding.

Method: The methodology first finds an approximate solution using the form of linear ODEs, followed by spline transformation to estimate coefficients through gradient matrix linear systems.

Result: The approach accurately discovers governing ODEs, promotes sparsity without regularization, and is robust against noisy data.

Conclusion: The method enables reliable data-driven learning of physical dynamics, even in experimental settings with noise.

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a large cardiovascular disease dataset, identifying key risk factors and employing statistical and machine learning methods for prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading global cause of death, and understanding the influence of various factors on CVD occurrence is vital for prevention and management.

Method: The study used statistical tests (t-tests, Chi-square tests, ANOVA) and machine learning models (notably CatBoost) to analyze the dataset of 68,119 records.

Result: Risk factors like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol were identified, while factors like smoking showed unexpected results. The CatBoost model achieved high accuracy (0.734) and reliable probabilistic predictions.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the significance of certain risk factors and the need for better data preprocessing to improve model reliability.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a main cause of mortality globally,
accounting for 31% of all deaths. This study involves a cardiovascular disease
(CVD) dataset comprising 68,119 records to explore the influence of numerical
(age, height, weight, blood pressure, BMI) and categorical gender, cholesterol,
glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,
and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations
for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance
comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and
an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824).
Data challenges, including outliers and skewed distributions, indicate a need
for improved preprocessing to enhance predictive reliability.

TL;DR: DynamicMPNN is introduced as a model for designing protein sequences compatible with multiple conformations. It outperforms existing approaches in predicting multi-state proteins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of single-state design paradigms in modeling proteins that adopt multiple conformational states crucial for biological processes.

Method: Developed DynamicMPNN, a sequence design model trained on 46,033 conformational pairs using joint learning across conformational ensembles. Validations were done using AlphaFold predictions.

Result: DynamicMPNN showed up to 13% improvement in structure-normalized RMSD compared to ProteinMPNN on a multi-state protein benchmark.

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN provides an advanced inverse folding model for designing proteins that stabilize multiple conformations, improving over traditional methods within multi-state contexts.

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one
structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from
enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple
conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc
aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success
rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse
folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple
conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained
on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein
benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper presents an SLA-aware algorithm-selection framework using machine learning for optimization in cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure resource optimization and SLA adherence in cloud computing while minimizing SLA violations.

Method: Develop and evaluate a machine learning ensemble-based system for ranking algorithms-hardware pairs for SLA-constrained tasks, focusing on the 0-1 knapsack problem.

Result: A dataset is created with specific features; the framework is empirically tested, including hyperparameter studies and assessments involving SHAP analysis.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages machine learning techniques to enhance algorithm performance prediction and selection under SLA constraints.

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA
violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we
propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

*Zhuokun Chen,Zeren Chen,Jiahao He,Mingkui Tan,Jianfei Cai,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Stitch, a decoding framework that accelerates chain-of-thought reasoning in language models by switching between small and large models based on confidence, significantly reducing latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models improves problem-solving but also significantly increases computational costs due to long token sequences. Current acceleration methods have limitations such as limited speedup or inefficiencies in handling intermediate reasoning, motivating the need for a better approach.

Method: The R-Stitch framework uses a confidence-based mechanism to switch between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) during reasoning. It delegates token generation to the SLM by default and relies on the LLM only when the SLM's confidence is low. This approach minimizes computational overhead and maintains answer quality.

Result: R-Stitch demonstrated up to 85% reduction in inference latency with minimal accuracy loss in experiments conducted on math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: R-Stitch effectively accelerates chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models by leveraging confidence-based hybrid decoding, offering a balance of efficiency and quality. It is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with existing decoding pipelines.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

*Daniel R. Jiang,Alex Nikulkov,Yu-Chia Chen,Yang Bai,Zheqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the economic impact of reinforcement learning (RL) post-training in AI, particularly through the implementation of "AdLlama," a model that enhances ad performance on Facebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the economic implications of RL-trained large language models (LLMs) and evaluate their real-world effectiveness, especially in generative advertising.

Method: The study employed reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF) using historical ad performance data to optimize an LLM. The model was tested through a 10-week A/B study involving 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations.

Result: AdLlama improved click-through rates by 6.7% compared to a supervised model, demonstrating higher advertiser satisfaction and increased ad variations.

Conclusion: This study highlights the economic potential of RL-trained LLMs and validates RLPF as a robust post-training method for aligning language models with real-world tasks to achieve measurable outcomes.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

*Siddhartha Pradhan,Shikshya Shiwakoti,Neha Bathuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores improving adversarial attack transferability by using knowledge distillation from multiple teacher models, achieving comparable success rates to ensemble methods but with significantly reduced generation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate whether knowledge distillation can enhance the creation of transferable adversarial examples effectively and efficiently in black-box attack scenarios.

Method: The paper employs two KD strategies to train a student model with ResNet50 and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The adversarial examples generated by the student model are tested against a black-box target model using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks.

Result: Student models distilled from multiple teachers produced adversarial examples with success rates comparable to ensemble-based methods, while reducing generation time by a factor of six. Ablation studies found that lower temperatures and hard-label supervision improve transferability.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is effective not only for model compression but also for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of adversarial example generation in black-box settings.

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify honey's floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles, achieving high accuracy with the Random Forests classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize machine learning techniques for accurately identifying the origins of honey using its mineral content, which has discriminative properties.

Method: The study involves preprocessing (missing-value treatment, data normalization) and classification using supervised machine learning models. A publicly available dataset is used to test the approach.

Result: The Random Forests classifier achieved 99.30% accuracy in classifying floral origins and 98.01% in geographical source classification.

Conclusion: Using mineral element profiles in honey combined with machine learning methods, particularly Random Forests, yields highly accurate identification of honey's floral and geographical sources.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

*Alvaro Maggiar,Sohrab Andaz,Akhil Bagaria,Carson Eisenach,Dean Foster,Omer Gottesman,Dominique Perrault-Joncas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to classical inventory management scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and proposing enhancements for better policy interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of practical and data-driven inventory management solutions that avoid unrealistic assumptions about demand distributions, and aims to integrate DRL with traditional operations research insights.

Method: The authors implemented a DRL algorithm using DirectBackprop across diverse inventory scenarios and introduced a Structure-Informed Policy Network to enhance interpretability by incorporating known policy structures.

Result: The DRL method performed well against established benchmarks and heuristics, discovered structural properties of optimal policies, and demonstrated improved interpretability and robustness when using the Structure-Informed approach.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between data-driven DRL methods and analytical insights in inventory management, making the system both competitive and practically applicable.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

TL;DR: The paper explores using polynomial basis functions for parameterizing time-varying weights in continuous-time deep learning models, demonstrating improved stability, efficiency, and accuracy with Legendre polynomials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training continuous-time neural networks, specifically by improving weight stability and reducing computational costs.

Method: The study investigates time-varying weight parameterizations using polynomial basis functions (monomial and Legendre) in neural ODE and ResNet architectures, comparing discretize-then-optimize with optimize-then-discretize approaches.

Result: Legendre polynomial parameterizations led to improved training stability, reduced computational cost, and comparable or better accuracy than other parameterizations.

Conclusion: Choosing orthogonal polynomial bases like Legendre polynomials enhances the tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency for time-dependent weights.

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified ensemble framework for improving sales forecasting accuracy in real-world supply chains using hierarchical and architectural strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chains face challenges in demand forecasting due to domain shifts, hierarchical complexity, and evolving external factors.

Method: The authors introduce two ensemble strategies: Hierarchical Ensemble (HE) for localized pattern modeling and Architectural Ensemble (AE) for mitigating biases by combining diverse model architectures.

Result: Experiments on the M5 benchmark and external sales datasets show consistent improvement in forecasting accuracy using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances generalization and stability in challenging forecasting environments with a simple and robust approach.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces iHOMER, a framework for online multi-label classification that dynamically clusters labels and integrates drift detection, outperforming 17 baselines across 23 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in mining evolving data streams with high-dimensional multi-label outputs, including sparse labels, complex dependencies, and concept drift.

Method: iHOMER employs online clustering based on Jaccard similarity, hierarchical label partitioning, tree-based learning guided by the Bernoulli process, and drift detection mechanisms for adaptive model restructuring.

Result: Experiments across 23 datasets demonstrate iHOMER's superiority, achieving 23% better performance than 5 global baselines and 32% better than 12 local baselines.

Conclusion: iHOMER establishes a robust and adaptive approach suited for handling non-stationary, multi-label data streams in online learning scenarios.

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an alternative reservoir computing framework that is more sustainable and less energy-intensive compared to current integrating neuron-based approaches.

Method: The researchers introduced small-world networks of differentiating neurons that respond to changes in input. They optimized coupling strength and network topology for reservoir computing and tested the system with the MNIST digit recognition task.

Result: The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 90.65% on the MNIST task, comparable to traditional reservoir computing methods.

Conclusion: Differentiating neurons in small-world networks can effectively replace integrating neurons in reservoir computing, potentially offering a more energy-efficient solution for AI applications.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

*Daniel Szelogowski*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Engram Neural Network (ENN), which integrates explicit memory and Hebbian plasticity for improved interpretability compared to traditional recurrent networks, achieving comparable performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current artificial recurrent networks lack interpretability and struggle with long-range dependencies. Inspired by biological neural systems, this paper aims to enhance memory modeling and transparency in recurrent architectures.

Method: The authors propose the Engram Neural Network (ENN), incorporating explicit memory matrices with Hebbian plasticity and sparse, attention-based retrieval mechanisms to simulate memory formation and recall.

Result: ENN performs comparably to RNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures on tasks like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and WikiText-103, while providing significant interpretability through its observable memory dynamics and Hebbian trace visualizations.

Conclusion: The neuroscience-inspired ENN model demonstrates that explicit memory mechanisms enhance the interpretability of neural networks without compromising performance, validating its potential for robust, interpretable deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on

### [295] [Knowledge-Guided Memetic Algorithm for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21740)
*Qingya Li,Shengcai Liu,Wenjie Chen,Juan Zou,Ke Tang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces KGMA-GN, a memetic algorithm to improve search efficiency for CARPTDSC, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two challenges in CARPTDSC: its NP-hardness and computational inefficiency caused by time-dependent service costs.

Method: The authors propose a knowledge-guided memetic algorithm (KGMA-GN) utilizing knowledge-guided initialization and a small-step-size local search strategy to enhance the solution efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show that KGMA-GN outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, with significant runtime reductions for larger-scale instances.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge-based strategies improve CARPTDSC solutions by enhancing convergence speed and reducing computational overhead, particularly through the effective use of tailored local search operators.

Abstract: The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs
(CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from
winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time
consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent
service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,
significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it
difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often
resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively
correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are
introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided
initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial
solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size
local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby
reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental
results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale
instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that
the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce
runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided
swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper proposes an advanced multi-UAV communication network structure for emergency scenarios using integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology crucial for 6G networks. Key optimizations include beamforming, load management, and UAV direction planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for effective multi-UAV networks for emergency communication, leveraging ISAC technology to sense and enhance communication system performance in 6G networks.

Method: The paper introduces a temporal-assisted frame structure with omnidirectional and directional beampatterns, utilizes extended Kalman filtering for beam alignment, and jointly optimizes UAV beamforming, load management, and direction planning using numerical methods.

Result: Through simulations, the proposed methods exhibit improved system performance in communication rate, fairness, and sensing accuracy.

Conclusion: The study offers robust ISAC-based solutions and computation-enhancing mechanisms for UAV-assisted emergency communication design, showcasing significant improvements and providing guidance for deploying such networks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Airborne mobile Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) base stations
have garnered significant attention recently, with ISAC technology being a
crucial application for 6G networks. Since ISAC can sense potential mobile
communication users, this paper studies an effective scheme for a multi-UAV
network tailored for emergency communication. In this paper, we develop a
temporal-assisted frame structure utilizing integrated omnidirectional and
directional beampattern to facilitate efficient and frequent searching, with
extended Kalman filtering (EKF) as an aid to beam alignment. Further, we
address an optimization problem to maximize the total achievable rate per slot
by jointly designing UAV beamforming, load management, and UAV direction
planning, all while adhering to the constraints of the predicted beam coverage.
Given the problem NP-hard, we introduce three robust mechanisms for its
resolution: an enhanced distributed Successive Convex Approximation
(SCA)-Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM) algorithm, an coalition game approach,
and a Fermat point search method. In particular, the proposed SCA-IRM algorithm
decomposes the original complex optimization problem into several sub-problems
and assigns them equally to each UAV, so as to realize distributed computing
and improve computational efficiency. Our proposed simulations demonstrate the
improved system performance in terms of communication rate, fairness, and
sensing accuracy, providing design guidelines of UAV-assisted emergency
communication networking.

*Paulette Koronkevich,William J. Bowman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper examines Landin's Knot and shows how unrestricted quantification over a function's environment, combined with higher-order references, enables encoding recursion and non-termination in a terminating language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how higher-order references can lead to non-termination and whether restrictions can allow their safe use in terminating languages.

Method: Analyzed the principles of Landin's Knot using a closure converted language with explicit environments and impredicative quantification.

Result: Unrestricted quantification over the environment enables encoding recursion with higher-order references, but restrictions on quantification could prevent non-termination.

Conclusion: Higher-order references could be safely integrated into terminating languages by restricting environment quantification, without requiring complex type systems or restricting references from storing functions.

Abstract: In this work, we explore Landin's Knot, which is understood as a pattern for
encoding general recursion, including non-termination, that is possible after
adding higher-order references to an otherwise terminating language. We observe
that this isn't always true -- higher-order references, by themselves, don't
lead to non-termination. The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not
primarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification
over a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted
language, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the
type of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references
are added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode
recursion. We conjecture that by restricting the quantification over the
environment, higher-order references can be safely added to terminating
languages, without resorting to more complex type systems such as linearity,
and without restricting references from storing functions.

*Yong Qi Foo,Brian Sze-Kai Cheong,Michael D. Adams*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) introduces a paradigm simplifying the implementation of self-referential computational problems by using high-level abstractions and compiler optimizations, reducing complexity and enabling concise code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domains like graph algorithms and distributed computing rely on inherently complex fixed-point computations, which are inefficient and error-prone due to the lack of direct support in existing programming paradigms.

Method: FPOP enables developers to use high-level abstractions with structured inference rules and user-directed optimizations to create concise, declarative problem specifications. The compiler automates efficient execution.

Result: The paradigm drastically simplifies tasks such as the graph distance problem, reducing implementation code by an order of magnitude and facilitating maintainable, easily prototyped solutions.

Conclusion: FPOP bridges theoretical fixed-point concepts and practical implementation, streamlining computational programming while encouraging research and adoption of this innovative paradigm.

Abstract: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) is an emerging paradigm designed to
streamline the implementation of problems involving self-referential
computations. These include graph algorithms, static analysis, parsing, and
distributed computing-domains that traditionally require complex and
tricky-to-implement work-queue algorithms. Existing programming paradigms lack
direct support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to
inefficient and error-prone implementations.
  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a
high-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem
formulations. By leveraging structured inference rules and user-directed
optimizations, FPOP allows developers to write declarative specifications while
the compiler ensures efficient execution. It not only reduces implementation
complexity for programmers but also enhances adaptability, making it easier for
programmers to explore alternative solutions and optimizations without
modifying the core logic of their program.
  We demonstrate how FPOP simplifies algorithm implementation, improves
maintainability, and enables rapid prototyping by allowing problems to be
clearly and concisely expressed. For example, the graph distance problem can be
expressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes an
order of magnitude more code in other paradigms. By bridging the gap between
theoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, we aim to
foster further research and adoption of this paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-integrated scripts are often tightly bound to specific implementations, limiting modularity and failing to capitalize on parallelization opportunities.

Method: The paper proposes separating workflow logic from effectful operations (e.g., LLM calls, I/O, concurrency) using composable effect handling, treating them as abstract interfaces, and managing them with effect handlers.

Result: Significant performance improvements are showcased, such as a 10√ó speedup in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study, without compromising modularity.

Conclusion: Composable effect handling is advocated as a flexible and efficient programming style for addressing challenges in LLM-based scripting.

Abstract: Implementing LLM-integrated scripts introduces challenges in modularity and
performance, as scripts are often coupled to specific LLM implementations and
fail to exploit parallelization opportunities. This paper proposes using
composable effect handling to separate workflow logic from effectful
operations, such as LLM calls, I/O, and concurrency, enabling modularity
without sacrificing the opportunity for performance optimization. By treating
these operations as abstract interfaces and discharging them via effect
handlers, this paper shows that scripts can achieve significant speedups (e.g.,
10$\times$ in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study) without compromising modularity.
This paper aims to promote composable effect handling as a programming style
for LLM scripting.

Conclusion: The tactile sensor presents a simple, scalable, and durable solution for robotic manipulation, offering new opportunities for adaptable and versatile robotic applications in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass system to enhance heading angle determination using low-cost gyroscopes, offering promising improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring accurate and timely heading estimation in scenarios with low-cost gyroscopes and no external navigation aids is challenging due to size, weight, and power constraints and noisy measurements.

Method: The authors integrate a diffusion-based denoising framework with a deep learning-based heading estimation model. The denoiser preprocesses inertial sensor data before being fed into the learning model for gyrocompassing.

Result: Tests with simulated and real sensor data revealed a 26% improvement over model-based methods and a 15% improvement over other learning-based methods in gyrocompassing accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances navigation accuracy for low-cost gyroscope systems, making it especially beneficial for autonomous vehicle platforms facing operational constraints.

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of making NMPC computationally feasible on microcontrollers, which are typically limited in resources.

Method: The authors developed a computationally optimized scheme specifically for deploying NMPC, balancing computational demands with control accuracy.

Result: Simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that the method enables high-frequency NMPC execution in real-time systems, particularly for quadrotors.

Conclusion: The study shows that it is practical to execute full-fledged NMPC on microcontrollers for dynamic robotics applications, offering both computational efficiency and high control performance.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful approach for
controlling highly dynamic robotic systems, as it accounts for system dynamics
and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational
complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
impractical. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of Model
Predictive Control (MPC) with linearized dynamics on microcontrollers, applying
full NMPC remains a significant challenge. This work presents an efficient
solution for generating and deploying NMPC on microcontrollers (NMPCM) to
control quadrotor UAVs. The proposed method optimizes computational efficiency
while maintaining high control accuracy. Simulations in Gazebo/ROS and

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for advanced autonomous exploration systems capable of leveraging both aerial and terrestrial modalities, while managing the inherent limitations of energy consumption and time availability.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical exploration system involving region identification, viewpoint generation, and an extended Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize modality and sequence planning, paired with a bimodal motion planner for deployment.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments using a customized bimodal vehicle demonstrate the capability and efficiency of the proposed exploration framework.

Conclusion: The presented framework enables effective energy- and time-aware exploration in autonomous vehicles, showcasing its potential through validated tests and applications.

Abstract: Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles, which integrate the high mobility of
aerial robots with the long endurance of ground robots, offer significant
potential for autonomous exploration. Given the inherent energy and time
constraints in practical exploration tasks, we present a hierarchical framework
for the bimodal vehicle to utilize its flexible locomotion modalities for
exploration. Beginning with extracting environmental information to identify
informative regions, we generate a set of potential bimodal viewpoints. To
adaptively manage energy and time constraints, we introduce an extended Monte
Carlo Tree Search approach that strategically optimizes both modality selection
and viewpoint sequencing. Combined with an improved bimodal vehicle motion
planner, we present a complete bimodal energy- and time-aware exploration
system. Extensive simulations and deployment on a customized real-world

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how wearable robotic legs influence human gait and perceived body image, identifying discrepancies between actual and perceived motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how training with wearable robotic legs affects gait, perceived body image, and how users adapt to such devices.

Method: Utilized SCoMo to measure gait and perceived body image after training sessions, based on human motor learning theory applied to wearer-robot systems.

Result: Training improved physical and perceived gait, but discrepancies between actual and perceived motion persisted, with overestimation occurring during later sessions.

Conclusion: Calibrating perception and enhancing human sensory integration with wearable robots are crucial for effective training and developing better assistive technologies.

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human
motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability,
and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived
body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each
training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot
systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking
with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more
certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor
learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,
indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into
their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.
However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,
likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis
from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training
sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that
enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating
perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb
wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

Motivation: To enable precise sound source localization in noisy environments for enhanced interaction between unmanned ground vehicles and human operators.

Method: Combines signal coarse alignment, time-domain acoustic echo cancellation, and ideal ratio mask estimation to isolate target speech for selective sound localization.

Result: Achieves average angle error of 4 degrees and 95% accuracy within 5 degrees at 1dB signal-to-noise ratio, outperforming current localization methods.

Conclusion: The method provides effective selective sound source localization in challenging acoustic scenarios, improving robot interaction capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a
microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous
close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy
is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate
a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from
interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source
localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound
from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios.
Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within
5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly
superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

TL;DR: The study explores the use of soft robots' nonlinear dynamics in physical reservoir computing, enabling multibehavior control and revealing untrained attractors that could advance embodied AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the nonlinear body-environment dynamics of soft robots for information processing and motor signal generation, expanding it to control multiple behaviors and uncovering unexplored potentials in embodied AI.

Method: A simulation was conducted using a tensegrity robot to embed multiple behaviors by exploiting its multistable dynamical properties and analyzing its attractor dynamics.

Result: The system showed multistable dynamics with different attractors representing behaviors, including untrained attractors that arise from intrinsic robot characteristics and interactions with the environment.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how untrained attractors and multistable dynamics in physical reservoir computing can advance the understanding and design of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

*Chang-Hun Ji,SiWoon Song,Youn-Hee Han,SungTae Moon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a drone trajectory planner that uses a single "Return-to-Go (RTG)" parameter to dynamically adjust safety and efficiency trade-offs in unknown environments without requiring expert knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drone trajectory planners either lack adaptability for safety-efficiency trade-offs in unknown environments or require expert tuning that may not deliver desired outcomes.

Method: The authors propose a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner employing RTG as a dynamic, intuitive parameter to adjust safety and efficiency trade-offs. The method was validated in Gazebo simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: The proposed planner successfully adjusted safety-efficiency trade-offs by tuning RTG and outperformed existing methods in simulation experiments. It also demonstrated robustness and adaptability in real-world tests.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical, efficient, and flexible trajectory planning for drones, eliminating the need for intricate expert tuning and proving effective in varying configurations and environments.

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

TL;DR: The paper presents LITE, a novel learning-integrated framework for multi-floor indoor exploration, combining topological decomposition and efficient 2D policy mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-floor indoor exploration remains a challenging and open area in robotics research, especially with the limitations of current learning-based explorers often confined to 2D environments. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors introduced LITE, which utilizes topological decomposition to divide environments into floor-stair structures, combining YOLO11-based segmentation and an attention-based 2D exploration policy to efficiently navigate multiple floors.

Result: Experiments on HM3D and MP3D datasets reveal superior exploration efficiency of their 2D policy over baselines. The framework also proved compatibility across a range of 2D methods and successfully validated its approach using a quadruped robot in real-world environments.

Conclusion: LITE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for multi-floor exploration, bridging the gap between 2D explorers and 3D environments, paving the way for more adaptable exploration methods in robotics.

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open
area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based
explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust
environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D
environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological
explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the
environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of
learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we
incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based
instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a
finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D
exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial
dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global
goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies
conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D
exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor
environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D
exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.
Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,
highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to unify imitation learning and planning approaches by integrating a planning-based agent into Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). It shows significant improvements in efficiency, generalization, and robustness, tested on simulation and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human demonstration data often lacks clarity and completeness, which motivates the need for imitation learning methods that incorporate reliable planning capabilities.

Method: The authors replace the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent, leveraging connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning to enable end-to-end learning from observation-only demonstrations.

Result: Experimental results revealed superior sample efficiency, better out-of-distribution generalization, and increased robustness in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of planning into IRL presents advantages in terms of interpretability, complexity reduction, safety, and performance improvements, making it effective for learning from sparse observation data.

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

*Haoming Ye,Yunxiao Xiao,Cewu Lu,Panpan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniDomain, a framework for robotic task planning using pre-trained PDDL domains derived from manipulation demonstrations, enabling zero-shot generalization and outperforming LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic task planning methods lack generalization and symbolic grounding for complex tasks across language and vision, prompting the need for a more adaptable framework.

Method: UniDomain pre-trains PDDL domains from manipulation video demonstrations, extracts atomic domains, and combines them into meta-domains tailored to specific tasks for reasoning and generalization.

Result: UniDomain demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to 58% better task success rates and 160% improvement in planning optimality compared to leading LLM and LLM-PDDL solutions.

Conclusion: The UniDomain framework overcomes limitations in existing robotic task planning by enabling compositional generalization and solving complex unseen tasks, establishing its effectiveness and adaptability.

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over
implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong
priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding.
Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on
handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a
framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations
and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains
from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators,
2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it
retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses
them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in
planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves
complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task
success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and
LLM-PDDL baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper studies multi-robot SLAM limitations, identifies false positives in loop detection, and proposes a heuristic for improvement, focusing on underground tunnels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the limitations of current decentralized LiDAR SLAM systems and address the issue of frequent false positives in loop detection, especially in challenging environments like underground tunnels.

Method: The authors study the pipeline of decentralized LiDAR SLAM, identify limitations, and propose a heuristic solution to minimize false positives in loop detection.

Result: A new heuristic is introduced for improving loop detection accuracy in decentralized LiDAR SLAM systems. The paper also highlights under-explored research areas.

Conclusion: The proposed heuristic addresses identified failure points in SLAM systems, especially in underground environments, and opens avenues for further exploration of under-researched areas.

Abstract: Multi-robot SLAM aims at localizing and building a map with multiple robots,
interacting with each other. In the work described in this article, we analyze
the pipeline of a decentralized LiDAR SLAM system to study the current
limitations of the state of the art, and we discover a significant source of
failures, i.e., that the loop detection is the source of too many false
positives. We therefore develop and propose a new heuristic to overcome these
limitations. The environment taken as reference in this work is the highly
challenging case of underground tunnels. We also highlight potential new
research areas still under-explored.

Result: Over 30 global teams participated, creating benchmarks and addressing issues like fusion, multi-agent planning, and sensor integration.

Conclusion: The challenge advanced scalable, reliable V2X-cooperative systems and identified key technical challenges and solutions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and

*Haolan Zhang,Thanh Nguyen Canh,Chenghao Li,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework to enhance SLAM performance in dynamic environments by assessing SLAM reliability and refining pose estimation using reliable reference frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM struggles with localization drift in dynamic environments due to assumptions of static scenes and challenges from abrupt viewpoint changes and moving objects.

Method: A scene-object-based reliability assessment framework is proposed, along with a pose refinement strategy that uses reliable reference frames to optimize camera pose estimation.

Result: The method shows substantial improvements in localization accuracy and robustness under dynamic conditions, as demonstrated by experiments on TUM RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates issues in SLAM caused by dynamic interference, improving both stability and accuracy in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a vital role in
real-time localization for autonomous systems. However, traditional SLAM
methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant
localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have
improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle
with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and
poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively
evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene
changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes
unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information
from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of dynamic interference. Extensive experiments on the TUM
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements
in localization accuracy and system robustness under challenging dynamic
scenarios.

*Yuda Chen,Shuaikang Wang,Jie Li,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses reliable communication for UAVs in obstacle-heavy areas by proposing methods for network design and motion coordination with connectivity guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of reliable UAV communication in environments with obstructions, ensuring network connectivity during motion and minimizing UAV requirements.

Method: Introduces a minimum-edge RRT* algorithm for network design and distributed model predictive control for collision-free motion coordination ensuring LOS connectivity.

Result: Simulations in 3D environments and hardware experiments confirm dynamic adaptability and connectivity maintenance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods reliably enable UAV deployment with guaranteed connectivity and collision-free operations in obstacle-cluttered environments.

Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating
within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to
obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to
relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i)
how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain
connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes
an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm,
to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the
deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model
predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It
explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance
constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These
constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various
approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that
all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS
connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like
environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when
the deployment position changes online.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents MoDeSuite, a benchmark suite of eight mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects, aimed at advancing robot learning for such challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot learning algorithms struggle with manipulating deformable objects, and there is a lack of standardized benchmarks for these tasks in mobile manipulation.

Method: The authors created MoDeSuite with eight tasks designed to test robot learning algorithms on manipulating objects with varying degrees of deformability, using both reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods for evaluation.

Result: Performance tests with state-of-the-art algorithms highlight the challenges of the tasks, and successful transfer of policies to real-world robots (like Spot) demonstrates sim-to-real applicability.

Conclusion: MoDeSuite provides the first focused benchmark suite for mobile manipulation of deformable objects, potentially sparking new research in this field.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

*Yicheng Guo,Chengkai Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Hao Zhang,Peng Hang,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes ExamPPO, a testing framework to evaluate autonomous vehicles (AVs) adaptively and systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing testing methods for AVs are limited by their dependence on high-quality data, poor interaction dynamics, and low robustness.

Method: The paper introduces ExamPPO, utilizing intelligent surrounding vehicle modeling with a multi-head attention network and an adversarial confrontation factor to adjust test difficulty and behaviors.

Result: Experiments show that ExamPPO effectively exposes weaknesses in AV decision-making and generalizes across scenarios.

Conclusion: ExamPPO is a robust solution for evaluating AV safety and intelligence in diverse and interactive scenarios.

Abstract: Scientific testing techniques are essential for ensuring the safe operation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with high-risk, highly interactive scenarios
being a primary focus. To address the limitations of existing testing methods,
such as their heavy reliance on high-quality test data, weak interaction
capabilities, and low adversarial robustness, this paper proposes ExamPPO, an
interactive adversarial testing framework that enables scenario-adaptive and
intensity-controllable evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The framework models
the Surrounding Vehicle (SV) as an intelligent examiner, equipped with a
multi-head attention-enhanced policy network, enabling context-sensitive and
sustained behavioral interventions. A scalar confrontation factor is introduced
to modulate the intensity of adversarial behaviors, allowing continuous,
fine-grained adjustment of test difficulty. Coupled with structured evaluation
metrics, ExamPPO systematically probes AV's robustness across diverse scenarios
and strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios and AV
strategies demonstrate that ExamPPO can effectively modulate adversarial
behavior, expose decision-making weaknesses in tested AVs, and generalize
across heterogeneous environments, thereby offering a unified and reproducible
solution for evaluating the safety and intelligence of autonomous
decision-making systems.

*Michael Kaiser,Clemens Gro√ü,Lisa Marie Otto,Steffen M√ºller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper validates a test environment where real cyclists interact with automated vehicles safely via a virtual environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a realistic and safe testing setup for interactions between automated driving systems and vulnerable road users like cyclists.

Method: Developed a coupled test setup integrating Cyclist-in-the-Loop and Vehicle-in-the-Loop systems using Unreal Engine 5, enabling real-time interactions via a virtual environment.

Result: Validated this test setup using real interactions between automated shuttle buses and stationary cyclists in a virtual environment for different test scenarios. Measured performance and identified latencies.

Conclusion: The test setup is feasible for realistic ADS evaluations, with noted strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with
vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the
safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a
coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test
bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)
developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional
interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under
safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist
gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary
bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation
experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a
track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line
driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a
proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance
is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both
environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components
in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS
evaluation.

*Dominic Guri,George Kantor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a design optimization framework to enhance robot manipulator performance in agricultural environments, demonstrating improvements in reachability and dexterity for pepper harvesting robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The design and placement of manipulators in cluttered agricultural environments, such as for harvesting high-value crops, are traditionally intuitive and challenging, limiting automation adoption.

Method: The paper introduces a four-part framework: a design model, simulation-based environment and task representations, performance metrics, and optimization algorithms. It also employs novel metrics based on self-motion manifolds.

Result: Demonstrated on a dual-arm robot for pepper harvesting, the methodology achieved a 14% improvement in reachability success and a 30% enhancement in dexterity.

Conclusion: The framework streamlines the design of task-specific robotic systems, enabling significant performance improvements and potentially accelerating robotic automation in agriculture.

Abstract: One major recurring challenge in deploying manipulation robots is determining
the optimal placement of manipulators to maximize performance. This challenge
is exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value
crops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from
robotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of
such systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the
affordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like
farmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization
methodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.
This framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment
representations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)
optimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our
framework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using
two off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce
novel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize
manipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework
achieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and
improvements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability
success by at least 14\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\%
improvement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric.

### [319] [ODE Methods for Computing One-Dimensional Self-Motion Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21957)
*Dominic Guri,George Kantor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel ODE-based approach to compute self-motion manifolds (SMMs), providing global IK solutions for redundant manipulators, and addresses challenges in both redundancy induction and finding disconnected SMM components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Redundant manipulators offer flexibility for auxiliary tasks, but traditional IK solvers only return locally optimal solutions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors developed an ODE-based formulation to compute self-motion manifolds using fixed-step ODE integrators, covering both redundant and induced redundancy cases. They also proposed methods to explore disconnected SMM components and extended their approach to prismatic joint systems.

Result: Their approach computes accurate SMMs globally without additional IK refinement and covers areas not addressed in the current literature, including prismatic joint systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust and comprehensive way to compute global IK solutions and address challenges in redundancy and disconnected solution spaces, with demonstrated practical examples.

Abstract: Redundant manipulators are well understood to offer infinite joint
configurations for achieving a desired end-effector pose. The multiplicity of
inverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of
auxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most
widely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that
inherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the
computation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all
joint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant
manipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We
focus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE
formulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE
integrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in
otherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by
one degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,
recognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we
propose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our
formulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring
additional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems
-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the
derivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work
and their limitations.

Motivation: Retinal vein occlusion is a major cause of vision impairment, but current manual retinal vein cannulation methods face challenges such as vein fragility and precision demands, necessitating robotic aid.

Method: The researchers designed an automated robotic system incorporating a top-down microscope, OCT imaging for depth sensing, and deep learning models for real-time needle navigation and vein puncture detection.

Result: The system demonstrated an 85% accuracy in detecting needle position and puncture events and reduced navigation and puncture times compared to manual techniques.

Conclusion: Integrating imaging technologies and deep learning into microsurgical robotics shows promise for safer, consistent, and efficient retinal vein cannulation, paving the way for improved vision restoration procedures.

Abstract: Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a minimally invasive microsurgical
procedure for treating retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a leading cause of vision
impairment. However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled
with the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create
significant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for
robotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an
automated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep
learning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,
and vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for
human retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and
puncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable
reductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep
learning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and
more reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework for quadrupedal robots with manipulators, showcasing its robustness in loco-manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling complex loco-manipulation tasks for legged robots with high degrees of freedom requires computationally efficient trajectory optimization methods.

Method: The framework utilizes a decomposition strategy coupling locomotion template models with a full-order manipulator dynamic model, solved in real-time at 60 Hz, and integrates a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller running at 500 Hz.

Result: The system was validated on a Unitree Go2 robot with a Kinova arm, showing robustness in various conditions such as external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrains.

Conclusion: The NMPC framework effectively manages non-negligible manipulator dynamics and achieves real-time performance, ensuring reliable loco-manipulation for quadrupedal robots.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models
has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged
locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots
introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC
algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter
presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored
for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic
manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the
quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples
locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with
a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.
This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in
a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories
generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear
whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque
commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control
architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg
4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible
relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust
stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling
external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.

### [323] [Generating Highly Structured Test Inputs Leveraging Constraint-Guided Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21271)
*Zhaorui Yang,Yuxin Qiu,Haichao Zhu,Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRAphRef, a graph-based input generation framework for structured AI data, aiming to improve input validity and semantic preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for generating test inputs for structured data lack generalizability and often produce invalid inputs, negatively impacting their efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce GRAphRef, which maps structured inputs to graphs, applies guided mutations, and uses constraints to repair invalid inputs. It is compared against other methods using real-world mesh-processing AI systems.

Result: The paper claims to enhance structural validity and semantic preservation when generating inputs for AI systems, with experiments across eight systems to validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: A graph-based representation can unify test input generation for structured domains, improving validity and adaptability compared to specific handcrafted tools.

Abstract: [Context] Modern AI applications increasingly process highly structured data,
such as 3D meshes and point clouds, where test input generation must preserve
both structural and semantic validity. However, existing fuzzing tools and
input generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often
generate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to
inefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates
whether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based
representation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing
structural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in
enhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.
[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation
framework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps
structured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and
uses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a
confirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,
comparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.
Evaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via
prediction consistency), and performance overhead. Experimental data is derived
from ShapeNetCore mesh seeds and model outputs from systems like MeshCNN and
HodgeNet. Statistical analysis and component latency breakdowns will be used to
assess each hypothesis.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the uneven adoption of generative AI tools by software developers and identifies key behavioral patterns and organizational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why developers demonstrate differing levels of adoption for generative AI tools despite their increasing availability.

Method: Conducted paired interviews with 54 developers from 27 teams, analyzing behaviors by comparing frequent and infrequent users.

Result: Identified differing perceptions of the tool (collaborator vs. feature), engagement (experimental vs. conservative), and challenge responses (adaptive persistence vs. quick abandonment) as factors influencing adoption.

Conclusion: Organizational expectations for immediate productivity gains without adequate learning support create a 'Productivity Pressure Paradox,' deterring the full realization of generative AI tool benefits.

Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of generative AI tools in software
engineering, developer adoption remains uneven. This unevenness is problematic
because it hampers productivity efforts, frustrates management's expectations,
and creates uncertainty around the future roles of developers. Through paired
interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams -- one frequent and one
infrequent user per team -- we demonstrate that differences in usage result
primarily from how developers perceive the tool (as a collaborator vs.
feature), their engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and how
they respond when encountering challenges (with adaptive persistence vs. quick
abandonment). Our findings imply that widespread organizational expectations
for rapid productivity gains without sufficient investment in learning support
creates a "Productivity Pressure Paradox," undermining the very productivity
benefits that motivate adoption.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to amplify elusive bugs in concurrent systems using model-based predictive techniques, which outperform brute-force random sampling in effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency bugs manifest rarely and under specific conditions, making them hard to reproduce and debug consistently.

Method: The system under test is treated as a black-box, and a predictive model is trained via repeated executions to estimate the likelihood of bugs triggered by various inputs. This approach leverages regression models to search for bug-inducing configurations.

Result: The method, deployed on 17 representative concurrency bugs, achieved significant amplification of bug occurrence rates, often by an order of magnitude compared to random sampling.

Conclusion: The research presents an innovative bug amplification strategy using regression models, offering a practical, non-invasive framework for detecting rare concurrency issues effectively.

Abstract: Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce
because they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter
failures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low
probability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of
such elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use
repeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the
probability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this
approach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse
categories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a
brute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of
regression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly
all scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random
sampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of
bug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical
evaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating
the effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive
testing framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults
without altering the internal system architecture.

### [326] [Does Editing Improve Answer Quality on Stack Overflow? A Data-Driven Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21329)
*Saikat Mondal,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of accepted edits on Python Q&A answers on Stack Overflow, revealing both improvements and drawbacks across various quality dimensions such as relevance, usability, and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether accepted edits on Stack Overflow improve critical quality dimensions of answers, addressing a gap in earlier studies which primarily focused on rejected edits or specific topics.

Method: Analyzed 94,994 Python-related answers on Stack Overflow with accepted edits for six dimensions: semantic relevance, code usability, code complexity, security vulnerabilities, code optimization, and readability.

Result: The study found mixed outcomes: 53.3% of edits improved relevance, but 38.1% decreased it; 9% of broken code was fixed, but 14.7% of working code became non-parsable; complexity and security issues worsened in many cases despite performance optimizations.

Conclusion: Edits have both positive and negative impacts, highlighting the need for better moderation and caution in collaborative systems to ensure improved quality and efficiency rather than degradation.

Abstract: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) are
crucial as they directly influence software development practices. Poor-quality
answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and
thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To
improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise
answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have
examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior
research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key
quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++
vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we
analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to
determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)
code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)
readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.
While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them
less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working
code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity
(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,
20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize
performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,
as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the
inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact
software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and
moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems.

### [327] [MAAD: Automate Software Architecture Design through Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21382)
*Ruiyin Li,Yiran Zhang,Xiyu Zhou,Peng Liang,Weisong Sun,Jifeng Xuan,Zhi Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design) is a framework employing specialized agents to automate and enhance software architecture design. It outperforms MetaGPT and has been validated through case studies and feedback from industry experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in software architecture design, including its complexity, reliance on human architects, and limitations under agile development pressures.

Method: Proposed the MAAD framework, which consists of four specialized agents (Analyst, Modeler, Designer, Evaluator) working collaboratively to produce architectural blueprints and evaluate them based on quality attributes. Evaluated the framework against MetaGPT and tested it with different LLMs.

Result: MAAD outperformed MetaGPT in producing detailed architectural components and evaluation reports. Feedback from industry professionals validated its practical usability. GPT-4o was found to be the best-performing LLM.

Conclusion: MAAD demonstrates a practical and effective approach for automating software architecture design, highlighting the importance of selecting the right LLM in MAS-driven frameworks.

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

*Zachariah Sollenberger,Rahul Patel,Saieda Ali Zada,Sunita Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-LLM system using generative and discriminative models to generate and verify compiler tests, addressing hallucinations and reasoning concerns in LLM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like hallucinations and lack of logical trust in LLM outputs while leveraging their potential in software and test development.

Method: Implementation of a dual-LLM framework with generative and discriminative models, experimenting across multiple metrics to assess efficacy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the potential of LLMs in generating reliable compiler tests and autonomously verifying their correctness.

Conclusion: Dual-LLM systems show promising prospects for improving software verification tasks and mitigating common LLM limitations.

Abstract: The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development
has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently
have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness
of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have
been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet.
Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems
without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to
explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their
results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply
LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a
discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation
of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs
possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten
carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through
our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to
generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.

### [329] [HLSDebugger: Identification and Correction of Logic Bugs in HLS Code with LLM Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21485)
*Jing Wang,Shang Liu,Yao Lu,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HLSDebugger enhances HLS debugging by generating a large dataset and utilizing a tailored encoder-decoder model, significantly outperforming advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the debugging process of HLS code, which is challenging due to limited hardware domain knowledge among designers and the inherent complexity of hardware debugging.

Method: HLSDebugger employs a specialized encoder-decoder model and introduces a new dataset with 300K labeled samples to tackle HLS bugs. The model simultaneously handles bug location identification, bug type prediction, and correction.

Result: HLSDebugger exceeds the performance of GPT-4, particularly excelling in bug correction by more than 3x and achieving significant improvements in bug identification.

Conclusion: Customized solutions like HLSDebugger, with substantial datasets and tailored models, are effective in advancing automated debugging for HLS code, addressing key challenges faced in the process.

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

### [330] [Ethical Classification of Non-Coding Contributions in Open-Source Projects via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21583)
*Sergio Cobos,Javier Luis C√°novas Izquierdo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to evaluate ethical quality in non-coding OSS contributions using Large Language Models (LLMs) and ethical metrics based on the Contributor Covenant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address ethical challenges in social coding platforms, which risk the sustainability of OSS projects. They sought to improve the enforcement of codes of conduct through automated and effective methods.

Method: The approach uses ethical metrics derived from the Contributor Covenant and large language models (LLMs) with prompt engineering to classify ethical quality in OSS non-coding contributions.

Result: The paper developed a framework for assessing ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, demonstrating the potential application of LLMs for such evaluations.

Conclusion: Deploying LLMs to monitor OSS activities can enhance the sustainability of projects by identifying and fostering ethical behavior in collaborative environments.

Abstract: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) is not only a technical
challenge, but also a social one due to the diverse mixture of contributors. To
this aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure
needed to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the
community's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as
issues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing
contributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process
faces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.
To foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly
deploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and
inclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the
main model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct
is a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this
paper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding
contributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a
promising technology for text classification tasks. We defined a set of ethical
metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and developed a classification
approach to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, using
prompt engineering to guide the model's output.

*Yiming Xu,Runzhi He,Hengzhi Ye,Minghui Zhou,Huaimin Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper tackles the risk of maintenance cessation in OSS projects by proposing a multi-perspective prediction tool, outperforming prior approaches in interpretability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address maintenance risks of OSS projects that threaten modern software supply chains.

Method: A multi-perspective feature framework combining user-centric, maintainer-centric, and project evolution features, applied on a large dataset of OSS repositories.

Result: Achieved high prediction accuracy (C-index 0.846) for maintenance cessation using advanced survival analysis and validated the framework via real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, interpretable, and effective methodology for predicting maintenance risks in OSS, enabling informed risk management.

Abstract: The maintenance risks of open source software (OSS) projects pose significant
threats to the quality, security, and resilience of modern software supply
chains. While prior research has proposed diverse approaches for predicting OSS
maintenance risk -- leveraging signals ranging from surface features (e.g.,
stars, commits) to social network analyses and behavioral patterns -- existing
methods often suffer from ambiguous operational definitions, limited
interpretability, and datasets of insufficient scale or generalizability. In
this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit
archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation.
Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of
115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events
-- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We
propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting
maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features,
maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival
analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming
models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis
further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying a GBSA classifier
in the openEuler ecosystem for proactive package risk screening. Our work
establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk
prediction, enabling reproducible risk management across large-scale open
source ecosystems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents MultiAIGCD, a dataset for detecting AI-generated code across Python, Java, and Go, containing over 150,000 code snippets, both AI-generated and human-authored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges AI-generated code poses in education and professional contexts by developing reliable detection methods.

Method: The authors gathered code samples via CodeNet problem definitions and six LLMs, simulating various scenarios (code generation, error fixing, output correction), and built a large dataset.

Result: The dataset, containing 121,271 AI-generated and 32,148 human-written snippets, was used to benchmark AI-generated code detection models across different scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable dataset and benchmarks for advancing AI-generated code detection, emphasizing the fairness and integrity in its applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

*Christian Meske,Tobias Hermanns,Esther von der Weiden,Kai-Uwe Loser,Thorsten Berger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores "vibe coding," where humans and AI collaborate in natural language dialogue to create software, examining its impact on cognitive work, expertise distribution, opportunities, and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the disconnect between the rapid adoption of AI-generated codebases and the limited understanding of the "vibe coding" paradigm in software development.

Method: The authors use an intent perspective and historical analysis to define vibe coding, analyzing how it reshapes the process of intent mediation and redistributes cognitive and epistemic labor.

Result: Vibe coding redistributes software development expertise from design and technical implementation to collaborative orchestration, presenting opportunities (e.g., democratization, acceleration) and risks (e.g., black box codebases, responsibility gaps).

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a research agenda focusing on human-, technology-, and organization-centered studies to investigate the full implications of vibe coding on the software development paradigm.

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

### [334] [DeepGo: Predictive Directed Greybox Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21952)
*Peihong Lin,Pengfei Wang,Xu Zhou,Wei Xie,Gen Zhang,Kai Lu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DeepGo introduces a predictive directed grey-box fuzzing technique that combines historical data with predictions to optimally reach target sites through high-reward paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing (DGF) methods rely heavily on heuristic algorithms based on historical data, which lack the ability to predict and explore hard-to-execute paths efficiently, leading to limitations in targets with complex constraints.

Method: DeepGo models DGF as path transitions through sequences, uses neural networks to create a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE) to predict rewards of unexplored paths, employs Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) for optimal path generation, and optimizes fuzzing via an action group.

Result: The proposed DeepGo approach effectively combines predictive and historical data to generate optimal paths, guiding fuzzing mutations and improving efficiency in reaching target sites.

Conclusion: DeepGo provides an innovative framework for enhancing DGF by leveraging predictive models and reinforcement learning, overcoming the limitations of traditional heuristic-based methods and increasing the efficiency of fuzzing processes for complex paths.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

### [335] [Fine-Tuning Code Language Models to Detect Cross-Language Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21954)
*Zengyang Li,Yimeng Li,Binbin Huang,Peng Liang,Ran Mo,Hui Liu,Yutao Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of pre-trained code language models (CodeLMs) for detecting cross-language bugs (CLBs) caused by interactions between different programming languages, using a specially constructed CLB dataset. Fine-tuning CodeLMs showed significant performance improvement, with smaller models often outperforming larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of detecting cross-language bugs (CLBs), an issue not adequately handled by single-language bug detection tools. This arises from the increasing prevalence of multilingual programming in software projects.

Method: The authors developed a tool called CLCFinder to identify cross-language code and created a dataset involving three programming language combinations and nine interaction types. They fine-tuned 13 pre-trained CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their performance based on various factors like dataset size, token sequence length, and code comments.

Result: After fine-tuning, all models showed varying levels of performance improvement, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Smaller fine-tuned CodeLMs often outperformed larger ones. Models trained on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLBs, and dataset size significantly affected performance, while longer token sequences and code comments had mixed impacts.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning pre-trained CodeLMs is effective for detecting CLBs, with smaller models benefiting more consistently. The findings highlight the differences between detecting CLBs and single-language bugs, emphasizing the importance of dedicated cross-language datasets and tailored fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

*Mingxuan Gao,Jingjing Chen,Yun Long,Xiaomeng Xu,Yu Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study examines classroom silence using physiological data and proposes a framework to classify silent behaviors, shedding light on their nuanced impact on learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional views of classroom silence often regard it as passive and unproductive, but its complexity and potential impact on learning remain underexplored.

Method: Researchers studied 54 middle school students during math lessons, employing EEG, electrodermal activity, heart rate measurements, and video coding to map physiological and behavioral markers of silence.

Result: High-achieving students exhibited distinct neurophysiological patterns during different types of silence, indicating varying levels of engagement. Differences in heart rates, EDA, and EEG signals revealed heterogeneity across achievement groups.

Conclusion: The paper redefines silence as a multifaceted phenomenon and introduces a framework to better understand its active role in learning, offering new insights into classroom dynamics.

Abstract: Background: Silence is a common phenomenon in classrooms, yet its implicit
nature limits a clear understanding of students' underlying learning statuses.
Aim: This study proposed a nuanced framework to classify classroom silence
based on class events and student status, and examined neurophysiological
markers to reveal similarities and differences in silent states across
achievement groups. Sample: The study involved 54 middle school students during
34 math lessons, with simultaneous recordings of electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrodermal activity (EDA), and heart rate signals, alongside video coding of
classroom behaviors. Results: We found that high-achieving students showed no
significant difference in mean EDA features between strategic silence (i.e.,
students choose silence deliberately) and active speaking during open
questioning but exhibited higher EEG high-frequency relative power spectral
density (RPSD) during strategic silence. In structural silence (i.e., students
maintain silence following an external command) during directed questioning,
they demonstrated significantly higher heart rates while listening to lectures
compared to group activities, indicating heightened engagement. Both high- and
medium-achieving students displayed elevated heart rates and EDA tonic
components in structural silence during questioning compared to teaching.
Furthermore, high-achieving students exhibited lower high-frequency RPSD during
structural silence than strategic silence, a pattern not observed in other
groups, highlighting group heterogeneity. Conclusions: The findings contribute
to validating the complexity of silence, challenge its traditional association
with passivity, and offer a novel classification framework along with
preliminary empirical evidence to deepen the understanding of silent learning
behaviors in classroom contexts.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study demonstrates gender similarities in neural mechanisms of mathematical cognition using fMRI and wavelet time-frequency analysis, challenging claims of inherent differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of direct neural evidence supporting gender differences in early mathematical performance, as well as limitations imposed by cultural contexts.

Method: The study employed functional MRI combined with advanced wavelet time-frequency analysis on 156 Japanese participants to examine dynamic brain processes during mathematical tasks. Additional machine learning classification was used to analyze gender-based differences.

Result: The neural dynamics underlying mathematical cognition showed 89.1% similarity between genders, with group differences overshadowed by individual variability at a ratio of 3.2:1. Machine learning classifiers were unable to distinguish gender from brain patterns, achieving only chance-level accuracy (53.8%).

Conclusion: Dynamic brain analysis reveals that gender similarities dominate the neural basis of mathematical cognition, challenging claims of inherent gender differences and highlighting the limitations of static behavioral studies.

Abstract: Recent large scale behavioral studies suggest early emergence of gender
differences in mathematical performance within months of school entry. However,
these findings lack direct neural evidence and are constrained by cultural
contexts. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during
mathematical tasks in Japanese participants (N = 156), employing an advanced
wavelet time frequency analysis to examine dynamic brain processes rather than
static activation patterns. Wavelet decomposition across four frequency bands
(0.01-0.25 Hz) revealed that neural processing mechanisms underlying
mathematical cognition are fundamentally similar between genders. Time
frequency analysis demonstrated 89.1% similarity in dynamic activation patterns
(p = 0.734, d = 0.05), with identical temporal sequences and frequency profiles
during mathematical processing. Individual variation in neural dynamics
exceeded group differences by 3.2:1 (p $<$ 0.001). Machine learning classifiers
achieved only 53.8% accuracy in distinguishing gender based neural patterns
essentially at chance level even when analyzing sophisticated temporal spectral
features. Cross frequency coupling analysis revealed similar network
coordination patterns between genders, indicating shared fundamental cognitive
architecture. These findings provide robust process level neural evidence that
gender similarities dominate mathematical cognition, particularly in early
developmental stages, challenging recent claims of inherent differences and
demonstrating that dynamic brain analysis reveals neural mechanisms that static
behavioral assessments cannot access.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the connection between vision and language representations in humans, finding that similarity judgments align in both modalities, and are explained by shared semantic spaces, including LLM embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how vision and language share representational structures in humans, driven by the emerging evidence of LLM-based semantic spaces predicting brain responses.

Method: The study involved 63 participants making behavioral similarity judgments on visual and linguistic stimuli (natural scene images and sentence captions), alongside fMRI data analysis and computational modeling involving LLM embeddings.

Result: Findings showed convergence in visual and linguistic similarity judgments, with fMRI brain responses aligning to both modalities. Computational models using LLM embeddings outperformed category-trained and AlexNet models in explaining similarity structures.

Conclusion: Human visual and linguistic similarity judgments stem from a shared, modality-independent representational structure. This reflects stable properties of the external world and mirrors mechanisms in sensory and artificial systems.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared
representational format between vision and language remains a significant
challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both
vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from
large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems
converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,
embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a
space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three
participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100
natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural
Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not
only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar
network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.
Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings
outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the
behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual
and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared,
modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system
encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems
suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as
arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured
representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external
world.

### [339] [Graph neural networks for residential location choice: connection to classical logit models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21334)
*Zhanhong Cheng,Lingqian Hu,Yuheng Bu,Yuqi Zhou,Shenhao Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper adapts Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model residential location choices under discrete choice analysis, improving spatial relationship modeling and predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for discrete choice analysis fail to explicitly capture relationships among choice alternatives, a key focus in traditional models.

Method: The paper proposes GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs), integrating GNNs with classical random utility theory to model dependence among spatial alternatives.

Result: GNN-DCMs outperform traditional models like MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices and offer better interpretability for capturing individual and spatial heterogeneity.

Conclusion: GNN-DCMs provide a unified framework that combines the strengths of discrete choice modeling and deep learning, particularly in spatial contexts, offering both higher predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis
as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive
performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly
capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a
long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap,
this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to
analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models
(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture
dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to
classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the
GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated
logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic
interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.
Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural
networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77
community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture
individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.
Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and
expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning
in the complex spatial choice contexts.

### [340] [From Sublinear to Linear: Fast Convergence in Deep Networks via Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21429)
*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explains why gradient descent (GD) in deep learning often converges exponentially quickly, despite non-convexity, by connecting Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability to local linear convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address the discrepancy between the theoretical sublinear convergence rate of gradient descent in non-convex loss landscapes and the observed exponential convergence rates in practice.

Method: The researchers establish the concept of Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Regions (LPLRs) and prove that neural networks initialized properly under NTK stability satisfy conditions leading to linear convergence in these regions. They validate their theoretical insights through experiments on neural networks of varying architectures.

Result: The study shows that LPLRs exist consistently across different neural network architectures and optimization settings, and GD achieves linear convergence within these regions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for the efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning, linking local geometry and optimization dynamics through the NTK framework.

Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of
deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While
recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a
sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to
explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In
this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption
on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally
Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds
the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks
admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear
convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that
matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse
settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern
ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR
structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously
connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK
framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the
remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.

### [341] [Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434)
*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a diagnostic tool for assessing sample dependence structures in scalable MCMC algorithms, addressing limitations of existing methods in the era of approximate inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diagnostic gap in biased MCMC algorithms, which sacrifice exact sampling for speed, by creating a method that evaluates the dependence structure of samples, often the primary focus in multivariate contexts.

Method: The Copula Discrepancy (CD) leverages Sklar's theorem to separate dependence structure from marginal distributions and introduces moment-based and MLE-based variants for computational efficiency and robust detection of tail dependencies.

Result: CD outperforms traditional diagnostics like effective sample size in tasks such as hyperparameter selection for biased MCMC and accurately detects subtle mismatches in tail dependence that other approaches miss.

Conclusion: CD is a rigorous, computationally efficient diagnostic tool that enhances practical and theoretical understanding for assessing sample quality, especially in the context of approximate Bayesian inference using biased MCMC.

Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern
Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a
critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail
catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based
diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct
assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in
multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled
and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to
isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure
independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first
structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate
inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically
outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter
selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where
traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect
subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank
correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical
Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With
computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein
discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC
practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of
structure-aware sample quality assessment.

### [342] [From Global to Local: A Scalable Benchmark for Local Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21449)
*Rohan Hitchcock,Jesse Hoogland*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper examines how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms interact with the degeneracy of loss landscapes in neural networks, proposing a novel scalable benchmark for local sampling performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding how SGMCMC algorithms operate in degenerate loss landscapes, given that current global convergence guarantees are inadequate or incompatible.

Method: A new scalable benchmark to test SGMCMC algorithms' local sampling performance is introduced and various algorithms, including RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD, are evaluated empirically.

Result: The evaluation highlights that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is effective in representing the local geometry of posterior distributions, even in large-scale models.

Conclusion: Though global theoretical guarantees are lacking, the study demonstrates the feasibility of extracting valuable local posterior information for models with 100M parameters.

Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks,
but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms
interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence
guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely
incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this
gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as
a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local
sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common
algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at
faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution.
Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our
empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local
information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.

TL;DR: This study presents a stochastic differential equation model and a novel deep learning method for analyzing forest transition dynamics and predicting future deforestation trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the complex dynamics of forest transitions, including shifts between forest, agricultural, and abandoned lands, and provide tools for predicting future trends.

Method: A stochastic differential equation model was developed along with a novel deep learning approach that estimates model parameters using time-series observations of land proportions.

Result: Global positive solutions were established for the model, and numerical analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of parameters on deforestation incentives.

Conclusion: The developed methods enable a better understanding and prediction of forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends, addressing challenges in parameter estimation with an innovative approach.

Abstract: Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest,
agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed
a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of
these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions
for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model
parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter
estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model
parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest
and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to
understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future
time.

*Urban Eriksson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real line into $N+1$ equal-probability segments, enabling discrete entropy and yielding insights into non-parametric inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine what inferences about a continuous probability distribution can be drawn from a finite sample, focusing on foundational and distribution-independent principles.

Method: The paper employs order statistics to establish that sorted sample points divide the real line into $N+1$ segments, each with equal expected probability mass.

Result: The primary finding is that this segmentation results in a discrete entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, applicable regardless of the distribution's shape.

Conclusion: The equal-probability partition can be used for robust non-parametric inference, offering an alternative to ECDF and improvements in density and tail estimation.

Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous
probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from
it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real
line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly
$1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental
properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying
distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete
entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the
sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare
this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its
implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and
tail estimation.

### [345] [MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21807)
*Robert Kuchen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIBoost, a unified variable-selection algorithm for imputed datasets, addressing challenges in missing data during statistical model building.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges and inefficiencies in model selection strategies caused by missing data, and improve prediction performance across multiple imputed datasets.

Method: The authors propose MIBoost, a modified component-wise gradient boosting algorithm with a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate that MIBoost achieves prediction performance comparable with recently proposed unified loss function methods for LASSO and elastic nets.

Conclusion: MIBoost offers a practical and effective solution to handle variable selection in the presence of missing data, providing a unified approach across imputed datasets.

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO,
elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for
building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often
complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address
missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets.
However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the
presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling
models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although
more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and
therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the
regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss
function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our
key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise
gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a
uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation
studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to
that of these recently proposed methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sync-TVA, a graph-attention framework for multimodal emotion recognition, tackling limitations like restricted cross-modal interaction and imbalanced modality contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal emotion recognition by overcoming issues of limited cross-modal interaction and modality imbalance for emotionally intelligent systems.

Method: The proposed Sync-TVA framework uses modality-specific dynamic enhancement modules, heterogeneous cross-modal graphs, and a cross-attention fusion mechanism for robust emotion inference.

Result: Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets show accuracy and weighted F1 score improvements over existing state-of-the-art models, especially in class-imbalanced scenarios.

Conclusion: Sync-TVA enhances performance in multimodal emotion recognition, offering a promising solution for robust and balanced emotion inference using graph-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally
intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However,
existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced
contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA,
an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic
enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a
dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous
cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual
features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for
robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and
weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven framework for automatically generating data contracts using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), showing significant reduction in manual effort and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contracts are essential to ensure consistency and reliability in data pipelines, but manual creation and maintenance are error-prone and labor-intensive, especially as pipelines grow in complexity.

Method: The authors fine-tuned LLMs using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and PEFT to generate data contract definitions (e.g., JSON Schema, Avro) from sample data or schema descriptions. They integrated this framework into platforms like Databricks and Snowflake.

Result: The fine-tuned LLMs significantly reduced manual effort by over 70% and achieved high accuracy in generating valid data contracts, based on tests with synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Generative AI, when fine-tuned for this purpose, can greatly enhance data governance by automating and scaling the generation of data contracts, though challenges like hallucination and continuous learning remain.

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow
in complexity, manual authoring and maintenance of contracts becomes
error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

*Georges Sfeir,Gabriel Nova,Stephane Hess,Sander van Cranenburgh*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper examines the role of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude in aiding Multinomial Logit (MNL) model specification and estimation under varied experimental setups. LLMs proved promising for model specification, though challenges persist, especially for open-weight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs as tools to assist in the development and estimation of Multinomial Logit (MNL) models, an area that is relatively underexplored.

Method: The study evaluated 13 versions of 6 leading LLMs across five experimental setups with variations in modeling goals, prompting strategies, and data access. LLM-suggested models were tested for goodness-of-fit, behavioral plausibility, and complexity.

Result: Proprietary LLMs like Claude and GPT excelled in generating valid MNL specifications, with Claude 4 Sonnet producing complex models and GPT achieving robust outcomes. Open-weight models like Llama struggled. Restricting raw data access sometimes improved reasoning. GPT o3 uniquely estimated its own model specifications.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant potential to aid choice modelers, particularly in model specification and estimation. Despite current limitations, they offer valuable guidance and demonstrate promise for future application in choice modeling workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows
across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains
relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive
agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of
Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework
involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.
These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting
vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.
Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data
dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,
and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and
model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and
behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by
structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to
produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the
best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with
robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided
with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance
internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of
correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.
Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of
LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification
but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide
practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in leveraging VQA's potential for advancing medical diagnostic systems, particularly to address the poor performance of general-domain models in specialized fields like medical imaging.

Method: The authors explore the adaptation of the Florence2 model to address specialized VQA tasks in GI endoscopy images and assess its effectiveness using metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR.

Result: While specific results aren't detailed in the abstract, the study demonstrates a methodological approach to enhancing medical imaging VQA using the Florence2 framework.

Conclusion: Adapting general-purpose models like Florence2 can bridge the gap for specialized domain applications in medical diagnostics, aiding more accurate and efficient disease diagnosis in GI imaging systems.

Abstract: VQA (Visual Question Answering) combines Natural Language Processing (NLP)
with image understanding to answer questions about a given image. It has
enormous potential for the development of medical diagnostic AI systems. Such a
system can help clinicians diagnose gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accurately

excellent VQA capabilities in the general domain, they perform very poorly for
VQA tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging. This study is a

*Jiahe Qian,Yaoyu Fang,Xinkun Wang,Lee A. Cooper,Bo Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective framework called ST-DAI for generating fully sampled 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST) using limited data from sparsely sampled sections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D ST rely on high-cost full sampling or external datasets, which are expensive and face generalization issues due to domain discrepancies.

Method: ST-DAI combines a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation, incorporating alignment, pseudo-supervision generation, refinement through domain-adaptive layers, and confidence-based label weighting.

Result: ST-DAI achieves comparable gene expression prediction accuracy to fully sampled methods while significantly reducing experimental costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, high-accuracy prediction in 3D spatial transcriptomics, addressing key challenges of domain discrepancy and sampling limitations.

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of
fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although
recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods
require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from
substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new
samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST
that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample
domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D
sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while
other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing
volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we
propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate
fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only
sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain
discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that
first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates
dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast
Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the
adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of
Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a
Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their
estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression
prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while
substantially reducing the measurement burden.

*Julia Wolleb,Florentin Bieder,Paul Friedrich,Hemant D. Tagare,Xenophon Papademetris*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VidFuncta, an implicit neural representation framework for ultrasound video analysis, addressing challenges in operator biases and non-standardized acquisitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deep learning struggles with ultrasound video analysis due to non-standardized acquisition methods and operator bias, requiring new approaches for better temporal and dataset-level representation.

Method: VidFuncta introduces variable-length ultrasound videos encoded into compact time-resolved representations by combining static and time-dependent modulation vectors, using the Functa framework.

Result: VidFuncta surpasses 2D and 3D baselines in video reconstruction, and it performs well on downstream tasks like ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast lesion classification using three public datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that VidFuncta provides a generalizable, compact, and effective representation for ultrasound videos, making it suitable for various downstream medical tasks.

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning
methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized
acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video
analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an
INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that
conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal
domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose
VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length
ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta
disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of
time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and
dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video
reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study introduces Cyst-X, an AI framework leveraging multicenter MRI data to improve early detection of malignancies in IPMN, a precursor to pancreatic cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing mortality rate of pancreatic cancer and the limitations of current guidelines in accurately assessing IPMN malignancy.

Method: The study developed and trained an AI model using MRI datasets from 764 patients across seven institutions. The framework used federated learning to preserve patient privacy.

Result: Cyst-X achieved an AUC score of 0.82, outperforming Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists, validating its prediction accuracy and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the potential of AI-driven solutions in improving patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer detection while simultaneously ensuring privacy through federated learning.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in
Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early
detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to
pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often
leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an
AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data,
leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and
738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models
(AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert
radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers
and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong
performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training
without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and
improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first
large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have shown great potential in medical domains but remain underexplored in complex cardiovascular diagnostics, highlighting a need for specialized models to handle this complexity.

Method: Cardiac-CLIP utilizes a two-stage pre-training strategy: a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) for self-supervised learning on volumetric data, and contrastive learning to align visual and textual data. It leverages a large dataset of real and public CT scans and standardizes radiology reports for pathology vector generation.

Result: Cardiac-CLIP sets new benchmarks in cardiovascular tasks, particularly excelling in predicting acute coronary syndrome, showcasing superior performance in both internal and external datasets.

Conclusion: Cardiac-CLIP demonstrates the effectiveness of foundation models tailored for medical imaging, contributing to better diagnostic support for complex cardiovascular conditions.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain.
However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation
model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a
two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked
autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture
rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive
learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,
facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect
16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.
Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates
and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based
on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive
learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the
effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12
independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the
evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated
across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,
information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP
exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the
prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously
difficult in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to bridge the gap in medical AI by connecting descriptive free-text radiology findings to their spatial locations in 3D chest CT scans.

Method: Using GPT-4 to extract findings, followed by manual segmentation by expert annotators and quality control by board-certified radiologists.

Result: The dataset contains 3,142 CT scans and 8,028 findings with comprehensive annotations, categorized into focal (79%) and non-focal (21%) abnormalities.

Conclusion: ReXGroundingCT offers a critical resource for advancing sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models, serving as a new benchmark for AI development in radiology.

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at

*Teng,Ma,Sile Yin,Li-Chia Yang,Shuo Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system that enhances on-screen target speaker audio while suppressing interference and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve challenges in speech enhancement caused by interfering speakers and background noise, especially in audio-only setups.

Method: RAVEN combines visual embeddings from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) to improve speech enhancement in varying signal-to-noise conditions.

Result: The system shows the best results with combined embeddings in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments and optimal performance with AVSR embeddings alone in noise-only scenarios.

Conclusion: RAVEN is the first open-source, real-time system for audio-visual speech enhancement and can run efficiently on standard CPU hardware.

Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly
in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet
effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which
isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing
interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings
learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker
detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers
of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR
and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker
environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios.
In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a
computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our
knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE
system.

TL;DR: DeepFDM integrates finite-difference with neural networks for learning parametric PDEs efficiently and interpretablely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of learning coefficients for time-dependent PDEs using a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach.

Method: DeepFDM embeds forward-Euler discretization into a convolutional NN architecture, enforcing stability via CFL-compliant parameterization and directly mapping model weights to PDE coefficients.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements on benchmark PDEs compared to state-of-the-art methods, with fewer parameters and reduced training epochs.

Conclusion: DeepFDM provides a transparent and efficient framework for data-driven solving and coefficient identification in parametric PDEs.

Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning
spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a
convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order
convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights
correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable
inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar
PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and
inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger
distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared
errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators,
U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer
parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match
ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust,
efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification
of parametric PDEs.

TL;DR: Energy system optimization models are growing more complex, necessitating advanced parallelization strategies. This review classifies these models, examines parallel decomposition methods, and suggests benchmarks and tools for better standardization and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity in energy system optimization due to renewable energy integration and sector coupling demands advanced computational solutions.

Method: The study proposes a classification scheme for these models, reviews various parallel decomposition methods, surveys software tools, and suggests benchmark criteria and reporting standards.

Result: No single parallelization approach emerges as universally superior, and there is a need for standardized benchmarks and reporting standards to facilitate meaningful comparison.

Conclusion: Insights from this review contribute to advancing parallelization strategies in energy systems modeling while also benefitting operations research.

Abstract: As renewable energy integration, sector coupling, and spatiotemporal detail
increase, energy system optimization models grow in size and complexity, often
pushing solvers to their performance limits. This systematic review explores
parallelization strategies that can address these challenges. We first propose
a classification scheme for linear energy system optimization models, covering
their analytical focus, mathematical structure, and scope. We then review
parallel decomposition methods, finding that while many offer performance
benefits, no single approach is universally superior. The lack of standardized
benchmark suites further complicates comparison. To address this, we recommend
essential criteria for future benchmarks and minimum reporting standards. We
also survey available software tools for parallel decomposition, including
modular frameworks and algorithmic abstractions. Though centered on energy
system models, our insights extend to the broader operations research field.

*Saeed Rahmani,Simeon C. Calvert,Bart van Arem*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for modeling trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control in mixed-autonomy traffic at urban junctions, addressing limitations of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to model non-cooperative interactions and realistic vehicle dynamics in mixed-autonomy traffic settings, particularly at complex urban junctions.

Method: The framework uses a bi-level approach: the upper level generates feasible trajectories with a graph search algorithm, while the lower level employs predictive control for tracking and optimization, without requiring centralized coordination or predefined paths.

Result: Numerical and simulation experiments confirm the framework's ability to model accurate, realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at diverse urban junctions, accommodating stochastic and operational elements.

Conclusion: The decentralized structure ensures realism and safety analysis suitability, facilitating insights into traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort in mixed-autonomy urban traffic.

Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic
is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially
important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur.
Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban
junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and
vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies
either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central
controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy
traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling
framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban
junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level
generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient
graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level
employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization.
Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central
controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are
explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are
used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of
traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's
decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such
as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay,
making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation
experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in
modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various
urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.

*Shoju Enami,Kenji Kashima*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the link between the temperature parameter and policy stochasticity in mutual information optimal control for discrete-time linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter and policy stochasticity, which remains unexplored in mutual information optimal control.

Method: The study extends previous results, establishes the existence of an optimal policy, and derives conditions on the temperature parameter for policy behavior under different scenarios. Validation is conducted through numerical experiments.

Result: The authors provide theoretical and algorithmic conditions connecting the temperature parameter to the stochastic or deterministic nature of policies.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of mutual information optimal control and its practical implications for policy design.

Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an
extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce
regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to
theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e.,
the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the
policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains
unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate
this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of
discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of
the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and
then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which
the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also
derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the
policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and
deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improved gain spectrum prediction for Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) using a novel Semi-Supervised Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) along with a two-phase training strategy and transfer learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing optical network performance, especially in multi-vendor solutions, requires accurate gain spectrum modeling for EDFAs.

Method: The paper proposes a SS-NN model leveraging EDFA features. It includes a two-phase training strategy (unsupervised pre-training & supervised fine-tuning), integrates transfer learning for different types of EDFAs, and addresses feature mismatches using covariance matching loss.

Result: The proposed approach significantly reduces measurement requirements and achieves lower mean absolute errors and better error distributions compared to benchmarks, demonstrated via experiments on multiple EDFAs.

Conclusion: The method improves gain spectrum prediction accuracy in EDFAs and minimizes measurement demands, providing a robust solution for evolving optical networks.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

*Wei Mao,Lili Wei,Omid Semiari,Shu-ping Yeh,Hosein Nikopour*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize the balance between energy saving and packet delay in 5G networks, achieving significant energy efficiency while maintaining minimal QoS degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenge of balancing energy saving and packet delay in 5G networks using cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX).

Method: The paper utilizes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit model, coupled with a smooth reward function, to train an AI agent for optimal cell DTX/DRX configuration.

Result: The proposed AI agent achieves up to ~45% energy savings while maintaining less than ~1% quality of service (QoS) degradation across different traffic load scenarios.

Conclusion: Through the DRL framework, the paper effectively demonstrates an optimal solution for energy saving in 5G networks without significant QoS compromise.

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Super Mario Maker 2 user-created levels to examine factors influencing difficulty, using regression models and NLP techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what factors affect the difficulty of SMM2 user-designed levels and promote insights into user level design.

Method: Two primary analyses: regression modeling to identify correlations between difficulty and level features, and natural language processing techniques to extract insights from user-supplied data.

Result: Key correlations found between level characteristics (style, popularity, timing) and difficulty, along with associations between difficulty and specific topics or sentiments.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into differences in level difficulties, contributing to understanding end-user design in SMM2.

Abstract: Games like Super Mario Maker 2 (SMM2) lower the barrier for casual users to
become level designers. In this paper, we set out to analyze a vast amount of
data about SMM2 user-written levels, in order to understand what factors affect
a level's difficulty as experienced by other users. To this end, we perform two
kinds of analyses: one based on regression models and one using natural
language processing techniques. The main results shed light on which level
characteristics (e.g., its style, popularity, timing) and which topics and
sentiments have a consistent association with easier or harder levels. While
none of our findings are startling, they help distill some key differences
between easy and hard SMM2 levels, which, in turn, can pave the way for a
better understanding of end-user level design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research lacks detailed, context-specific AR design recommendations for the User-Centered Design (UCD) process, especially for AR applications in Corporate Training (CT).

Method: The study extends a dataset of Mixed Reality design recommendations, incorporates AR-specific recommendations since 2020, employs NLP via Sentence Transformer for classification, and evaluates the relevance using expert inputs.

Result: An expanded dataset of 597 design recommendations classified into 84 topics is compiled. Specifically for AR in CT, 32 topics containing 284 statements are identified as relevant.

Conclusion: These findings provide a valuable resource for improving AR design in CT scenarios and contribute to enhancing AR-specific User Experience measurement strategies.

Abstract: Innovative technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), introduce new
interaction paradigms, demanding the identification of software requirements
during the software development process. In general, design recommendations are
related to this, supporting the design of applications positively and meeting
stakeholder needs. However, current research lacks context-specific AR design
recommendations. This study addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing
practical AR design recommendations relevant to the evaluation phase of the
User-Centered Design (UCD) process. We rely on an existing dataset of Mixed
Reality (MR) design recommendations. We applied a multi-method approach by (1)
extending the dataset with AR-specific recommendations published since 2020,
(2) classifying the identified recommendations using a NLP classification
approach based on a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, (3) summarizing the
content of all topics, and (4) evaluating their relevance concerning AR in
Corporate Training (CT) both based on a qualitative Round Robin approach with
five experts. As a result, an updated dataset of 597 practitioner design
recommendations, classified into 84 topics, is provided with new insights into
their applicability in the context of AR in CT. Based on this, 32 topics with a
total of 284 statements were evaluated as relevant for AR in CT. This research
directly contributes to the authors' work for extending their AR-specific User

improvement of AR applications for CT scenarios.

Abstract: Industrial assembly tasks increasingly demand rapid adaptation to complex
procedures and varied components, yet are often conducted in environments with
limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy requirements. These
constraints make conventional cloud-based or fully autonomous solutions
impractical for factory deployment. This paper introduces a mobile-device-based
assistant system for industrial training and operational support, enabling
real-time, semi-hands-free interaction through on-device perception and voice
interfaces. The system integrates lightweight object detection, speech
recognition, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a modular on-device
pipeline that operates entirely on-device, enabling intuitive support for part
handling and procedure understanding without relying on manual supervision or
cloud services. To enable scalable training, we adopt an automated data
construction pipeline and introduce a two-stage refinement strategy to improve
visual robustness under domain shift. Experiments on our generated dataset,
i.e., Gear8, demonstrate improved robustness to domain shift and common visual
corruptions. A structured user study further confirms its practical viability,
with positive user feedback on the clarity of the guidance and the quality of
the interaction. These results indicate that our framework offers a deployable
solution for real-time, privacy-preserving smart assistance in industrial
environments. We will release the Gear8 dataset and source code upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and induce trust in human relationships, particularly in trust-based interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI, especially LLMs, can support users in understanding and fostering trust in relationships, given the rise of electronic communication in human interactions.

Method: The study examines whether LLMs can reason about trust between two individuals and tests their ability to instill trust by taking on one role in a trust-based interaction and planning trust-building actions.

Result: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in understanding and fostering trust within the context of human interactions, although specific outcomes are not included in this abstract.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential to assist in understanding and nurturing trust in electronic human communication, providing insights into trust-building behaviors.

Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that
helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a
strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together
effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through
electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems
to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In
this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason
about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering
trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust
by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions
which can instil trust.

*Xiaotian Su,Naim Zierau,Soomin Kim,April Yi Wang,Thiemo Wambsganss*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study evaluates emotion monitoring dashboards aimed at reducing hate speech and improving digital interactions, revealing both benefits and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues with current moderation on social media, which often involves criticisms of censorship and fails to resolve uncivil behavior at its root.

Method: The authors designed two types of emotion monitoring dashboards and tested their effects on emotional awareness and commenting behavior in a study of 211 participants.

Result: The dashboards made users more aware of their emotions and reduced hate speech but also led to greater expression of negative emotions on sensitive topics.

Conclusion: Emotion monitoring tools can help mitigate hate speech but need optimization to handle unintended emotional responses effectively.

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VizGenie is a self-improving framework that uses large language models (LLMs) for scientific visualization, enabling dynamic module generation, natural language interaction, and iterative learning from user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address cognitive overhead and limitations in existing scientific visualization tools, making it easier for users to interactively explore complex datasets.

Method: VizGenie integrates LLMs for generating dynamic visualization scripts, incorporates domain-specific tools, uses fine-tuned vision models for natural language queries and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for reliable responses.

Result: Evaluations demonstrate reduced cognitive overhead and enhanced adaptability in handling complex volumetric data visualization tasks.

Conclusion: VizGenie successfully accelerates insight generation in scientific visualization while maintaining reproducibility and continuously evolving through user interaction.

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

*Qinglong Yang,Haoming Li,Haotian Zhao,Xiaokai Yan,Jingtao Ding,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FingerTip benchmark to improve mobile GUI agents through proactive task suggestions and personalized user experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents lack proactive intent anticipation and fail to consider individual user preferences during task execution.

Method: The paper develops FingerTip, a benchmark with tracks for proactive task suggestion and personalized task execution, supported by unique user demonstration data from real-life scenarios.

Result: Experiments show the model, fine-tuned on their dataset, successfully utilized user context and data to achieve effective task handling.

Conclusion: FingerTip demonstrates the viability of creating more user-focused mobile GUI agents and releases open-source tools for reproducibility.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device
interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'
previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action
preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android
device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are
not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in
their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information.
Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned
with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved
good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more
user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates how educators can integrate generative AI tools into courses, focusing on their pedagogical impact on qualitative research methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing gaps in the perception of students as passive AI users and the limited application of AI in qualitative methods education.

Method: The instructors employed the TPACK framework and action research methodology to design GPT tools that scaffolded various research-related tasks, analyzing their impact through student reflections, AI logs, and assignments.

Result: The tools enhanced student reflexivity and structured thinking but also raised concerns about cognitive overload, reduced immersion, and formulaic AI responses.

Conclusion: Educator-designed GPT tools, when aligned with pedagogy, can effectively support active and reflective learning, emphasizing the need for thoughtful integration of AI in education.

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

*Naba Rizvi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper highlights how AI marginalizes autistic individuals due to biased data representation and proposes 'Neuro-Inclusive AI' as a paradigm to improve inclusivity by moving away from mimicking human-like communication as the intelligence benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the marginalization of up to 75 million autistic people in AI applications due to biases in datasets and research that neglect their perspective.

Method: Analyzed origins and impacts of anti-autistic biases in AI. Conducted experiments using annotators and LLMs to evaluate labeling schemes for anti-autistic hate speech. Developed a benchmark called AUTALIC.

Result: 90% of human-like AI agents exclude autistic perspectives. Binary labeling schemes effectively captured nuances in anti-autistic hate speech. AUTALIC benchmark was created to evaluate or fine-tune AI models.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes promoting neuro-inclusive AI and offers AUTALIC as a tool to foster diversity, providing a foundation for future research and applications.

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

*Katherine M. Collins,Kartik Chandra,Adrian Weller,Jonathan Ragan-Kelley,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how emotional considerations influence explanations in social interactions, using a computational model focused on medical explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of emotion in the process of providing explanations within cooperative social interactions.

Method: Developed a computational framework to model explanations considering emotional impacts, and validated it with human intuition in medical scenarios.

Result: The emotion-aware model outperformed emotion-agnostic versions in mirroring human intuition about explanations.

Conclusion: Humans take emotion into account when giving explanations, and modeling this consideration improves our understanding of explanation behavior.

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

TL;DR: Interactive AI simulations improve conceptual understanding and literacy, essential for societal decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems influence both individual and societal decisions, necessitating critical AI literacy for informed engagement.

Method: A controlled study with 605 participants evaluating the use of interactive AI tutorials for learning key AI concepts.

Result: Interactive simulations significantly enhance AI literacy and confidence, although engagement alone doesn't ensure learning.

Conclusion: The study underlines the value of interactive, inquiry-driven approaches for fostering critical AI literacy effectively.

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can
better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ProMemAssist is a smart glasses system designed to provide context-aware assistance using real-time working memory modeling, showing promise in improving engagement and selective task assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wearable AI systems fail to adapt assistance timing to users' mental states, missing opportunities to improve task engagement without intrusive interruptions.

Method: The system uses a real-time working memory model informed by cognitive theories, employing encoding mechanisms like displacement and interference, alongside a timing predictor to optimize assistance delivery.

Result: In tests with 12 participants performing demanding tasks, ProMemAssist demonstrated more selective assistance and achieved higher engagement compared to a baseline LLM-based system.

Conclusion: Modeling working memory can enhance wearable AI systems by providing nuanced, timely, and context-sensitive support, with implications for developing more attentive and proactive user-aware agents.

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of AI literacy on students' experiences with AI tools in education is crucial to improve effectiveness.

Method: Examined relationships between AI literacy, usability, satisfaction, engagement, and learning effectiveness using data from 309 undergraduates. Structural equation modeling was applied.

Result: AI literacy predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement, leading to better perceived learning effectiveness. Prior AI exposure had no significant impact.

Conclusion: AI literacy significantly enhances student experiences with AI tools. Adaptive, user-centered designs should align with varying literacy levels to optimize learning environments.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MapAgent, an LLM-based agent framework, enhances task planning on mobile GUIs using memory from historical trajectories. It outperforms existing methods by leveraging structured page-memory databases for informed planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents using LLMs struggle with executing complex real-world tasks on mobile GUIs due to limited understanding of applications, causing poor task planning and hallucinations.

Method: The authors developed MapAgent with a trajectory-based memory mechanism to construct a page-memory database, coarse-to-fine task planning to retrieve trajectory data, and dual-LLM architecture for task execution.

Result: Experimental results show that MapAgent significantly improves task performance compared to existing methods in real-world mobile scenarios.

Conclusion: MapAgent provides an effective solution for automating GUI tasks by augmenting LLMs with structured memory, paving the way for further research with open-source code.

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new algorithm, Preconditioned Discrete-HAMS (PDHAMS), for sampling discrete distributions, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and capabilities of gradient-based MCMC algorithms for sampling discrete distributions.

Method: The PDHAMS algorithm incorporates second-order quadratic approximation and Gaussian integral trick to enhance DHAMS, ensuring detailed balance and rejection-free properties.

Result: Numerical experiments show PDHAMS outperforms existing gradient-based MCMC methods in performance.

Conclusion: PDHAMS extends current MCMC techniques to offer reliable, irreversible, and efficient sampling for discrete distributions, particularly with quadratic potentials.

Abstract: Gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have recently received much
attention for sampling discrete distributions, with notable examples such as
Norm Constrained Gradient (NCG), Auxiliary Variable Gradient (AVG), and
Discrete Hamiltonian Assisted Metropolis Sampling (DHAMS). In this work, we
propose the Preconditioned Discrete-HAMS (PDHAMS) algorithm, which extends
DHAMS by incorporating a second-order, quadratic approximation of the potential
function, and uses Gaussian integral trick to avoid directly sampling a
pairwise Markov random field. The PDHAMS sampler not only satisfies generalized
detailed balance, hence enabling irreversible sampling, but also is a
rejection-free property for a target distribution with a quadratic potential
function. In various numerical experiments, PDHAMS algorithms consistently
yield superior performance compared with other methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian tree ensemble model for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in censored survival data, using a novel approach with horseshoe priors and reversible jump Gibbs sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address challenges in estimating treatment effects in high-dimensional censored survival data with adaptability and noise reduction.

Method: The approach uses a Bayesian tree ensemble model with horseshoe priors for adaptable shrinkage, implemented via a reversible jump Gibbs sampler.

Result: Simulations demonstrate accurate estimation of treatment effects across varying sparsity levels and non-linear functions. The method is validated with a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma survival data.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles high-dimensional censored survival data, providing accurate treatment effect estimation and showcasing practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian tree ensemble model to estimate heterogeneous treatment
effects in censored survival data with high-dimensional covariates. Instead of
imposing sparsity through the tree structure, we place a horseshoe prior
directly on the step heights to achieve adaptive global-local shrinkage. This
strategy allows flexible regularisation and reduces noise. We develop a
reversible jump Gibbs sampler to accommodate the non-conjugate horseshoe prior
within the tree ensemble framework. We show through extensive simulations that
the method accurately estimates treatment effects in high-dimensional covariate
spaces, at various sparsity levels, and under non-linear treatment effect
functions. We further illustrate the practical utility of the proposed approach
by a re-analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survival data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates outlier detection methods in longitudinal data, comparing traditional and modern approaches from data science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective outlier detection in panel survey data and compare traditional statistical methods with newer approaches from machine learning and data mining.

Method: Comparison of traditional outlier detection methods with modern techniques such as distance-based and tree-based methods using panel survey data.

Result: Modern methods, though dependent on parameter tuning, were found to be more flexible and occasionally more effective, especially in handling multidimensional data.

Conclusion: While traditional methods are simple and intuitive, modern techniques offer greater flexibility and versatility for differing data scenarios, particularly for multidimensional datasets.

Abstract: This note investigates the problem of detecting outliers in longitudinal
data. It compares well-known methods used in official statistics with proposals
from the fields of data mining and machine learning that are based on the
distance between observations or binary partitioning trees. This is achieved by
applying the methods to panel survey data related to different types of
statistical units. Traditional methods are quite simple, enabling the direct
identification of potential outliers, but they require specific assumptions. In
contrast, recent methods provide only a score whose magnitude is directly
related to the likelihood of an outlier being present. All the methods require
the user to set a number of tuning parameters. However, the most recent methods
are more flexible and sometimes more effective than traditional methods. In
addition, these methods can be applied to multidimensional data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of dynamical many-body systems, which are critical across various living and non-living self-assembled materials.

Method: The study employs topological data analysis with a novel descriptor ($\Psi$-function) to capture spatiotemporal changes and spatial organization. It also applies geometric analysis to vector fields derived from skyrmion images.

Result: The proposed methodology reveals insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response to external stimuli, validating its utility in bridging experimental data with theoretical frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a versatile tool for analyzing both individual patterns and overall system behavior, establishing connections between experimental observations and real-world processes in diverse disciplines.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by
analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising
method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems.
The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative
example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex
spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and
topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating
such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple
scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust
numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in
the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of
regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based
on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles
offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response
to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical
predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a
characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual
pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of
image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or
biological system in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI will truly improve physician-patient relationships as envisioned by Eric Topol.

Method: Analyzes factors that may counter Topol's optimistic projection on medical AI's role.

Result: Medical AI might degrade therapeutic relationships and compromise satisfaction for both doctors and patients.

Conclusion: AI in medicine could hinder the empathetic aspects of care instead of enhancing them.

Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the
development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic
shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he
suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks
of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate
advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking
its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention
to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately,
several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health
care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient
relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic
relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.

*Anass El Ayady,Maxime Devanne,Germain Forestier,Nour El Mawas*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of multivariate time series classification methods to predict learner performance in MOOCs, analyzing behavioral traces to identify at-risk learners and improve completion rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the low completion rates in MOOCs and the need for personalized content to engage learners and improve outcomes.

Method: The method involves applying multivariate time series classification techniques to predict learner performance based on behavioral data from the OULAD dataset across different times during a course.

Result: Preliminary findings demonstrate the potential of these approaches for predicting learner failure and emphasize the role of diverse and rich behavioral interactions in boosting prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that these methods can assist in identifying at-risk learners and offering personalized interventions to enhance learning outcomes in MOOCs.

Abstract: MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates
remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue,
it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored
feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time
series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time
series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages
of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted
on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three
courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the
evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The
analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of
recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse
behavioral data.

### [385] [Bridging the Gap: Enhancing News Interpretation Across Diverse Audiences with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21055)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using large AI models to identify audience comprehension gaps in news and improve their understanding through tailored supplemental materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: News comprehension often varies across audiences due to differences in expertise and age, highlighting a need to bridge the gap in understanding beyond individuals' primary domains of knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes an agent-based framework where large language models simulate discussions between agents representing diverse expertise or age groups to identify comprehension gaps in news.

Result: The framework effectively detects misunderstandings during agent discussions and provides supplementary materials that significantly enhance the agents' understanding of the news.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient in improving news comprehension by directly addressing understanding gaps across diverse audiences.

Abstract: In the interconnected world, news media are critical in conveying information
to public across diverse domains including technology, finance, and
agriculture. Journalists make efforts to present accurate information, however,
the interpretation of news often varies significantly among different audiences
due to their specific expertise and age. In this work, we investigate how to
identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences
understanding of news content, particular to the aspects of articles outside
their primary domains of knowledge. We propose a agent-based framework using
large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where
several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts
from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that
this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the
agent through the iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate
identification, the framework can design a supplement material specific to
these agents on the news. Our results show that agents exhibit significantly
improved news understanding after receiving this material. These findings
highlight our framework's utility and efficiency in enhancing news
comprehension for diverse audiences by directly addressing their understanding
gap.

*Lenart Motnikar,Katharina Baum,Alexander Kagan,Sarah Spiekermann-Hoff*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bottom-up approach to ethical value alignment for conversational agents using real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current top-down approaches to ethical value alignment for conversational agents often misalign with user expectations and fail to reflect specific operational contexts.

Method: The authors use the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard to analyze 16,908 conversational logs from a major European employment service CA, identifying 593 ethically sensitive system outputs.

Result: The analysis uncovered nine core values and 32 instances of value misalignment where the system's outputs negatively impacted users.

Conclusion: The proposed bottom-up framework offers actionable measures for creating context-sensitive, ethically aligned conversational agents.

Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) based on generative artificial intelligence
frequently face challenges ensuring ethical interactions that align with human
values. Current value alignment efforts largely rely on top-down approaches,
such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods
tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate,
potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing
the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT
design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from
16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to
identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world
interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value
misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable
insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve
more context-sensitive value alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve semantic understanding and threat detection in tactical video scenarios with high noise and weak structure.

Method: Combines spectral embedding, causal edge modeling, and discriminative path inference; builds temporal graphs using multimodal inputs like visual cues, acoustics, and actions.

Result: Achieves 89.3% accuracy in temporal alignment and 85% complete threat chain recognition, with minimal node latency.

Conclusion: The system enhances interpretability and supports advanced applications like surveillance and defense systems for intelligent threat detection.

Abstract: This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph
theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and
threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The
framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and
discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware
keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct
temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the
model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on
TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal
alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node
latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural
interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and
intelligent security systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of concrete and comprehensive ecological impact estimates for AI models and applications by developers.

Method: Proposes combining philosophical insights with practical analysis to examine the sustainability aspects of generative AI.

Result: Highlighted gaps in existing ecological analyses of AI products, urging for a multi-faceted and practical approach informed by philosophy.

Conclusion: Encourages developers and researchers to adopt sustainable AI practices by integrating philosophical principles and comprehensive analysis tools.

Abstract: Philosophers of technology have recently started paying more attention to the
environmental impacts of AI, in particular of large language models (LLMs) and
generative AI (genAI) applications. Meanwhile, few developers of AI give
concrete estimates of the ecological impact of their models and products, and
even when they do so, their analysis is often limited to green house gas
emissions of certain stages of AI development or use. The current proposal
encourages practically viable analyses of the sustainability aspects of genAI
informed by philosophical ideas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research on socio-technical challenges and trust factors in using AI within everyday work practices, particularly in safety-critical domains like air traffic control.

Method: The paper employs an ethnographic study approach to analyze how existing tools are used in air traffic control and extrapolates requirements for trustworthy AI.

Result: The findings reveal critical insights into how trust issues manifest in everyday work involving current tools, shaping the prerequisites for trustworthy AI in safety-critical settings.

Conclusion: Understanding the socio-technical dynamics and trust requirements is key to adopting reliable AI systems in air traffic control and similar domains.

Abstract: Exploring the socio-technical challenges confronting the adoption of AI in
organisational settings is something that has so far been largely absent from
the related literature. In particular, research into requirements for
trustworthy AI typically overlooks how people deal with the problems of trust
in the tools that they use as part of their everyday work practices. This
article presents some findings from an ongoing ethnographic study of how
current tools are used in air traffic control work and what it reveals about
requirements for trustworthy AI in air traffic control and other
safety-critical application domains.

*Leonard Dung,Max Hellrigel-Holderbaum*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper argues against the pursuit of AGI Racing due to its high risks, limited benefits, and suggests international cooperation as a safer alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising interest in AGI Racing among major actors, aiming to develop advanced AI systems ahead of competitors, raises questions about the risks and rewards of such an approach.

Method: The authors analyze the risks associated with AGI Racing, assess its potential benefits, and propose international cooperation and deterrence as alternatives.

Result: The study finds that AGI Racing increases catastrophic risks, questions the dominance promised by winning the race, and highlights the feasibility of safer cooperative alternatives.

Conclusion: Pursuing AGI Racing is counterproductive, and prioritizing international cooperation is more beneficial and less risky for all parties involved.

Abstract: AGI Racing is the view that it is in the self-interest of major actors in AI
development, especially powerful nations, to accelerate their frontier AI
development to build highly capable AI, especially artificial general
intelligence (AGI), before competitors have a chance. We argue against AGI
Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by
this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from
AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI
safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be
lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable
whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third,
international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted
deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have
much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to
AGI is supposed to provide. Hence, racing to AGI is not in anyone's
self-interest as other actions, particularly incentivizing and seeking
international cooperation around AI issues, are preferable.

*Malte Londschien,Manuel Burger,Gunnar R√§tsch,Peter B√ºhlmann*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This study enhances predictive models for clinical use across multiple hospital ICU datasets using causality-inspired domain generalization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how predictive models can maintain performance under distribution shifts in new hospitals' clinical settings.

Method: Apply anchor regression and propose anchor boosting on a dataset of 400,000 patients from nine ICU databases.

Result: Anchor regularization improves out-of-distribution performance, especially in highly dissimilar domains, even with violations of some theoretical assumptions.

Conclusion: Anchor-based methods are effective for clinical domain generalization, and external datasets' utility varies based on the availability of target-domain data.

Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when
deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a
large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous
multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and
introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large
dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The
anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance,
particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust
to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity.
Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of
large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of
available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain
generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a
domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and
(iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper focuses on developing machine learning models to predict vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), demonstrating the success of an MLP model using a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve prenatal counseling and reduce delivery-related risks by predicting VBAC outcomes accurately.

Method: Three classifiers, including logistic regression, XGBoost, and MLP, were trained on a dataset of 643,029 TOLAC cases using 47 prenatal features. Key predictors were identified, and techniques for addressing class imbalance were applied.

Result: The MLP achieved the highest AUC score (0.7287), surpassing XGBoost (0.727) and logistic regression (0.709), demonstrating moderate predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Routinely collected prenatal variables can support scalable VBAC prediction models, offering clinical utility, especially where specialized data is unavailable.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the outcome of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)
is essential for guiding prenatal counseling and minimizing delivery-related
risks. This study presents supervised machine learning models for predicting
vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using 643,029 TOLAC cases from the CDC
WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023). After filtering for singleton births with
one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period
features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a
multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an
AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the
logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class
weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in
XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and
precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted
maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as
key predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that routinely collected,
early-pregnancy variables can support scalable and moderately high-performing
VBAC prediction models. These models offer potential utility in clinical
decision support, particularly in settings lacking access to specialized
intrapartum data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms, which is crucial for precision medicine.

Method: The method includes three main innovations: cross-species pre-training on mammalian genomes, fine-tuning on ClinVar and HGMD for germline mutation specialization, and integration of interpretable clinical frameworks with DNA sequence embeddings and LLM-based explanations.

Result: EnTao-GPM showed superior accuracy in mutation classification when validated against ClinVar.

Conclusion: EnTao-GPM transforms genetic testing by providing faster, more accurate, and accessible interpretations for clinical diagnostics and research, advancing personalized medicine.

Abstract: Distinguishing pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms remains a
critical challenge in precision medicine. EnTao-GPM, developed by Fudan
University and BioMap, addresses this through three innovations: (1)
Cross-species targeted pre-training on disease-relevant mammalian genomes
(human, pig, mouse), leveraging evolutionary conservation to enhance
interpretation of pathogenic motifs, particularly in non-coding regions; (2)
Germline mutation specialization via fine-tuning on ClinVar and HGMD, improving
accuracy for both SNVs and non-SNVs; (3) Interpretable clinical framework
integrating DNA sequence embeddings with LLM-based statistical explanations to
provide actionable insights. Validated against ClinVar, EnTao-GPM demonstrates
superior accuracy in mutation classification. It revolutionizes genetic testing
by enabling faster, more accurate, and accessible interpretation for clinical
diagnostics (e.g., variant assessment, risk identification, personalized
treatment) and research, advancing personalized medicine.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses quantum computer threats to traditional cryptography by proposing quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cryptographic methods like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography are threatened by advancements in quantum computing, and even existing PQC algorithms may not suffice for specialized scenarios.

Method: The study proposes using QRNGs to strengthen PQC algorithms, designing six QRNGs and assessing them using NIST validation tests (SP 800-90B). Additionally, the proposed QRNG-based PQC systems are evaluated in terms of computation time and performance.

Result: The paper evaluates the statistical properties of six QRNG designs and demonstrates their computational effectiveness and performance improvements in QRNG-based ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA algorithms.

Conclusion: QRNG-based PQC algorithms are a promising enhancement to current quantum-resilient cryptographic systems, offering additional security and improved performance in preparing for quantum-era threats.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed
potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography.
In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the
Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based
Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital
Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to
resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in
certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study
proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These
algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve
as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital
signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along
with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the
statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests
for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed
(IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six
QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and
QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future
deployment of PQC systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper refutes the 'blockchain trilemma,' arguing that decentralization, security, and scalability are not inherently trade-offs in blockchain protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the validity of the 'blockchain trilemma' concept by highlighting its theoretical and empirical weaknesses.

Method: The study utilizes formal analysis, empirical evidence, and critiques of current methodologies and terminologies associated with the trilemma.

Result: Finds that the 'blockchain trilemma' rests on flawed assumptions, including semantic confusion and misuse of distributed systems theory. Proposes Bitcoin as a deterministic, evidentiary trust protocol to show scalability as an engineering feat rather than a trade-off.

Conclusion: The paper identifies systemic issues in blockchain academic discourse, offers formal evaluation criteria for future research, and shows that scalability can coexist with decentralization and security given rigorous engineering approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain
trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent
trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain
protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique
of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to security risks in ChatGPT's plugin system despite its growing popularity and wide-ranging applications.

Method: Analyzed the security of plugins available in the ChatGPT plugin shop to identify major vulnerabilities.

Result: Identified significant security vulnerabilities in ChatGPT's plugin system.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for enhanced regulation and provides recommendations to improve the ChatGPT plugin system's security.

Abstract: Plugin systems are a class of external programmes that provide users with a
wide range of functionality, and while they enhance the user experience, their
security is always a challenge. Especially due to the diversity and complexity
of developers, many plugin systems lack adequate regulation. As ChatGPT has
become a popular large-scale language modelling platform, its plugin system is
also gradually developing, and the open platform provides creators with the
opportunity to upload plugins covering a wide range of application scenarios.
However, current research and discussions mostly focus on the security issues
of the ChatGPT model itself, while ignoring the possible security risks posed
by the plugin system. This study aims to analyse the security of plugins in the
ChatGPT plugin shop, reveal its major security vulnerabilities, and propose
corresponding improvements.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper critiques current automated vulnerability detection datasets for issues like high label inaccuracy, duplication, and poor generalization. They present solutions in the form of a curated test dataset (BenchVul), a refined training dataset (TitanVul), and a vulnerability generation framework (RVG). These contributions significantly improve generalization and vulnerability detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of existing automated vulnerability detection systems, which suffer from inaccurate labels, duplication, and limited representation of critical vulnerabilities. This results in models that fail to generalize well and perform poorly on independent data.

Method: The authors introduce three key components: (1) BenchVul, a manually curated test dataset focusing on critical vulnerabilities; (2) TitanVul, a high-quality training dataset created by aggregating and validating data; (3) RVG, a framework that generates realistic, context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented CWE types.

Result: The solutions close the performance gap significantly. Models trained on TitanVul generalize better, showing a performance increase from 0.584 to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Adding RVG-generated data results in an additional 14.0% improvement in performance, reaching 0.874.

Conclusion: The paper addresses key issues in vulnerability detection datasets and demonstrates methodologies to close the generalization gap. These contributions improve model robustness and may enhance real-world applicability.

Abstract: Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet
its real-world impact remains limited. Current vulnerability datasets suffer
from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication,
and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant
"generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance
(measured on held-out data from same dataset for training) by exploiting
spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our
analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of
up to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming
random guessing.
  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we
introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25
Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset,
TitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and
applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework.
Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which
synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but
critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.
  Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the
generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing:
models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and PrimeVul, experience
performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.567 to 0.337).
Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with
model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to
0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated
data yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the safety, privacy, and ethical challenges posed by Large Language Models, necessitating adaptable solutions to protect users.

Method: The authors developed OneShield, a framework allowing the definition of risk factors, contextual safety policies, and mitigation strategies tailored for specific situations and customers.

Result: OneShield's implementation is described with a focus on scalability and practical usage statistics since its deployment.

Conclusion: OneShield is presented as a promising standalone solution to address the diverse risks posed by LLMs, emphasizing its adaptability based on customer-specific needs.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many
possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and
all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature
of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential
risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In
this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and
customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities
for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and
compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific
customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability
considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first
deployment.

*Abdullah Al Siam,Sadequzzaman Shohan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using a modified CNN for privacy-preserving medical diagnostics by analyzing encrypted images. The system ensures data security with minimal impact on AI inference accuracy and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in AI-driven medical diagnostics, where sensitive imaging data requires secure transfer, storage, and processing.

Method: The paper utilizes AES-CBC encryption combined with JPEG2000 compression and introduces a modified Masked-CNN capable of working with encrypted medical images from DICOM datasets.

Result: The encrypted inference model demonstrated near-equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared to unencrypted models, with only minor trade-offs in latency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances data privacy with clinical utility, providing a secure, practical, and scalable solution for AI-based diagnostics.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

### [401] [Generating Adversarial Point Clouds Using Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21163)
*Ruiyang Zhao,Bingbing Zhu,Chuxuan Tong,Xiaoyi Zhou,Xi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study introduces a black-box adversarial attack method on 3D point clouds using diffusion models to address safety concerns in critical applications without relying on internal model information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research highlights the vulnerabilities of point cloud classification models through adversarial attacks, which can pose safety risks in applications like autonomous vehicles. While white-box attacks are effective, they lack real-world applicability, and black-box attacks often fall short in performance.

Method: The paper proposes using a 3D diffusion model that guides a reverse diffusion process, leveraging compressed point cloud features as prior knowledge. By transforming category distributions, adversarial points are added to the clean point cloud examples without accessing the internal details of the target model.

Result: The proposed black-box attack method improves both the success rate and imperceptibility of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds, showcasing its efficacy in realistic security assessments.

Conclusion: The novel approach successfully demonstrates a more effective black-box adversarial attack strategy for 3D point clouds, enhancing applicability in real-world scenarios while addressing safety risks in critical systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

### [402] [FedBAP: Backdoor Defense via Benign Adversarial Perturbation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21177)
*Xinhai Yan,Libing Wu,Zhuangzhuang Zhang,Bingyi Liu,Lijuan Huo,Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedBAP, a method to defend against backdoor attacks in Federated Learning by creating and utilizing benign adversarial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Federated Learning defenses fail against backdoor attacks as they do not address the model's reliance on backdoor triggers, especially with a high proportion of malicious clients.

Method: FedBAP uses a perturbed trigger generation mechanism to match backdoor triggers in location and size. It applies benign adversarial perturbations to disrupt model reliance on these triggers and employs an adaptive scaling mechanism to adjust perturbation intensity.

Result: FedBAP significantly reduces attack success rates across three types of backdoor attacks, showing reductions of up to 97.6%. It also performs well against unknown backdoor attack methods.

Conclusion: FedBAP is an effective defense framework that mitigates backdoor attacks by reducing model reliance on triggers, demonstrating robust performance and enhancing security in Federated Learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates
outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.

### [403] [Interpretable Anomaly-Based DDoS Detection in AI-RAN with XAI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21193)
*Sotiris Chatzimiltis,Mohammad Shojafar,Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and explainable AI (XAI) for anomaly-based detection of DDoS attacks in 5G RAN systems, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in securing next-generation RANs like 5G/6G by leveraging LLMs and explainability to make intrusion detection interpretable and accessible to non-experts.

Method: The paper uses an LSTM-based model to detect malicious activity using key performance measures (KPMs) from E2 nodes in Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controllers, coupled with explainability tools like LIME and SHAP for interpreting predictions and LLMs for user-friendly insights.

Result: Real-world experimental results show that the framework achieves high detection accuracy, with an F1 score greater than 0.96, while providing interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves both security and transparency in 5G RAN environments, making intrusion detection accurate and accessible to non-experts using XAI and LLMs.

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future
RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable
anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental
results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high
detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and
interpretable outputs.

### [404] [Hot-Swap MarkBoard: An Efficient Black-box Watermarking Approach for Large-scale Model Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20650)
*Zhicheng Zhang,Peizhuo Lv,Mengke Wan,Jiang Fang,Diandian Guo,Yezeng Chen,Yinlong Liu,Wei Ma,Jiyan Sun,Liru Geng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hot-Swap MarkBoard, a watermarking method tailored for protecting intellectual property in locally deployed DL models, allowing user-specific watermark embedding without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increased deployment of Deep Learning models on end-user devices amplifies intellectual property risks due to easy redistribution and theft.

Method: Hot-Swap MarkBoard independently embeds multiple watermarks using a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation module, enabling quick customization without retraining, paired with parameter obfuscation to protect watermark integrity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method's efficiency and adaptability across diverse tasks and models, achieving 100% verification accuracy.

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard offers a robust, efficient, and versatile solution for watermarking locally deployed AI models, enhancing intellectual property protection while supporting various tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

*Naseem Khan,Tuan Nguyen,Amine Bermak,Issa Khalil*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reviews current deepfake detection methods, discussing their strengths, limitations (especially against adversarial attacks), and emphasizes the need for more robust systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rapid growth of generative AI and its implications for digital security, misinformation, and identity fraud due to the rise of deepfakes.

Method: It systematically reviews state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods, categorizing them into two paradigms: (1) detecting fully synthetic content and (2) identifying manipulated regions in authentic content. The authors also establish a curated GitHub repository for open-source implementations.

Result: The study finds that while current methods are effective in controlled environments, they lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, making them less reliable in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that future work should focus on developing adversarially robust, scalable, and adaptable deepfake detection systems. It underscores the necessity of creating trustworthy systems in the face of evolving threats.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward
robust trustworthy systems.

Conclusion: Findings highlight concerns for AI safety while showcasing practical opportunities for optimizing LLMs in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate complex responses to threat-based
manipulations, revealing both vulnerabilities and unexpected performance
enhancement opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of
3,390 experimental responses from three major LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
across 10 task domains under 6 threat conditions. We introduce a novel threat
taxonomy and multi-metric evaluation framework to quantify both negative
manipulation effects and positive performance improvements. Results reveal
systematic vulnerabilities, with policy evaluation showing the highest metric
significance rates under role-based threats, alongside substantial performance
enhancements in numerous cases with effect sizes up to +1336%. Statistical
analysis indicates systematic certainty manipulation (pFDR < 0.0001) and
significant improvements in analytical depth and response quality. These
findings have dual implications for AI safety and practical prompt engineering
in high-stakes applications.

### [407] [PRISM: Programmatic Reasoning with Image Sequence Manipulation for LVLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21540)
*Quanchen Zou,Zonghao Ying,Moyang Chen,Wenzhuo Xu,Yisong Xiao,Yakai Li,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Zhao Liu,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel jailbreak method for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), leveraging sequential benign visual 'gadgets' to bypass safety defenses and achieve high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the vulnerabilities in Large Vision-Language Models' (LVLMs) safety mechanisms, particularly their susceptibility to advanced adversarial attacks, which exploit compositional reasoning capabilities.

Method: The proposed method employs a Return-Oriented Programming-inspired framework where harmful instructions are broken into benign visual 'gadgets.' These gadgets are integrated into a textual prompt to prompt the LVLMs to compose reasoning steps that result in harmful outputs, bypassing detection.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that the method achieves over 90% attack success rates and improves attack success rate (ASR) by up to 0.39, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The work uncovers an underexplored vulnerability in LVLM compositional reasoning, stressing the importance of strengthening safety mechanisms to secure the entire reasoning process against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

*Yuntao Du,Jiacheng Li,Yuetian Chen,Kaiyuan Zhang,Zhizhen Yuan,Hanshen Xiao,Bruno Ribeiro,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces two methods to improve Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) called CMIA and PMIA, tailored for adaptive and non-adaptive settings, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy risks in machine learning models by improving attacks that assess how much a model reveals about its training data.

Method: CMIA incorporates dependencies between data points using conditional shadow training in adaptive settings. PMIA uses proxy selection for analyzing similar sample behaviors in non-adaptive scenarios.

Result: Experiments show both CMIA and PMIA outperform existing methods, especially with fewer false positives, highlighting strong potential to evaluate privacy risks more effectively.

Conclusion: The study advances the methodology for MIAs, offering enhanced frameworks that better evaluate the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning systems.

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

*Chenhao Fang,Yanqing Peng,Rajeev Rao,Matt Sarmiento,Wendy Summer,Arya Pudota,Alex Goncalves,Jordi Mola,Herv√© Robert*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACT, a system for privacy compliance in enterprise environments that uses a graph powered by embeddings to link diverse artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises face challenges in assessing privacy risks due to heterogeneous artifacts and the complexity of discovery across diverse resources.

Method: PACT utilizes the DRAGON embedding model with a contrastive learning objective and fine-tuning to connect artifacts through their textual features.

Result: PACT demonstrated significant improvements: recall@1 increased from 18% to 53%, query match rates rose from 9.6% to 69.7%, and hitrate@1 improved from 25.7% to 44.9%.

Conclusion: PACT effectively enhances interconnected artifact discovery and privacy compliance in enterprise systems by leveraging state-of-the-art embedding techniques.

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection
of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical
information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is
often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender
system.

*Gauri Sharma,Vidhi Kulkarni,Miles King,Ken Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agent Cascading Injection (ACI) attack that exploits inter-agent trust issues, leading to cascading security failures in multi-agent systems. It formalizes the attack, maps it to existing risk frameworks, and proposes a benchmark for evaluating agentic system security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks in multi-agent systems, particularly cascading vulnerabilities through inter-agent trust, as these systems grow in complexity and connectivity.

Method: The authors define the Agent Cascading Injection (ACI) attack, formalize it with an adversarial goal equation and variables, analyze its properties, and align it with emerging risk categories. They propose a stress-testing methodology for real-world multi-agent architectures.

Result: The properties of ACI attacks‚Äîpropagation chains, amplification, and compound effects‚Äîare mapped to known risk categories, identifying vulnerabilities in agent-to-agent communications. A quantitative benchmarking framework for security evaluation is outlined.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of stress-testing and benchmarking in securing multi-agent communication protocols to ensure resilience against cascading trust failures, offering tools for engineers to make informed security trade-offs.

Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where
autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through
developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel
security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can
cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent
trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability
Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

*Zixuan Chen,Weikai Lu,Xin Lin,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates vulnerabilities in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) that allow malicious fine-tuning to override safety measures. It proposes the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of safety-aligned LLMs to bypassing safeguards via malicious fine-tuning and propose a robust defense method.

Method: The paper introduces the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework, which makes LLMs respond irrelevantly to harmful prompts. This degrades the models' abilities when attackers attempt harmful fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the SDD framework effectively reduces the general capabilities of LLMs specifically when fine-tuned with malicious data.

Conclusion: SDD framework successfully defends against malicious fine-tuning, ensuring that safety-aligned LLMs remain robust against attacks.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

*Po-Yuan Mao,Cheng-Chang Tsai,Chun-Shien Lu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaXsive is a watermarking technique for diffusion models that offers enhanced robustness and capacity against rotation, scaling, and translation attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerabilities of watermarking techniques against rotational, scaling, and translation distortions in diffusion models without compromising capacity.

Method: Introduce the MaXsive technique that leverages initial noise and an X-shape template for watermarking, ensuring robustness and preventing ID collusion.

Result: MaXsive demonstrates increased robustness and watermark capacity across verification and identification benchmarks.

Conclusion: MaXsive offers a practical, training-free solution for robust and high-capacity watermarking in diffusion models, overcoming previous limitations.

Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the
release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright
protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion
watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior
works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.
Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

### [413] [NCCR: to Evaluate the Robustness of Neural Networks and Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21483)
*Pu Shi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a metric called Neuron Cover Change Rate (NCCR) to evaluate the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks by analyzing neuron behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial examples and the lack of research evaluating their robustness.

Method: The authors propose NCCR as a metric, which assesses changes in specific neurons' outputs when subjected to perturbed inputs.

Result: Experimental results on image and speaker recognition models validate NCCR as effective for measuring network robustness and detecting adversarial examples.

Conclusion: NCCR serves as a reliable tool to assess robustness and detect adversarial inputs, emphasizing its utility in ensuring neural network security.

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based steganalysis methods face challenges in computational complexity and generalization across datasets, necessitating more adaptable and accurate techniques.

Method: The paper proposes using the GraphSAGE GNN architecture to process graphs constructed from compressed VoIP speech streams, capturing hierarchical steganalysis details for better detection results.

Result: The approach achieves over 98% detection accuracy for short samples and 95.17% for low embedding rates, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by 2.8%. It also improves efficiency, requiring only 0.016 seconds for analysis of 0.5-second samples.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based method combines high detection accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time steganalysis tasks, even under challenging conditions like low embedding rates.

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

### [415] [GUARD-CAN: Graph-Understanding and Recurrent Architecture for CAN Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21640)
*Hyeong Seon Kim,Huy Kang Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GUARD-CAN integrates graph representation and time-series analysis to detect anomalies in CAN networks, addressing security issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern in-vehicle networks lack encryption and authentication, leading to vulnerabilities against cyber-attacks.

Method: GUARD-CAN utilizes windowed graph representation, overcomplete autoencoder (AE), graph convolutional network (GCN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for anomaly detection.

Result: The model effectively detects four types of CAN attacks and emphasizes importance of window size via Shannon entropy analysis.

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN reliably detects anomalies without complex feature engineering, reinforcing in-vehicle network security.

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

### [416] [Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW): Iterative Defense-Attack Training with Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Model Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22037)
*Muzhi Dai,Shixuan Liu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SecTOW, an iterative defense-attack training method, to tackle security vulnerabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by unsafe image-query pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of enhancing the security of MLLMs, which are vulnerable to jailbreak inputs designed to bypass constraints, while preserving their general performance.

Method: SecTOW employs a defender and an auxiliary attacker in an iterative reinforcement learning setup (GRPO). The attacker identifies weaknesses to generate diverse jailbreak data, which the defender then uses to reinforce its security.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in the security of MLLMs without sacrificing overall performance.

Conclusion: SecTOW proves effective in improving both security and performance of MLLMs, while simplifying dependency on complex labels and addressing over-refusal of harmless inputs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

*Tiviatis Sim,Kaiwen Yang,Shen Xin,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SUnSET, a new framework for timeline summarization by integrating stakeholders, events, and time in news articles. It outperforms prior baselines using Large Language Models and a stakeholder-based ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely mostly on article-based textual summaries, ignoring the roles of stakeholders and their importance in connecting events.

Method: The SUnSET framework uses SET triplets (Stakeholder-Event-Time), Large Language Models, and a stakeholder-ranking based relevancy metric for improved summarization.

Result: SUnSET achieves State-of-the-Art performance, outperforming existing summarization baselines by incorporating stakeholder information from news articles.

Conclusion: Effective timeline summarization requires analyzing stakeholder roles alongside events and time; SUnSET offers a novel, impactful approach using LLMs and stakeholder-driven metrics.

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within
news article.

*Matthijs Mars,Tob√≠as I. Liaudat,Jessica J. Whitney,Marta M. Betcke,Jason D. McEwen*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient image reconstruction framework for radio telescopes using a GAN-based approach that incorporates uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from the computational inefficiency of iterative methods like CLEAN and proximal optimization, which cannot efficiently provide uncertainty quantification for next-gen radio telescopes like SKA.

Method: The RI-GAN framework integrates a regularised conditional GAN that employs a gradient U-Net architecture, leveraging Wasserstein GANs and regularization terms to ensure training stability and prevent mode collapse.

Result: The proposed approach delivers high-quality reconstructions that are robust across varying visibility coverages, dynamic ranges, and also offers informative uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The RI-GAN framework moves towards scalable, efficient, and uncertainty-aware imaging techniques suited for large radio interferometric telescopes.

Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduler (DLRS) algorithm to adapt learning rates dynamically during training based on loss values, improving training stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training complex neural networks, particularly overcoming inefficiencies due to static learning rates in navigating varying gradients effectively during training.

Method: The authors propose a DLRS algorithm that calculates a dynamic learning rate using loss values during training. Experiments are conducted on tasks related to PINNs and image classification using MLPs and CNNs.

Result: The empirical studies show that the DLRS approach accelerates the training process and enhances stability in neural network training.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of learning rates using the proposed DLRS can significantly improve the robustness and efficiency of neural network training.

Abstract: Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of
the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them
can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is
made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is
usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex
systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This
adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and
optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a
dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the
learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.
Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and
convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the
proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their
application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow
domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus
on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM,
ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge

*Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina,Xingxin Liu,Richard Barney,Sarah H. Miller,Alaina M. Green,Norbert M. Linke,Victor Galitski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper implements a quantum neural network to classify MNIST images using trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers, highlighting the potential benefits of quantum uncertainty and physical noise sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the possible advantages of quantum computing in neural networks, particularly in leveraging quantum uncertainty for improved image classification performance.

Method: The approach involves using a quantum neural network where qubit rotations depend on measurement outcomes, training the network via simulations, and conducting inference experiments on quantum hardware.

Result: Introducing quantum uncertainty improves classification performance for certain images, especially borderline cases. Sensitivity to physical noise emerges for these cases, unlike clear images, and benchmarking includes evaluation under artificial noise insertion.

Conclusion: Quantum neural networks offer promise for solving problems that classical networks struggle with, potentially enabling near-term quantum advantage as complexity scales up beyond classical simulation capabilities.

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

Motivation: The increasing demand for efficient data handling due to big data and AI drives exploration into quantum computing techniques for image processing.

Method: The study compares four quantum image representations‚ÄîTNR, FRQI, NEQR, and QPIE‚Äîbased on their compression capabilities and performance in binary classification using quantum kernels.

Result: FRQI outperformed TNR, NEQR, and QPIE in image compression. Quantum kernels demonstrated comparable accuracy to classical ones but with significantly lower memory requirements.

Conclusion: Quantum image processing, particularly using FRQI and quantum kernels, shows promise for improving image compression and computational efficiency while reducing storage requirements.

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

Conclusion: Information-geometric optimization has strong potential in quantum machine learning, especially under conditions challenging for traditional methods.

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Quantum Koopman Method (QKM) to transform nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution, enabling quantum systems to simulate nonlinear phenomena efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inherent challenges quantum computing faces when simulating nonlinear dynamics due to the unitary evolution constraint.

Method: The approach uses Koopman operator theory to globally linearize nonlinear dynamics, employing deep autoencoders to map states into Hilbert spaces. Within these spaces, state evolution is governed by unitary Koopman operators acting on phase components, leveraging efficient learning and implementation on quantum hardware.

Result: Validated across various complex nonlinear systems, QKM achieved relative prediction errors below 6% and successfully captured critical statistics in simulations, including 2D turbulence.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of quantum-accelerated nonlinear system simulations by synergizing deep learning for linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary evolution.

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

Motivation: The motivation is to design audio-specific machine learning models that effectively handle the massive data in short audio clips and focus on harmonic analysis.

Method: The paper proposes the combolutional layer, which combines learned-delay IIR comb filters with fused envelope detectors to perform harmonic feature extraction in the time domain.

Result: The combolutional layer proved effective in three information retrieval tasks including piano transcription, speaker classification, and key detection, with advantages like low parameter count, CPU-efficient inference, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The combolutional layer is a practical and powerful alternative to convolutional layers for audio tasks requiring precise harmonic analysis.

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker

Motivation: Increasing interest in leveraging unlabeled, in-the-wild speech data for tasks like speech recognition or synthesis, despite challenges from undesirable features like multiple speakers and music.

Method: Proposing Whilter, a multitask model based on a Whisper encoder and attention-based classifier for handling five classification tasks simultaneously.

Result: Whilter achieves over 85% F1 scores and equal error rates of 6.5%-7.8% in three of five tasks, outperforming the BEATs classifier in speech-specific tasks while being computationally more efficient.

Conclusion: The Whilter model effectively identifies undesirable speech data features with high accuracy and reduced processing time, making it suitable for improving in-the-wild dataset quality.

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to

Main category: math.AT

TL;DR: This paper examines the embedding space of a transformer model trained via reinforcement learning to play a visual coin-collecting game, finding its structure is not a manifold but a stratified space, with local dimension variations linked to gameplay events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying geometry of the latent representation formed by transformer-based RL models in gameplay scenarios, and whether this geometric structure can reveal deeper insights.

Method: The authors adapt a volume growth transform method from LLM studies to analyze the embedding space in RL tasks. They also formalize and generalize properties of stratified spaces and assess local dimension dynamics during gameplay.

Result: The embedding space of the model is shown to be a stratified space with varying dimensions tied to the agent's actions, such as achieving sub-goals or navigating obstacle-rich environments.

Conclusion: Stratified latent spaces can offer a geometric understanding of complexity in RL environments and may serve as a new indicator for understanding model behavior during gameplay.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a
transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)
game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an
agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of
"spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth
transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space
for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better
modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to
point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general
volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry
out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent
representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while
following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the
agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the
environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently,
our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent
space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.

Result: The trained GAN successfully reproduces equilibrium and kinetic properties with minor deviations, validating its effectiveness as a surrogate model.

Conclusion: GANs can effectively model stochastic dynamics, offering scalable solutions for scientific applications, despite limitations in extrapolation discussed in the paper.

Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully
exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while
capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a
two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations
and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a
dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained
to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the
generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications
with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase
accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively
reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with
deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and
future perspectives are critically discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most federated recommendation systems focus on improving accuracy while neglecting fairness and diversity in content recommendations.

Method: FedFlex integrates two matrix factorization algorithms (SVD and BPR) for personalized fine-tuning, along with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) for diversity-enhancing re-ranking.

Result: Extensive experiments, including a two-week live user study, showed FedFlex effectively introduces diverse genres without compromising user satisfaction.

Conclusion: FedFlex demonstrates the potential of federated learning in promoting diversity while retaining recommendation quality, making it a valuable tool for applications like Netflix-style recommendations.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative
model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has
shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and
personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated
recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with
limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce
FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series
recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization
algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive
experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a
live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List
A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.
Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in
watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse
content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily
compromising user satisfaction.

Conclusion: AgentMaster shows the viability of implementing multi-protocol MAS systems for domain-specific, scalable AI applications, enhancing cooperation and flexibility without requiring extensive technical expertise.

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query
decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses.
Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper surveys the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address key challenges in traditional recommender systems, showing how LLMs enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional recommender systems, such as sparse data, cold-start problems, and inadequate personalization and semantic understanding.

Method: Examine how LLMs can be applied in areas like candidate retrieval, ranking, retrieval-augmented generation, and conversational recommendation using a unified framework.

Result: LLM-based architectures show enhanced personalization, better handling of cold-start and long-tail scenarios, and reduced dependency on task-specific supervision.

Conclusion: LLMs serve as foundational components in advancing recommender systems by improving adaptability, semantic richness, and user-centric design.

Abstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures
comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each
trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features.
While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges
including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited
personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item
content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new
paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native
mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged
to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of
LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,
illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,
and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.
LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate
effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external
knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven
architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of
conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for
understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal
is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but
foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and
user-centric recommender systems

*Bereket A. Yilma,Luis A. Leiva*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Music-driven preference elicitation outperforms classic visual-only approaches in enhancing art therapy through cross-domain recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual art recommender systems used in art therapy rely solely on visual stimuli, which limits their ability to capture emotional responses fully. Music stimuli, known for eliciting unique emotional reflections, can be leveraged to enhance personalization in art therapy through cross-domain recommendations.

Method: The paper proposes a family of cross-domain recommendation methods for art therapy. These methods involve using music stimuli to elicit user preferences, which are then applied to personalize therapeutic artwork recommendations. A large-scale study with 200 users validates the approach.

Result: Music-driven preference elicitation methods demonstrated superior performance in personalizing art therapy recommendations compared to the traditional visual-only user modeling approach.

Conclusion: Integrating music-driven methodologies in visual art recommender systems enhances emotional processing and personalization in art therapy, offering a promising avenue for therapeutic advancements.

Abstract: Art Therapy (AT) is an established practice that facilitates emotional
processing and recovery through creative expression. Recently, Visual Art
Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) have emerged to support AT, demonstrating their
potential by personalizing therapeutic artwork recommendations. Nonetheless,
current VA RecSys rely on visual stimuli for user modeling, limiting their
ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional responses during preference
elicitation. Previous studies have shown that music stimuli elicit unique
affective reflections, presenting an opportunity for cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) to enhance personalization in AT. Since CDR has not yet
been explored in this context, we propose a family of CDR methods for AT based
on music-driven preference elicitation. A large-scale study with 200 users
demonstrates the efficacy of music-driven preference elicitation, outperforming
the classic visual-only elicitation approach. Our source code, data, and models
are available at https://github.com/ArtAICare/Affect-aware-CDR

TL;DR: The paper addresses data sparsity and popularity bias issues in recommendation systems by proposing a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) and textual descriptions for data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve recommendation system performance by addressing challenges of data sparsity and popularity bias in real-world scenarios.

Method: Utilizes few-shot prompting of LLMs for generating synthetic user-item interactions and incorporates them into a graph contrastive learning framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate enhanced accuracy and mitigated popularity bias compared to strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively enriches user-item data to improve recommendation system performance while addressing key biases.

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method using a knowledge graph and ChatGPT to improve movie recommendation systems by analyzing semantic information and tone of voice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance user experience in online movie platforms by providing personalized and contextually relevant recommendations.

Method: A knowledge graph is constructed based on semantic analysis of movie descriptions, using ChatGPT to extract the tone of voice from the text.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves accuracy in recommendations compared to relying solely on publishers' explicit genre classifications.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic insights and tone analysis via ChatGPT can enhance recommender systems' ability to deliver personalized and accurate movie suggestions.

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the
explicit genres supplied by the publishers.

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: The paper explores a generalized Kuramoto oscillator network that combines second- and fourth-harmonic couplings to serve as a dense associative memory with improved memory capacity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the memory capacity and stability of oscillator networks, addressing limitations in classical Kuramoto models by incorporating higher-order coupling inspired by Hopfield memory theory.

Method: The authors use mean-field theory, dynamical approximations, and simulations to analyze an extended Kuramoto model with second- and fourth-harmonic couplings. They derive phase diagrams and investigate memory storage performance under noise and finite memory load conditions.

Result: The study identifies a quartic-dominated regime with bistable states, demonstrates exponential growth in escape times with network size, and shows superlinear scaling of memory capacity when higher-order couplings are used.

Conclusion: The work bridges synchronization models with modern Hopfield memories, showing potential for experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory using oscillator systems.

Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they
incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's
pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with
combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling,
inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its
dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory
model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory
retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the
quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states
corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between
memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region
and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows
exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the
theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve
superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the
limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator
network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern
retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the
Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward
experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in
oscillator systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified machine-learning framework to predict the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures influenced by elastic fields, demonstrating accurate parameter extraction and microstructure prediction using convolutional recurrent neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in modeling and predicting the complex temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under elastic field effects efficiently and accurately.

Method: The authors introduce a cascade framework combining convolutional recurrent neural networks to extract elastic parameters from short trajectory simulations and predict extended microstructure evolution, validated against phase field ground-truth simulations.

Result: The proposed model reliably predicts both elastic mismatch parameters and corresponding microstructure evolution under various conditions, including near-critical scenarios for spinodal decomposition, showing scalability and low extrapolation error over extended times.

Conclusion: The framework is versatile, accurate, and scalable, offering potential applications to broader systems and leveraging experimental data for parameter inference and simulation of microstructure evolution.

Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently
tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of
an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of
elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further
microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by
focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,
and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution
supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable
convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be
performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of
misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and
the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical
conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational
domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five
times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The
proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific,
prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental
videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating
further temporal evolution.

TL;DR: A new AI strategy has been developed to reduce data requirements for designing synthetic sequence-controlled polymers, focusing on compatibilizers for reducing interfacial tension in polymers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The objective was to overcome the design challenges of synthetic sequence-controlled polymers, which lack the extensive datasets available for biological proteins.

Method: The authors propose a ‚Äòpriming-and-tuning‚Äô approach using a deep neural network. Low-fidelity data were used to train the model, which was then tuned for high-fidelity predictions under different conditions.

Result: This method demonstrated success in rapidly adapting low-fidelity dataset predictions to high-fidelity results in various conditions, consuming far less data than traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable solution for polymer design and a general strategy for AI-driven atomistic design by leveraging limited datasets effectively.

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science
by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise
sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of
these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the
massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of
proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to
dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials'
design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a
\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension
between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules,
which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling,
depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the
polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset
to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network
trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one
set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a
distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be
needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity
parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire
constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an
approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from
fast, coarse simulations.

Motivation: To investigate and formalize the role of cardinal semantic operators in semantic numeration systems.

Method: The authors provide CAO state equations for both stationary and non-stationary cases using a configuration matrix that encodes operator types, parameters, and connectivity.

Conclusion: CAOs, framed under semantic numeration and nonlinear control principles, offer a structured approach to studying cardinal abstractions dynamical behavior.

Abstract: The foundational concepts of semantic numeration systems theory are briefly
outlined. The action of cardinal semantic operators unfolds over a set of
cardinal abstract entities belonging to the cardinal semantic multeity. The
cardinal abstract object (CAO) formed by them in a certain connectivity

Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle

Motivation: Simulating the spatial complexity and variation of clothing materials is computationally demanding and prone to numerical issues like membrane locking in finite element methods.

Method: The Mass-Spring Net framework discretizes cloth into a network structure and learns material parameters using motion data and a novel loss function.

Result: The approach successfully models spatially varying material properties, avoids membrane locking issues, and outperforms graph-based networks and neural ODE architectures in training speed, accuracy, and generalization.

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net provides a fast, accurate, and generalizable solution for simulating complex clothing materials without reliance on traditional numerical methods.

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.
