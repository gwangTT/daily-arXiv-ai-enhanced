### [1] [Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14214)
*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies how Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluate emotionally charged stimuli and compares their ratings to human evaluations, finding high alignment but notable differences in arousal ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how LLMs interpret emotional stimuli and their alignment with human behavior to assess their potential for roles and interactions in everyday life.

Method: The authors compared emotional ratings from multiple popular LLMs with previously collected human ratings for datasets comprising words and images.

Result: LLMs, such as GPT-4, aligned highly with human emotional ratings for many scales (correlation r = 0.9 or higher), particularly on happiness. However, there were weaker alignments in arousal ratings, and LLM ratings were found to be more consistent than human ratings.

Conclusion: The study highlights similarities and differences between human and LLM evaluations of emotional content, suggesting that while LLMs can model emotional interpretation well, there are notable gaps, especially in certain dimensions like arousal.

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

### [2] [Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14294)
*Maria Leonor Pacheco,Fabio Somenzi,Dananjay Srinivas,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neurosymbolic framework combining decision-making tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain complex decision sequences using Hitori puzzles as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human understanding of complex sequences of decisions by combining the strengths of decision procedures and LLMs.

Method: A neurosymbolic approach using SAT solvers for local constraints and LLMs for visual explanations, demonstrated through Hitori puzzle solving.

Result: An implemented tool that effectively assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles, supported by experimental evidence.

Conclusion: Combining SAT solvers with LLMs provides a flexible and effective method for explaining complex decision-making processes in tasks such as Hitori puzzles.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

### [3] [Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)
*Beinuo Yang,Qishen Zhou,Junyi Li,Xingchen Su,Simon Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORThought, a framework leveraging expert principles and chain-of-thought reasoning for improving optimization modeling, addressing major limitations like labeling errors and inefficiency, while outperforming other methods in complex problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization modeling is crucial for decision-making but is hindered by time consumption, errors, and reliance on domain experts. Existing LLM methods show promise but face challenges like high error rates, narrow evaluation scope, and inefficiency.

Method: The study corrects errors in existing datasets, creates LogiOR for complex logistic problems, and proposes ORThought, a chain-of-thought reasoning framework to automate the optimization modeling process.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that ORThought significantly outperforms existing methods, especially for complex optimization problems, by addressing key inefficiencies and inaccuracies.

Conclusion: ORThought offers a robust solution for LLM-based optimization modeling, providing insights on success factors and failure modes while demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

### [4] [The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)
*Qiang Zhang,Pei Yan,Yijia Xu,Chuanpo Fu,Yong Fang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the behavioral differences between humans and AI agents in networked environments, proposing models to address challenges like trust and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in trust, ethics, and security resulting from increasingly human-like behaviors of AI agents in networked environments.

Method: Proposed the 'Network Behavior Lifecycle' model to categorize behaviors; introduced the A4A paradigm and HABD model to differentiate human and agent behaviors across five dimensions.

Result: The models were validated through real-world cases, such as red team penetration and blue team defense.

Conclusion: The insights aim to guide secure and trustworthy human-agent collaboration, proposing future research in dynamic governance and meta-protocol developments.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

### [5] [Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564)
*Luca Annese,Sabrina Patania,Silvia Serino,Tom Foulsham,Silvia Rossi,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores ways to enhance large language model (LLM)-based agents in perspective-taking tasks via structured solution examples, but shows such enhancements are insufficient for robust improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate methods to improve LLM-based agents in reasoning tasks involving active perception, collaboration, and understanding another agent's perspective.

Method: Utilized a structured solution-processing pipeline generating examples based on paths and decisions, converted into "thought-action" examples using LLM reasoning prompts.

Result: While examples slightly improved performance in some tasks, agents struggled with complex scenarios like reasoning about occluded spaces or assessing epistemic action costs.

Conclusion: Structured examples are insufficient, and future improvements must involve explicit belief tracking, cost modeling, and enriched environments for effective perspective-taking.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

### [6] [LeanGeo: Formalizing Competitional Geometry problems in Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14644)
*Chendong Song,Zihan Wang,Frederick Pu,Haiming Wang,Xiaohan Lin,Junqi Liu,Jia Li,Zhengying Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanGeo is a formal system to solve competition-level geometry problems using the Lean 4 theorem prover, along with LeanGeo-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating automated geometric reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified frameworks for solving and verifying geometry problems rigorously, and to enable integration with other mathematical fields.

Method: Developing LeanGeo, which combines a library of geometric theorems with Lean's foundational logic, and creating LeanGeo-Bench, a benchmark with competition-level problems.

Result: LeanGeo successfully formalizes geometry problems and evaluates current large language models, showcasing both their strengths and weaknesses in geometric reasoning.

Conclusion: LeanGeo serves as an innovative system for rigorous geometry problem solving and benchmarking, but advancements in automated reasoning are still needed.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

### [7] [Entropy-Constrained Strategy Optimization in Urban Floods: A Multi-Agent Framework with LLM and Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654)
*Peilin Ji,Xiao Xue,Simeng Wang,Wenhao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-J, a hierarchical framework to enhance urban flood emergency scheduling using advanced AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant challenges in emergency scheduling during urban flooding, such as managing trade-offs between traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation.

Method: The proposed framework, H-J, combines knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization in a unified pipeline.

Result: H-J demonstrated superior performance compared to rule-based and reinforcement-learning methods in traffic management, task success, and system robustness under various rainfall conditions.

Conclusion: The study suggests that advanced uncertainty-aware and knowledge-constrained AI strategies can significantly improve urban flood response systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

### [8] [MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14704)
*Ziyang Luo,Zhiqi Shen,Wenzhuo Yang,Zirui Zhao,Prathyusha Jwalapuram,Amrita Saha,Doyen Sahoo,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Junnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors introduce MCP-Universe, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in real-world and challenging tasks using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs are overly simple and fail to address real-world challenges like long-horizon reasoning and interactions with unfamiliar toolsets.

Method: MCP-Universe evaluates LLMs across 6 domains and 11 MCP servers using execution-based evaluators, encompassing static, dynamic, and format compliance checks.

Result: State-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as GPT-5, Grok-4, and Claude-4.0-Sonnet show limited performance, with task accuracy scores of 43.72%, 33.33%, and 29.44%, respectively. The benchmark also highlights challenges related to long-context and unknown tool usage.

Conclusion: MCP-Universe exposes performance limitations of SOTA LLMs while offering an open-source, extensible framework to advance research in complex LLM-MCP interactions.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

### [9] [Data-Driven Probabilistic Evaluation of Logic Properties with PAC-Confidence on Mealy Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14710)
*Swantje Plambeck,Ali Salamati,Eyke Huellermeier,Goerschwin Fey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a PAC learning-based method for estimating the safety probability of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) modeled as Mealy machines, applying active learning and validated with a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS often lack suitable or easily extracted models for important tasks like verification and diagnosis, necessitating data-driven approaches for solving these challenges.

Method: The paper introduces a PAC learning-based, data-driven approach that uses active learning to iteratively refine data collection and estimate the safety probability of CPS over a finite time horizon.

Result: The proposed approach is validated through a case study on an automated lane-keeping system, establishing its effectiveness for safety probability estimation on CPS.

Conclusion: The study connects discrete logic with probabilistic reachability analysis, offering a systematic and confidence-enhanced way to assess CPS safety using active, data-driven learning.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores AI introspection, proposing a refined definition and demonstrating its practical importance using LLMs reasoning about internal temperature parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus on defining AI introspection and to explore whether language models (LLMs) can introspect.

Method: The paper proposes a new definition of introspection in AI and tests it through experiments involving language models reasoning about their internal temperature parameters.

Result: LLMs can exhibit lightweight introspection but fail the proposed 'thicker' definition which demands more reliable insights into internal states.

Conclusion: AI introspection should be defined rigorously; current models demonstrate limited true introspective ability based on the proposed framework.

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

### [11] [MAHL: Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Hierarchical Chiplet Design with Adaptive Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14053)
*Jinwei Tang,Jiayin Qin,Nuo Xu,Pragnya Sudershan Nalla,Yu Cao,Yang,Zhao,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based framework for efficient and accurate chiplet design, significantly improving Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high-dimensionality and inefficiencies in modern chip design processes, particularly as program workloads and algorithmic complexities grow.

Method: The method incorporates six collaborative agents specializing in tasks such as hierarchical description generation, code retrieval-augmentation, diverse-flow validation, and design space exploration to optimize chiplet designs.

Result: MAHL demonstrated significant improvements in simple and real-world RTL chiplet design generation accuracy, achieving a Pass@5 score of 0.72 from 0 compared to conventional LLMs, while matching or outperforming state-of-the-art expert-based methods in PPA results.

Conclusion: MAHL's hierarchical approach enhances chiplet design generation efficiency and accuracy, proving its potential as a promising alternative to both conventional LLMs and expert-based frameworks.

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity,
the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing
cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles,
innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited
from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,
placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently
demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an
advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,
LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high
validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet
design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based
chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which
collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical
description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based
validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components
together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized
Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only
significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also
increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by
Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case
scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves
comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

### [12] [Revisit Choice Network for Synthesis and Technology Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14068)
*Chen Chen,Jiaqi Yin,Cunxi Yu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents Cristal, a framework for Boolean choice network construction, achieving better area, delay reductions, and significant runtime improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural bias and improve the quality of choices in Boolean optimization for technology mapping, equivalence checking, and ensuring better optimization compared to prior methods.

Method: The authors propose Cristal, which includes methods like representative logic cone search, structural mutation enabled by equality saturation, priority-ranking of choices, and a new flow for choice network validation and construction.

Result: Cristal achieves reductions in area and delay (e.g., 3.85%/8.35% in delay-oriented mode), while offering a significant runtime improvement (63.77%) using benchmarks across IWLS 2005, ISCAS'89, and EPFL suites.

Conclusion: Cristal enhances Boolean choice network construction by generating fewer but higher-quality choices, leading to superior performance in efficiency, area, and delay metrics compared to existing methodologies.

Abstract: Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating
structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and
technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent
optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers
to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a
subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the
quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute
to effective technology mapping.
  This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for
constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new
flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative
logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures
via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with
choice network construction and validation. Through these techniques, Cristal
constructs fewer but higher-quality choices.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that Cristal outperforms the
state-of-the-art Boolean choice network construction implemented in ABC in the
post-mapping stage, achieving average reductions of 3.85%/8.35% (area/delay) in
delay-oriented mode, 0.11%/2.74% in area-oriented mode, and a 63.77% runtime
reduction on large-scale cases across a diverse set of combinational circuits
from the IWLS 2005, ISCAS'89, and EPFL benchmark suites.

Motivation: To automate and simplify the process of designing photonic integrated circuits (PICs) using natural language inputs.

Method: Multi-agent framework utilizing 7 large language models to convert natural-language PIC design requests into layout mask files, tested on 102 design descriptions of varying complexities.

Result: Achieved up to 91% success for single-device designs; for designs with ≤15 components, certain models like Gemini-2.5-pro achieved top success rates (~57%) with low cost and minimal output tokens.

Conclusion: PhIDO demonstrates potential for autonomous PIC design, but future work is needed on standardized knowledge representations, expanded datasets, verification methods, and robotic automation.

Abstract: We present Photonics Intelligent Design and Optimization (PhIDO), a
multi-agent framework that converts natural-language photonic integrated
circuit (PIC) design requests into layout mask files. We compare 7 reasoning
large language models for PhIDO using a testbench of 102 design descriptions
that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for
single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with less than or equal
to 15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest
end-to-end pass@5 success rates of approximately 57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro
requiring the fewest output tokens and lowest cost. The next steps toward
autonomous PIC development include standardized knowledge representations,
expanded datasets, extended verification, and robotic automation.

Motivation: While VSAs are widely used for cognitive tasks and hardware solutions have been developed to support them, a unified discussion of their co-design potential between hardware and theoretical aspects remains lacking.

Method: The paper explores the principles and core operations of VSAs, compares hardware approaches (analog, mixed-signal, digital), and introduces a cross-layer design methodology for hardware/software co-design.

Result: The authors implement and demonstrate a novel in-memory computing hierarchical cognition hardware system, highlighting its efficiency, scalability, and flexibility as an example of the co-design approach.

Conclusion: The paper synthesizes insights into VSA hardware/software co-design, provides design guidelines, and identifies open research challenges for future development in the field.

Abstract: Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) have been widely deployed in various
cognitive applications due to their simple and efficient operations. The
widespread adoption of VSAs has, in turn, spurred the development of numerous
hardware solutions aimed at optimizing their performance. Despite these
advancements, a comprehensive and unified discourse on the convergence of
hardware and algorithms in the context of VSAs remains somewhat limited. The
paper aims to bridge the gap between theoretical software-level explorations
and the development of efficient hardware architectures and emerging technology
fabrics for VSAs, providing insights from the co-design aspect for researchers
from either side. First, we introduce the principles of vector-symbolic
computing, including its core mathematical operations and learning paradigms.
Second, we provide an in-depth discussion on hardware technologies for VSAs,
analyzing analog, mixed-signal, and digital circuit design styles. We compare
hardware implementations of VSAs by carrying out detailed analysis of their
performance characteristics and tradeoffs, allowing us to extract design
guidelines for the development of arbitrary VSA formulations. Third, we discuss
a methodology for cross-layer design of VSAs that identifies synergies across
layers and explores key ingredients for hardware/software co-design of VSAs.
Finally, as a concrete demonstration of this methodology, we propose the first
in-memory computing hierarchical cognition hardware system, showcasing the
efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of this co-design approach. The paper
concludes with a discussion of open research challenges for future
explorations.

TL;DR: The paper identifies power management challenges in large AI training workloads involving thousands of GPUs, caused by power swings during compute-heavy and communication-heavy phases. It proposes and tests multi-layered solutions to mitigate these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Power swings during large AI workloads can potentially harm the power grid infrastructure and limit scalability. Addressing this concern is critical for safe scaling of AI training.

Method: The paper explores solutions across software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure, testing these approaches using real hardware and a cloud power simulator.

Result: The presented solutions are evaluated rigorously, offering insights into their effectiveness in stabilizing power under real-world AI training conditions.

Conclusion: A multi-pronged approach is essential to address unique power challenges in large AI workloads, ensuring scalability and safety for future AI infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens
of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise
due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the
synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a
computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a
communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because
compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large
power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with
the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from
the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical
frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid
infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we
need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the
challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the
stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the
pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged
approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested
using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power
simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions
under real-world conditions.

*Choongseok Song,Doo Seok Jeong*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel CIM dataflow to address inefficiencies in handling depthwise convolution in edge AI devices, achieving significant reductions in buffer traffic, energy, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges faced by CIM macros, especially underutilization of memory and excessive buffer traffic during depthwise convolution. These issues hinder CIM's potential for high energy efficiency in edge AI devices.

Method: The authors introduce and demonstrate a novel CIM dataflow grounded in theoretical principles, aimed at maximizing data reuse and memory utilization to reduce buffer traffic.

Result: The proposed dataflow achieves 77.4-87.0% reduction in buffer traffic and consequential reductions in data traffic energy (10.1-17.9%) and latency (15.6-27.8%) when applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models.

Conclusion: The CIM dataflow greatly improves the efficiency of edge AI devices by addressing overlooked challenges in buffer traffic, thus enhancing the energy and latency profiles of lightweight, depthwise convolution models.

Abstract: Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall
issue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement,
making it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like
MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature
extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often
face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including
underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in
particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and
energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that
significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving
memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is
grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.
When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer
traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and
latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline
(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).

*Ruiyang Ma,Daikang Kuang,Ziqian Liu,Jiaxi Zhang,Ping Fan,Guojie Luo*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, Wit-HW, that transforms hardware bug localization into a test generation problem to improve debugging efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hardware debugging techniques fail for large designs and deeply rooted bugs due to reliance on single test cases, hindering root cause analysis.

Method: The authors utilize spectrum-based methods and mutation-based strategies to generate effective witness test cases, which are analyzed to localize hardware bugs.

Result: Wit-HW effectively localized 49%, 73%, and 88% of bugs within Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10 ranks, outperforming current techniques, and demonstrated robust performance on real-world cases.

Conclusion: By generating and analyzing witness test cases, Wit-HW significantly enhances hardware bug localization, offering a scalable and effective solution for intricate hardware systems.

Abstract: Debugging hardware designs requires significant manual effort during hardware
development. After engineers identify a bug-triggering test case in
simulation-based hardware verification, they usually spend considerable time
analyzing the execution trace to localize the bug. Although numerous automated
hardware debugging techniques exist, they are not applicable to large designs
and deep bugs. A primary reason for their limitations is that these techniques
only utilize the information of a single bug-triggering test case for bug
localization, which prevents them from effectively analyzing intricate hardware
systems and figure out the root cause of bugs. To solve this problem, in this
paper, we transform the hardware bug localization problem into a test
generation problem, aiming to find a set of effective witness test cases beyond
the initial bug-triggering test case to enhance hardware bug localization.
Witness test cases refer to the cases that do not trigger the bug in the faulty
design. By analyzing the execution differences between passing and failing test
cases with spectrum-based method, we can eliminate innocent design statements
and localize the buggy ones. To further refine the suspicious area, we define
the criteria for effective witness test cases and use a mutation-based strategy
to generate such test cases. Based on this approach, we propose an automated
hardware bug localization framework named Wit-HW. We evaluate Wit-HW on 41 bugs
from various hardware designs. The experimental results show that Wit-HW
effectively localize 49%, 73%, 88% bugs within Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 ranks,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art bug localization techniques.
Additionally, we evaluate Wit-HW on 13 real-world bugs collected from
open-source hardware projects, showcasing the robust performance of our method.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A new open-source IP core, ListenToJESD204B, facilitates efficient high-bandwidth data transfer for ultrasound systems, reducing resource usage and costs compared to conventional solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound systems require high-bandwidth, synchronized data channels that exceed the limitations of traditional solutions. Current commercial IP cores addressing these needs are restrictive, expensive, and resource-intensive.

Method: Developed in synthesizable SystemVerilog, the ListenToJESD204B IP core supports four lanes at 12.8 Gb/s with deterministic latency and efficient resource utilization, verified through simulation and hardware testing.

Result: ListenToJESD204B achieved a 79% reduction in resource usage compared to commercial IP cores, and demonstrated error-free data streaming for 30 minutes at 80 MSPS, 16-bit resolution over high-speed links.

Conclusion: The ListenToJESD204B core offers a cost-effective, resource-efficient alternative for high-speed data synchronization in ultrasound systems, enabling scalable and reliable performance.

Abstract: The demand for hundreds of tightly synchronized channels operating at tens of
MSPS in ultrasound systems exceeds conventional low-voltage differential
signaling links' bandwidth, pin count, and latency. Although the JESD204B
serial interface mitigates these limitations, commercial FPGA IP cores are
proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive. We present ListenToJESD204B, an
open-source receiver IP core released under a permissive Solderpad 0.51 license
for AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ devices. Written in synthesizable
SystemVerilog, the core supports four GTH/GTY lanes at 12.8 Gb/s and provides
cycle-accurate AXI-Stream data alongside deterministic Subclass~1 latency. It
occupies only 107 configurable logic blocks (approximately 437 LUTs),
representing a 79\% reduction compared to comparable commercially available IP.
A modular data path featuring per-lane elastic buffers, SYSREF-locked LMFC
generation, and optional LFSR descrambling facilitates scaling to high lane
counts. We verified protocol compliance through simulation against the Xilinx
JESD204C IP in JESD204B mode and on hardware using TI AFE58JD48 ADCs. Block
stability was verified by streaming 80 MSPS, 16-bit samples over two 12.8 Gb/s
links for 30 minutes with no errors.

### [20] [From Image Captioning to Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14045)
*Admitos Passadakis,Yingjin Song,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for Visual Storytelling by combining image captioning and narrative generation, enhancing story quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating stories from image streams that are both grounded in images and narratively coherent.

Method: The proposed method uses a vision-to-language model for generating image captions and a language-to-language model for converting these captions into coherent narratives.

Result: Integrating captioning and storytelling within a unified framework improves story quality, accelerates training, and ensures reusability. A new metric, 'ideality,' is also introduced for evaluating human-likeness in storytelling.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances grounding and coherence in storytelling, offering enhanced accessibility and performance for Visual Storytelling tasks.

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

Abstract: We introduce the first taxonomy-guided evaluation of Swahili NLP, addressing
gaps in sociolinguistic diversity. Drawing on health-related psychometric
tasks, we collect a dataset of 2,170 free-text responses from Kenyan speakers.
The data exhibits tribal influences, urban vernacular, code-mixing, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study contrasts English and Chinese news articles, analyzing differences in constituent order, particularly focusing on functional chunks with adverbial roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural and positional preference differences in English and Chinese information presentation using annotated corpora.

Method: Analysis of annotated English-Chinese news corpora using functional chunk-based positional and distribution analysis methods.

Result: (1) English prefers core information first with post-positioned functional chunks, while Chinese prefers background information first with pre-positioned chunks. (2) Both languages show distribution differences in SVO structures, with Chinese leaning towards pre-positioning. (3) Co-occurring functional blocks exhibit flexibility in both languages influenced by information and pragmatics.

Conclusion: Word order reflects systematic preferences and dynamic adaptability in English and Chinese, offering empirical insights into their contrastive information structures.

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

TL;DR: This paper tackles confidence estimation in text-to-SQL conversions, studying methods for evaluating reliability of SQL queries generated by large language models without gold answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve confidence estimation for SQL queries arising from text input, particularly in scenarios where model internals (weights and gradients) are inaccessible.

Method: The paper examines black-box and white-box strategies, employing consistency-based methods for black-box models and SQL-syntax-aware techniques for LLM logits in white-box models.

Result: Consistency-based approaches perform well among black-box setups, while SQL-syntax-aware methods excel in white-box models. Execution-based query grounding enhances the effectiveness of both types.

Conclusion: Both strategies benefit from execution-based signal grounding, implying a practical improvement in text-to-SQL confidence estimation across diverse domains.

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates data memorization in fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a framework to mitigate privacy leakage without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks introduced by the memorization tendencies of LLMs, especially during fine-tuning processes.

Method: The study conducted controlled experiments on LLMs like GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, and introduced four privacy methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based filtering.

Result: Findings revealed that fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data significantly increases privacy risks, with leakage rates increasing from 0-5% to 60-75%. The proposed framework reduced leakage to 0% while maintaining 94.7% of the model's performance.

Conclusion: The multi-layered privacy framework effectively mitigates data memorization risks in LLMs without majorly compromising their utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how information propagates and is processed in large language models (LLMs) with a specific focus on punctuation tokens and reasoning rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the internal mechanisms of LLMs for information processing and its implications for interpretability.

Method: Intervention-based techniques, layer-swapping experiments, and analyzing static summaries across GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma.

Result: Punctuation has variable necessity and sufficiency across models, and reasoning rules like conditional statements and universal quantification are processed differently.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the diverse mechanisms LLMs use for processing punctuation and reasoning, emphasizing their complexity and model-specific behaviors.

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [27] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses accuracy and performance degradation of diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) under post-training quantization (PTQ) and presents DLLMQuant, a specialized framework to improve quantization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efforts to optimize diffusion-based large language models through post-training quantization face challenges such as accuracy drops and poor generalization due to unique features of DLLMs.

Method: The proposed DLLMQuant framework consists of three techniques: Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling (TMAS), Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), and Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), each tailored to specific characteristics of DLLMs.

Result: DLLMQuant achieves notable performance improvements and efficiency enhancements while mitigating the issues of amplification of quantization errors, mismatch of token distributions, and incompatibility in feature distributions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that specific adaptations in quantization can effectively address the unique challenges presented by DLLMs and improve their practical usability.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMReview, a benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on their review capabilities for academic papers across multiple disciplines and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a unified evaluation benchmark for assessing the ability of LLMs to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned reviews, particularly for multimodal content like figures and tables.

Method: The authors developed MMReview, a benchmark containing multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains. They implemented 13 tasks across four categories to evaluate the review generation performance of different models.

Result: Experiments on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models showed that MMReview provides a thorough evaluation framework for assessing LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: MMReview is a critical step toward establishing standardized benchmarks for developing automated peer review systems.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

### [29] [DPad: Efficient Diffusion Language Models with Suffix Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14148)
*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad) enhances diffusion-based LLMs’ efficiency and scalability by focused attention mechanisms, achieving significant speedups with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which suffer from high computational overhead by predicting all suffix tokens while only retaining few.

Method: Introduces Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), integrating a sliding window strategy for fixed-length suffix focus and distance-decay dropout to exclude distant tokens, reducing redundancy in attention computation.

Result: DPad achieves up to 61.4× speedup in decoding efficiency across benchmarks while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard dLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed DPad method offers an efficient, scalable solution for long-sequence inference in dLLMs, making it a practical alternative for computational optimization.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### [30] [Comparing energy consumption and accuracy in text classification inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14170)
*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the trade-offs between accuracy and energy consumption during text classification inference in LLMs, uncovering significant variability influenced by model type, size, and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses concerns about energy efficiency and sustainability in the inference phase of LLMs used in NLP tasks, an area that has received less attention than model training.

Method: The study conducts an empirical analysis of inference energy consumption and accuracy across various LLM architectures and hardware setups, examining correlations between runtime and energy usage.

Result: Findings reveal substantial variability in energy consumption and indicate that runtime can act as a practical proxy for energy use. Larger LLMs consume more energy but may have lower accuracy compared to smaller models.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights for balancing performance and sustainability in NLP applications, benefiting researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking efficiency in AI implementations.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

### [31] [Let's Use ChatGPT To Write Our Paper! Benchmarking LLMs To Write the Introduction of a Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14273)
*Krishna Garg,Firoz Shaikh,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG) task to assess LLMs' ability to generate research paper introductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-quality research paper introductions is challenging but crucial, especially as LLMs are increasingly used as writing assistants.

Method: The authors curate datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR 2025 papers and evaluate five LLMs using automated metrics and LLM-as-a-judge across multiple criteria, leveraging three-shot prompting.

Result: The study found that LLaMA-4 Maverick outperforms other models in metrics like semantic similarity and faithfulness. Three-shot prompting consistently led to better results.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for enhancing research writing assistants and stress the potential of LLMs in academic writing, while ensuring reproducibility through public release of code and datasets.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

### [32] [Disentangling concept semantics via multilingual averaging in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14275)
*Cliff O'Reilly,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes isolating semantic concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) using conceptual averaging across languages, improving interpretation of internal states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs’ shortcomings by separating semantics from syntax and language-specific bias.

Method: Use Sparse Autoencoders to derive concept activations from OWL ontology classes translated into multiple languages and calculate their average.

Result: The conceptual averages correlate strongly with true relationships between ontology classes, outperforming single-language activations.

Conclusion: The method enhances mechanistic interpretation of network states by isolating language-independent semantics.

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

*Adrian-Marius Dumitran,Alexandra-Mihaela Danila,Angela-Liliana Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRILE is a benchmark for assessing multilingual and Romanian-specific language models on Romanian grammar proficiency and explanatory accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the unclear pedagogical value of LLMs for low-resource languages like Romanian.

Method: The authors created the GRILE benchmark, consisting of 1,151 multiple-choice grammar questions sourced from Romanian exams, to evaluate the accuracy and explanatory quality of seven LLMs.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved 83% accuracy, but most models lag behind with less than 65% accuracy, and 48% of explanations in open-weight models are flawed.

Conclusion: GRILE highlights weaknesses in LLMs for Romanian grammar and paves the way for future research in educational NLP for low-resource languages.

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

### [34] [Tokens with Meaning: A Hybrid Tokenization Approach for NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14292)
*M. Ali Bayram,Ali Arda Fincan,Ahmet Semih Gümüş,Sercan Karakaş,Banu Diri,Savaş Yıldırım,Demircan Çelik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid tokenization framework combining rule-based morphological analysis and statistical segmentation, yielding improvements in token coherence and efficiency, especially for morphologically rich languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods struggle with agglutinative and morphologically rich languages because they rely on frequency-based heuristics rather than linguistic structure.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid framework employing phonological normalization, root-affix dictionaries, special tokens for whitespace/case, and BPE integration to balance morpheme preservation and vocabulary efficiency.

Result: The tokenizer achieved high linguistic coherence and efficiency, outperforming existing methods on the TR-MMLU benchmark for Turkish tokenization, with 90.29% Turkish Token Percentage and 85.8% Pure Token Percentage.

Conclusion: The method improves tokenization for morphologically rich languages and is adaptable to other languages, paving the way for more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multitask model for morphosyntactic parsing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in a shared task leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust system capable of predicting both morphological and syntactic analyses across a diverse set of languages using a unified model.

Method: The model employs a shared XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specific decoders targeting content word identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic features.

Result: The model achieved top performance in nine languages with metrics: 78.7% MSLAS, 80.1% LAS, and 90.3% Feats F1. Key factors for success included task-specific tokenization and word identification.

Conclusion: Matching gold tokenization and addressing struggles with grammatical cases and nominal features are essential to improving system accuracy further.

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

*Aman Goel,Daniel Schwartz,Yanjun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finch-Zk is a framework to detect and mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging cross-model consistency checks and targeted corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs showcase remarkable abilities across tasks but are prone to generating factual inaccuracies (hallucinations), posing a challenge for reliable deployment.

Method: Finch-Zk employs cross-model consistency checks using semantically-equivalent prompts for fine-grained hallucination detection, coupled with targeted content corrections.

Result: Experiments showed Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39% and mitigation accuracy by 7-8% when applied to advanced LLMs.

Conclusion: Finch-Zk is an effective and practical approach for enhancing factual accuracy and reliability in production-level LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

*Jing Chen,Zhiheng Yang,Yixian Shen,Jie Liu,Adam Belloum,Chrysa Papagainni,Paola Grosso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurveyGen-I is a framework for generating scientific survey papers using advanced retrieval, planning, and memory-guided generation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automatic survey generation using Large Language Models struggle with maintaining coherence and providing comprehensive citation coverage.

Method: SurveyGen-I employs coarse-to-fine retrieval, adaptive planning, and a memory mechanism to ensure coherence and enhance citation coverage in survey generation.

Result: Experiments in four scientific domains showed SurveyGen-I outperforms prior methods in content quality, consistency, and citation coverage.

Conclusion: SurveyGen-I improves the automation of scientific survey generation with better coherence, citation coverage, and overall quality, paving the way for more effective integration of LLMs in this task.

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

*Yixin Chen,Ying Xiong,Shangyu Wu,Yufei Cui,Xue Liu,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel system to improve the accuracy of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) in function calls using a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR) for more consistent demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-augmented LLMs frequently face inefficiencies due to erroneous function calls, making existing solutions costly and unreliable.

Method: The paper introduces BAR trained on a custom corpus through contrastive learning with dual-negative contrastive loss to reinforce consistency in demonstration-based prompting.

Result: The proposed system reduces incorrect function calls while preserving high task performance, demonstrating both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: BAR-enhanced demonstration methods provide a practical solution to improving tool-augmented LLMs, enhancing precision and reducing resource overhead.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for controlled, standardized conversational systems for qualitative data collection and quantitative analysis.

Method: Development of a non-generative conversational agent platform with an online administrative panel for customization, validated with two case studies on different topics.

Result: The system supports flexible interview creation without coding and is demonstrated in two real-life applications: COVID-19 expressive interviews and public opinion on neurotechnology.

Conclusion: This low-compute, customizable system is effective for structured conversational data collection and is provided as open-source to encourage further development.

Abstract: We present a low-compute non-generative system for implementing
interview-style conversational agents which can be used to facilitate
qualitative data collection through controlled interactions and quantitative
analysis. Use cases include applications to tracking attitude formation or
behavior change, where control or standardization over the conversational flow
is desired. We show how our system can be easily adjusted through an online
administrative panel to create new interviews, making the tool accessible
without coding. Two case studies are presented as example applications, one
regarding the Expressive Interviewing system for COVID-19 and the other a
semi-structured interview to survey public opinion on emerging neurotechnology.
Our code is open-source, allowing others to build off of our work and develop

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZPD-SCA, a benchmark for assessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the difficulty of Chinese reading materials across student developmental stages. Results show LLMs need improvement in educational alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient exploration of LLMs in assessing the cognitive alignment of reading materials with student developmental stages, especially for Chinese language education, which is vital for adhering to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) principles.

Method: The authors developed the ZPD-SCA benchmark, annotated by 60 Special Grade teachers, to evaluate Chinese reading comprehension difficulty. LLMs were tested in zero-shot and in-context scenarios to measure their effectiveness.

Result: LLMs performed poorly in zero-shot scenarios but improved significantly with in-context examples. However, even the best-performing models showed systematic biases and struggled to align material difficulty with cognitive abilities.

Conclusion: The findings highlight LLMs' emerging abilities but also their limitations in educationally aligned judgments. ZPD-SCA serves as a crucial tool for evaluating and improving LLMs for educational purposes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

*Ke Fang,Tianyi Zhao,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel prompt-based calibration method to improve the confidence accuracy of LLMs by using a structured interaction loop inspired by the Credence Calibration Game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure that LLMs deployed in decision-critical areas provide confidence estimates that align accurately with their actual correctness.

Method: The authors propose a feedback-driven, game-inspired calibration framework where LLMs are guided to align their confidence to correctness using structured prompt interactions and natural language performance summaries.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in evaluation metrics when using the proposed framework across different LLMs and game configurations.

Conclusion: Game-based prompting is an effective strategy for calibrating LLMs, offering a dynamic and supervision-light alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

### [42] [DEPTH: Hallucination-Free Relation Extraction via Dependency-Aware Sentence Simplification and Two-tiered Hierarchical Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391)
*Yupei Yang,Fan Feng,Lin Yang,Wanxi Deng,Lin Qu,Biwei Huang,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEPTH, a relation extraction framework using dependency-aware sentence simplification and hierarchical refinement to improve the reliability and accuracy of large language models in knowledge graph construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current relation extraction methods struggle to reliably determine the existence of relations in complex sentences, leading to spurious predictions and noisy knowledge graphs, which DEPTH aims to address.

Method: DEPTH uses two stages: the Grounding module extracts relations via shortest dependency paths for minimal syntactic noise, and the Refinement module revises predictions holistically. It also includes causality-driven rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: DEPTH achieved a 17.2% average improvement in F1 score and reduced hallucination rates to 7.0% across six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DEPTH significantly improves the precision and reliability of relation extraction in language models, reducing noise in knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [43] [Cognitive Surgery: The Awakening of Implicit Territorial Awareness in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14408)
*Yinghan Zhou,Weifeng Zhu,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Zhengxian Wu,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discovers that large language models struggle with identifying self-generated texts singularly and proposes a novel framework, Cognitive Surgery, to address this issue. Using four modules, their approach significantly enhances authorship discrimination accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research shows that large language models can distinguish self-versus-other authored texts when presented pairwise but fail in individual text scenarios. The paper aims to understand and resolve this limitation.

Method: The study introduces Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a framework incorporating four modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship discrimination, and cognitive editing. This approach activates latent territorial awareness in models.

Result: Three models demonstrated improved authorship discrimination accuracy in individual scenarios after applying CoSur, achieving 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01% average accuracies.

Conclusion: Cognitive Surgery effectively unlocks latent recognition abilities in language models, addressing their struggle in distinguishing self- and other-generated texts under the Individual Presentation Paradigm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

*Wuyang Zhang,Yexin Tian,Xiandong Meng,Mengjie Wang,Junliang Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fine-tuning framework for large language models using knowledge graphs to enhance structured reasoning and semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address missing reasoning chains and insufficient semantic understanding of entities in large language models.

Method: Fine-tune language models by injecting knowledge graph information using graph neural networks and a fusion mechanism to integrate linguistic and structural knowledge.

Result: The proposed framework improves performance across tasks like entity recognition, question answering, and language generation, showcasing enhanced semantic consistency and reasoning.

Conclusion: Injecting structured graph information into language models strengthens their semantic reasoning abilities, making them more effective for tasks requiring complex entity-level understanding.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid language model optimized for reasoning tasks. It is faster and more accurate compared to models of similar size, thanks to architectural modifications and compression techniques, enabling efficient inference even on limited GPU resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for faster and more accurate reasoning models that are also computationally efficient for use on GPUs with limited memory.

Method: The hybrid Mamba-Transformer design incorporates Mamba-2 layers to replace most self-attention layers to boost inference speed. It pre-trains a large 12B parameter model, then compresses and distills it using the Minitron strategy for efficient inference.

Result: Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 matches or surpasses similar models in reasoning accuracy and achieves up to 6x faster inference speed on reasoning benchmarks with extended token lengths.

Conclusion: Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 demonstrates that it is possible to optimize reasoning models for both accuracy and speed, and its release potentially benefits a wide range of reasoning applications.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with
the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

### [47] [Reasoning is about giving reasons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14488)
*Krunal Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes identifying an intermediate representation, Representation of Logical Structure (RLS), to overcome current challenges in machine reasoning with natural language arguments. This approach improves reasoning, interpretability, and explanation generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with interpretability in reasoning tasks and lack flexibility to handle tasks like abduction or identifying contradictions. There is a need for a method to accurately understand and articulate logical structures in arguments.

Method: The authors propose the Representation of Logical Structure (RLS), an intermediate representation that identifies logical atoms in arguments and rules connecting them. This structure aids deterministic reasoning and explanation generation.

Result: The approach demonstrates high accuracy in extracting logical structures from three popular reasoning datasets, showcasing support for enhanced reasoning capabilities and explanation generation.

Conclusion: By leveraging RLS, the paper addresses limitations in natural language reasoning models, enabling more flexible, interpretable, and accurate reasoning across various tasks.

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoTale, a Danish and English emotional speech corpus, and validates it through predictive speech emotion recognition (SER) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of functional emotional speech corpora for smaller languages like Danish motivated the creation of EmoTale.

Method: The authors developed SER models using self-supervised speech model embeddings and the openSMILE feature extractor, applying these to the EmoTale corpus.

Result: The SER model achieved a 64.1% unweighted average recall (UAR) on EmoTale using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation.

Conclusion: The EmoTale corpus proves to be a valid and effective resource for emotional speech recognition, with modern embeddings outperforming traditional hand-crafted features.

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles variability in neural sign language production using enhanced Progressive Transformers with quaternion pose encoding and contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges stemming from high intra-class variability in signs caused by stylistic differences and signer morphology.

Method: It introduces pose encoding with quaternion space and geodesic loss alongside contrastive loss using gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity.

Result: The approach yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint and a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error.

Conclusion: Incorporating skeletal modeling and semantic contrastive objectives enhances Transformer-based models for neural sign language production.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of Southern Uzbek in natural language processing, despite its 5 million speakers and its distinctiveness from Northern Uzbek.

Method: The paper introduces a 997-sentence FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from various sources, a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy), and a post-processing technique for Arabic-script morphological boundaries.

Result: The post-processing technique for Arabic-script half-space characters improves morphological boundaries handling. Additionally, various resources and models for Southern Uzbek are created and shared.

Conclusion: The public release of datasets, tools, and models aims to support continued research and development in Southern Uzbek and other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present
new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence
FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web
sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a
post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which
improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools
are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other
low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuous sentiment scoring method using concept vector projection for nuanced sentiment analysis in literary texts, outperforming traditional tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentiment analysis tools struggle with literary texts due to figurative language, stylistic ambiguity, and sentiment evocation strategies, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: The authors developed a continuous sentiment scoring technique based on concept vector projection and trained it on multilingual literary data.

Result: The method demonstrated superior performance over existing tools in analyzing English and Danish texts, aligning well with human-rated sentiment distributions.

Conclusion: This approach enables more precise and detailed sentiment analysis and sentiment arc modeling in diverse literary contexts.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

TL;DR: This paper identifies limitations in large language models' (LLMs) in-context learning (ICL) when handling certain tasks and proposes a new method, scaled signed averaging (SSA), to overcome these weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in LLMs' in-context learning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving first-order quantifiers and linear functions.

Method: The study replaces the standard Softmax scoring function in attention mechanisms with scaled signed averaging (SSA) and evaluates its effectiveness on various tasks.

Result: SSA significantly enhances performance on target linguistic tasks and benchmarks, showing improvement over Softmax-based models.

Conclusion: Scaled signed averaging (SSA) is a promising alternative to Softmax in LLMs, addressing key limitations in their in-context learning and improving performance on critical language tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShizhenGPT, a multimodal large language model (LLM) designed specifically for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), addressing data scarcity and its multimodal nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnostics require multimodal sensory understanding and currently suffers from a lack of high-quality data. Conventional LLMs are ill-equipped to handle the sensory-driven modalities of TCM like visual, auditory, and physiological signals.

Method: To create ShizhenGPT, a large TCM-focused dataset was curated, consisting of 100GB+ text, 1.2M images, 200+ hours of audio, and physiological signals. The model was pretrained and instruction-tuned to enhance TCM multimodal reasoning. Evaluation involved national TCM exams and a benchmark for visual diagnosis.

Result: ShizhenGPT surpasses other comparable LLMs and even some larger proprietary models. It excels in TCM visual understanding and demonstrates enhanced multimodal perception across vision, sound, pulse, and smell.

Conclusion: The work advances multimodal diagnostics in TCM, setting the stage for holistic understanding with public datasets, models, and code to push research and applications forward in this specialized domain.

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks text-based recipe generation comparing fine-tuned GPT-2 models with traditional LSTM/RNN baselines, introducing targeted tokenization for precise comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve natural language generation for recipes and address limitations of generic tokenizers by preserving recipe-specific structures and numerical precision.

Method: Fine-tuned GPT-2 (large and small) was compared against LSTM/RNN baselines using a tokenization enhancement and evaluated across seven automatic metrics for fluency, coherence, semantic relevance, and diversity.

Result: GPT-2 large outperformed recurrent baselines, achieving significant improvements in semantic relevance (BERTScore F1: 0.92 vs 0.72) and reducing perplexity by 69.8%.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in factual accuracy and lays a foundation for integrating constraints and multi-modal inputs in recipe generation.

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

*Guangzhan Wang,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMTransplant, a novel data augmentation method using Large Language Models for generating diverse text variants while retaining core semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text augmentation methods like Back-translation focus on creating lexical variations with the same semantics. While LLMs improve augmentation, controlling output style and structure is difficult without precise prompts.

Method: The proposed LMTransplant method uses a two-step strategy: 'transplant-then-regenerate.' LLMs are used to expand the context with seed text, followed by regenerating diverse variants within this expanded context.

Result: LMTransplant outperforms existing text augmentation approaches across various tasks and shows exceptional scalability as the quantity of augmented data increases.

Conclusion: LMTransplant effectively leverages LLMs to create diverse, creative content-level text variations, outperforming traditional methods, and scales well for large-scale data.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

*Samir Abdaljalil,Erchin Serpedin,Khalid Qaraqe,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in multilingual natural language inference (NLI), showcasing that code-switching can enhance performance and regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and assess the reasoning capabilities of large language models in multilingual contexts, particularly their logical consistency and robustness across languages.

Method: A controlled framework for multilingual NLI was developed, which generates synthetic logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into diverse languages. Testing was conducted in both monolingual and code-switched languages.

Result: Code-switching does not degrade performance; in fact, it can enhance it due to translation-induced lexical variation acting as a regularization signal. Semantic preservation of translated pairs was confirmed via embedding-based similarity analyses and cross-lingual visualizations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have both potential and limitations in cross-lingual reasoning. Code-switching offers a promising approach for improving multilingual performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransLLM, a unified framework integrating spatiotemporal modeling with large language models (LLMs) to address challenges in urban transportation tasks like traffic forecasting and taxi dispatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban transportation systems face challenges in tasks requiring flexibility, generalizability, and numerical reasoning, which are inadequately tackled by either task-specific deep learning models or LLMs.

Method: The proposed TransLLM framework combines a spatiotemporal encoder, learnable prompt composition, and reinforcement-learning-driven dynamic personalization to interface structured spatiotemporal data with LLMs.

Result: TransLLM achieves superior performance across various datasets and tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in supervised and zero-shot settings and outperforming ten baseline models.

Conclusion: TransLLM offers a generalizable and flexible solution for diverse transportation domains by integrating spatiotemporal modeling with LLMs, achieving adaptable and accurate predictions.

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

### [58] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation vs. Long-Context Input for Clinical Reasoning over EHRs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14817)
*Skatje Myers,Dmitriy Dligach,Timothy A. Miller,Samantha Barr,Yanjun Gao,Matthew Churpek,Anoop Mayampurath,Majid Afshar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle lengthy clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs), showcasing RAG as an efficient solution compared to reliance on extended context windows of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs are lengthy and unstructured, challenging clinicians in navigating clinical data efficiently, necessitating advanced methods for extracting meaningful insights.

Method: The study implemented RAG-based approaches for three replicable clinical tasks: extracting imaging procedures, generating antibiotic usage timelines, and identifying key diagnoses, comparing it against recent clinical notes and full-context approaches using state-of-the-art large language models.

Result: RAG demonstrated comparable or superior performance to using recent notes and approached full-context capabilities, while reducing input token requirements.

Conclusion: RAG provides a competitive and efficient solution for dealing with unstructured EHR data, even as language models advance to handle longer texts.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

*Josh Barua,Seun Eisape,Kayo Yin,Alane Suhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies multilingual reasoning in large language models, examining how reasoning using English affects performance across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of using English as a pivot reasoning language and to explore how reasoning abilities transfer across different languages.

Method: The authors create translated reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 models, and evaluate their long chains-of-thought reasoning performance across multiple languages.

Result: English improves reasoning performance for Japanese and Latvian but is ineffective for Swahili. Multilingual pretraining reduces but does not fully eliminate performance gaps. Language-specific trade-offs emerge in dataset quality and size effectiveness.

Conclusion: Long chains-of-thought reasoning transfer across languages reveals varied benefits of using English as a pivot, highlights the need for language-specific approaches, and provides resources for multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with performing well in medical tasks due to limited dense knowledge for clinical reasoning and the lack of specialized medical retrieval tools.

Method: The authors develop a data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs to create multi-hop QA pairs and integrate a custom-built medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools. They also leverage supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for training.

Result: The MedResearcher-R1-32B model delivers exceptional performance with new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks, while still being competitive in general deep research tasks.

Conclusion: Strategic domain-specific innovations in model architecture, tools, and training data can enable smaller open-source models to outperform larger proprietary systems in specialized areas like medicine.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

TL;DR: This study investigates the quantization of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to address challenges in deploying them on edge devices, focusing on activation outliers and quantization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of dLLMs on edge devices, addressing their massive scale and resource demands by exploring post-training quantization (PTQ) methods.

Method: The paper identifies activation outliers in dLLMs and evaluates state-of-the-art PTQ methods across bit-widths, quantization approaches, task types, and model variants.

Result: Practical insights are derived from the evaluation, highlighting the challenges and potential solutions for low-bit quantization of dLLMs.

Conclusion: The systematic study lays groundwork for future research in efficient dLLM deployment, with released codes and setups aiding the community.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates positive sampling Kantorovich operators, focusing on their approximation and error properties, and their application in image analysis, with numerical demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the convergence properties and approximation behavior of SK operators, particularly in image processing where uneven image properties may affect operator performance.

Method: The study defines operators and derives the fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA). Error analysis includes investigating MSE, SI, SSI, SMPI, and ENL. Numerical examples are provided for different resolution levels and conditions.

Result: Distinct performance characteristics of each operator were observed, with varying suitability depending on image features and conditions (ideal vs. non-ideal). A Shepp-Logan Phantom example justifies FTA under practical purposes.

Conclusion: Different SK operators exhibit unique strengths and weaknesses based on image properties. Fully leveraging these requires careful selection of operators depending on specific image features or focus areas.

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a federated learning framework for pose-based human activity recognition (HAR) focused on industrial settings, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements while safeguarding privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for accurate and privacy-sensitive recognition of worker actions in industrial environments, leveraging the robustness of skeleton-based HAR.

Method: A federated learning framework was implemented using skeleton-based HAR data with eight industrial upper-body gestures, processed using the FastPose model and two temporal backbones (LSTM, Transformer), evaluated under centralized, local, and FL paradigms.

Result: The use of federated learning, particularly the FedEnsemble approach, achieved substantial accuracy improvements: up to +58.3 percentage points compared to centralized training on unseen external clients.

Conclusion: Federated learning is an effective and privacy-conscious solution for scalable skeleton-based HAR in diverse industrial environments, outperforming centralized methods significantly in cross-user generalization.

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LENS, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for text-prompted image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance generalization in text-prompted image segmentation by introducing chain-of-thought reasoning, which existing supervised methods overlook.

Method: The paper proposes LENS, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes both reasoning and segmentation processes with unified rewards spanning sentence, box, and segment-level cues.

Result: LENS, built on a 3-billion-parameter vision-language model, achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% across three benchmarks, outperforming previous strong methods by up to 5.6%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that RL-driven CoT reasoning improves generalization and reliability in text-prompted segmentation, paving the way for more versatile models.

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses scale variation challenges in computer vision and introduces the Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer (DEC) to improve model performance and local scale consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale variation, where objects of the same class appear in varying sizes due to distance and perspective, presents challenges for accurate and consistent computer vision tasks.

Method: The authors propose the Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer (DEC), which enhances local scale equivariance. DEC can be integrated into existing architectures and optimized for pre-trained models.

Result: DEC boosts performance and local scale consistency on the ImageNet benchmark across four pre-trained models: ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT.

Conclusion: DEC effectively addresses scale variation challenges, demonstrating versatility and improvement for deep-net architectures. The work emphasizes the importance of scale equivariance in computer vision.

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve symmetry detection in computer vision by leveraging CLIP, a pre-trained vision-language model, to incorporate semantic cues from image descriptions.

Method: The paper introduces CLIPSym, which uses CLIP's pre-trained encoders, a rotation-equivariant decoder with Transformer and $G$-Convolution, and a Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG) technique to optimize symmetry detection.

Result: CLIPSym achieves state-of-the-art results on three established symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, LDRS) and demonstrates the advantages of integrating CLIP's pre-training, the equivariant decoder, and SAPG.

Conclusion: The study concludes that utilizing CLIP's vision-language capabilities, combined with novel decoding techniques, significantly enhances symmetry detection performance, offering promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle complex data structures in image classification by leveraging graph-based representations and GCNs' ability to model relational data.

Method: Introduced a novel GCN-based framework that represents images as graphs (with pixels/regions as vertices), further simplified using Delaunay triangulations, and proposed the Normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN).

Result: NVGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in scenarios with complex scenes and fine-grained categories, achieving better classification accuracy and faster pre-processing time on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams shows significant potential for improving image classification and opens up opportunities for graph-based learning in broader domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new learning mechanism to enhance the robustness and generalization of large multimodal models (LMMs) by solving shuffle-related tasks during pre-training and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the impressive performance of LMMs, they face issues with robustness and generalization due to misalignment between visual and textual features.

Method: The authors introduce tasks involving reconstructing image and text order during model training, use a directed-token approach for better multimodal knowledge capture, and propose an Image-to-Response Guided loss for stronger visual understanding.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple LMM benchmarks, showcasing improved visual understanding, reasoning, and cross-modality alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions provide a simple yet effective way to address the robustness and generalization problems in LMMs, significantly improving their task performance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Motivation: To address the lack of reliable uncertainty quantification in deep learning models for critical medical tasks, such as diabetic retinopathy grading.

Method: Analyzed the effects of five data augmentation strategies on two deep learning models—ResNet-50 and CoaT—using the DDR dataset, focusing on conformal prediction metrics.

Result: Sample-mixing augmentations (Mixup and CutMix) improved accuracy and uncertainty reliability, while CLAHE negatively affected model certainty.

Conclusion: Augmentation strategies should be carefully designed with uncertainty quantification in mind to ensure trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

*Said Djafar Said,Torkan Gholamalizadeh,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new conditional diffusion model for generating anatomically realistic 3D dental CBCT scans with control over tooth presence and configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge in medical image synthesis of generating precise, anatomically realistic 3D dental scans with fine-grained control over tooth-level features.

Method: The proposed framework combines wavelet-based denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions. It uses tooth-level binary attributes for localized dentition control.

Result: The model achieves strong fidelity, generalizability, and robustness in tasks like tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis, with low FID scores and SSIM values exceeding 0.91 on unseen scans.

Conclusion: This work provides a new tool for realistic and localized modification of dental scans, supporting surgical planning, patient communication, and data augmentation for AI purposes.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GALA introduces a framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding using 3D Gaussian Splatting, with features supporting fine-grained semantic embeddings and efficient memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained, language-aware 3D representations from 2D images, triggering the need for enhanced techniques.

Method: GALA leverages self-supervised contrastive learning to create a 3D instance feature field and employs a cross-attention design with learnable codebooks for generalized language feature fields.

Result: GALA achieves strong open-vocabulary performance in both 2D and 3D scene understanding, as shown through experiments with real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The design ensures effective intra-instance feature similarity and language understanding while optimizing memory consumption, marking a step forward in 3D scene comprehension.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

### [74] [Multi-Rationale Explainable Object Recognition via Contrastive Conditional Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14280)
*Ali Rasekh,Sepehr Kazemi Ranjbar,Simon Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for explainable object recognition tasks using multi-rationale datasets instead of relying on single, noisy rationales, and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for explainable object recognition depend on prompts and limited datasets with single rationales, leading to insufficient explanatory structures and noisy rationale generation.

Method: The proposed Contrastive Conditional Inference (CCI) framework models the relationships between image embeddings, labels, and rationales probabilistically, ensuring effective conditioning without requiring additional training.

Result: The CCI framework performs remarkably well on the multi-rationale benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy and rationale quality, including zero-shot robust results.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new benchmark for effective and explainable object recognition by achieving high performance in both label accuracy and rationale diversity, paving the way for further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

TL;DR: OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model integrating YOLOX and temporal attention mechanisms, automates vascular occlusion detection in DSA sequences for acute ischemic stroke diagnosis with high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately and quickly detecting vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy is critical for treating acute ischemic stroke, but traditional analysis of digital subtraction angiography images poses challenges.

Method: OccluNet combines YOLOX, an object detection model, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to analyze DSA sequences for vascular occlusions. Two variants of attention mechanisms were compared: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention.

Result: OccluNet demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving precision of 89.02% and recall of 74.87%, effectively capturing temporally consistent features.

Conclusion: OccluNet is a promising solution for automated occlusion detection in complex anatomical DSA sequences, offering improved performance and aiding in faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

TL;DR: Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1) is a foundation model for learning human-like gameplay in 3D video games using end-to-end behavior cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address emerging use cases like AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, and assistive testers, a model is needed that learns gameplay through pixel streams and generalizes across games without extensive engineering.

Method: P2P0.1 uses behavior cloning with both labeled human gameplay demonstrations and unlabeled public videos. Actions for unlabeled videos are inferred via an inverse-dynamics model and processed by an auto-regressive decoder-only transformer.

Result: The model demonstrates competent gameplay abilities in Roblox and MS-DOS games, with supporting ablations on the use of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Future scaling and evaluation will focus on achieving expert-level, text-conditioned control using minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

*Guile Wu,David Huang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified approach for multi-modal, multi-view video generation in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of separate RGB and depth/semantic video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of separate video generation models that fail to leverage complementary cues for multi-modal autonomous driving scenes.

Method: A unified diffusion transformer model integrating modal-shared and modal-specific components, using diverse conditioning inputs to ensure controllable scene structure and content cues.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate high fidelity and controllability in generated multi-modal urban scene videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework enables efficient and high-quality multi-modal video generation, enhancing video synthesis capabilities for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [78] [Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an inter-class relational loss function to address gradient update inefficiencies for small objects in one-stage multi-object detection tasks. It uses spatial relationships between objects to improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based losses fail to correctly update gradients for small objects, leading to insufficient learning during multi-object detection tasks.

Method: The inter-class relational loss penalizes incorrect spatial relationships between objects, leveraging larger objects to guide the predictions of smaller ones.

Result: The proposed loss function improved detection performance, boosting mAP metrics by 10.3% for YOLOv12-T and 1.6% for UAV-DETR.

Conclusion: The inter-class relational loss enhances small object detection without additional hyperparameter tuning, showing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a publicly available microscopy image dataset for studying cellular responses to Taxol and proposes a baseline model, ResAttention-KNN, for automating Taxol concentration classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detection methods for monitoring Taxol’s cellular effects are cost-heavy, labor-intensive, and not suited for high-throughput or real-time analyses.

Method: They developed a ResAttention-KNN model combining ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for effective Taxol concentration analysis.

Result: The proposed method integrates advanced techniques for classification and is validated using the newly introduced dataset.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a novel dataset and effective model that enhance the robustness and interpretability of cellular morphology analysis, supporting future biomedical research.

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

*Zhujun Li,Shuo Zhang,Ioannis Stamos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRC-Pose is a depth-only framework improving category-level object pose estimation using contrastive learning to enhance pose continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture the intrinsic continuity of 6D poses, leading to inconsistencies and poor generalization.

Method: HRC-Pose decouples the pose into rotation and translation components. It uses contrastive learning with a hierarchical ranking scheme to process point clouds, factoring in rotational, translational, and categorical differences.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art depth-only approaches on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks, with real-time capability.

Conclusion: HRC-Pose demonstrates improved prediction consistency and pose generalization for real-world applications.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for generating emotion-controllable talking face videos, emphasizing a discretely learned multimodal embedding and token generation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of modeling multimodal relationships related to emotions and synthesizing identity-preserving emotional speaking-face videos.

Method: The method uses audio disentanglement and video quantization through pre-training, introduces emotion-anchor (EA) representations for emotion integration, and employs an autoregressive transformer to predict visual token sequences for synthesized videos.

Result: The proposed method effectively synthesizes identity-preserving emotional talking face videos, as demonstrated by experiments on the MEAD dataset, showing qualitative and quantitative improvements.

Conclusion: The novel discrete multimodal approach is effective for emotion-controllable talking face generation with enhanced video synthesis quality.

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOT systems primarily focus on pedestrians and struggle to generalize across object categories, particularly vehicles in complex traffic scenarios.

Method: The framework includes an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism and a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy using semantic scene priors. Additionally, a new vehicle-focused tracking dataset is introduced.

Result: The method achieves robust tracking performance on the new dataset and several existing benchmarks, notably attaining HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong generalized tracking capabilities across object classes, outstanding performance on conventional benchmarks, and contributes valuable datasets and code.

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

*Runshi Zhang,Bimeng Jie,Yang He,Junchen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Transformer-based methodology named TCFNet for orthognathic surgical simulation, addressing limitations like inefficiency and lack of precision in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based approaches for face-bone shape transformations face issues like noisy points, pre-/post-processing complexity, and limitations with large-scale point clouds.

Method: TCFNet utilizes a novel coarse-to-fine approach: a Transformer-based network for global features and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) to model local geometry.

Result: TCFNet demonstrates superior evaluation metrics and visualization results against current SOTA methods on collected datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances processing precision and efficiency in surgical simulations, offering practical improvements and releasing supportive open-source code for the research community.

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

TL;DR: The paper presents QuadINR, a hardware-efficient Implicit Neural Representation (INR) method using piecewise quadratic activation functions for better performance and reduced hardware overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spectral bias and high hardware costs associated with traditional activation functions in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs).

Method: QuadINR leverages piecewise quadratic activation functions, which exhibit rich harmonic content to capture high-frequency signals efficiently. A unified $N$-stage pipeline framework was implemented for hardware efficiency.

Result: QuadINR demonstrated up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement, achieved a 97% reduction in resource and power consumption, and decreased latency by up to 93% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: QuadINR offers a substantial enhancement in performance and hardware efficiency, making it a promising alternative for high-frequency signal processing in INRs on FPGA and ASIC platforms.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Img2ST-Net, a fully convolutional AI framework that generates high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data directly from histology images, addressing computational challenges and inefficiencies of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and high computational demands of generating spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, especially at increasingly high resolutions, making the process more accessible and efficient.

Method: The proposed Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional neural network to perform parallel prediction of high-resolution ST data. It innovatively models the data as super-pixel representations and incorporates SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric for better accuracy under sparse expression patterns.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalability, efficiency, and biological coherence in predicting high-resolution ST data, providing dense, gene expression maps. It successfully addresses inefficiencies and computational challenges of traditional methods.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net establishes a robust, scalable, and resolution-aware platform for generating high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data using histological images, paving the way for next-generation ST modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

### [87] [CTA-Flux: Integrating Chinese Cultural Semantics into High-Quality English Text-to-Image Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14405)
*Yue Gong,Shanyuan Liu,Liuzhuozheng Li,Jian Zhu,Bo Cheng,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Yuhang Ma,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CTA-Flux is an adaptation method for aligning Chinese text inputs with Flux, a text-to-image generative model primarily trained on English. It enhances cultural authenticity and visual realism for Chinese prompts without extensive model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux, a leading text-to-image generative model, suffers from diminished performance when processing non-English inputs due to biases within English-centric datasets. Existing solutions fail to resolve issues surrounding culturally nuanced semantics, thus prompting the development of a more efficient adaptation method.

Method: CTA-Flux employs the MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to directly control the Flux backbone, minimizing parameter needs while improving understanding of Chinese semantics. This design avoids retraining the entire model and ensures compatibility with popular plugins like LoRA, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet.

Result: Empirical evaluations reveal that CTA-Flux handles both Chinese and English prompts effectively, producing high-quality images characterized by enhanced visual realism and accurate representation of Chinese semantics.

Conclusion: The CTA-Flux framework innovatively bridges linguistic and cultural gaps in the Flux model, offering an improved and resource-effective solution for non-English text prompts, particularly for Chinese users, while maintaining community plugin compatibility.

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

### [88] [MoCHA-former: Moiré-Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer for Video Demoiréing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14423)
*Jeahun Sung,Changhyun Roh,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of moiré patterns in screen-captured media with a novel method called Moiré Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former), achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing demoiréing techniques in handling spatially varying artifact strength, large-scale structures, channel-dependent statistics, and temporal fluctuations in screen-captured photos and videos.

Method: The authors propose Moiré Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former) built with two components: Decoupled Moiré Adaptive Demoiréing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoiréing (STAD). DMAD separates moiré and content for targeted restoration, while STAD improves spatial and temporal consistency by leveraging specialized attention mechanisms.

Result: MoCHA-former is evaluated on two video datasets in RAW and sRGB domains, where it significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed MoCHA-former effectively addresses the challenges of demoiréing by combining spatial, temporal, and channel-adaptive techniques, paving the way for more consistent and high-quality media capture.

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

*Bing Han,Yuhua Huang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperDiff, a novel method for monocular 3D human pose estimation that integrates diffusion models to handle data uncertainty and HyperGCN to model joint correlations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in monocular 3D human pose estimation, such as depth ambiguity, occlusion, and underutilized skeleton structure information, which hinder pose estimation accuracy.

Method: The method combines diffusion models to capture data uncertainty and alleviate depth ambiguity, with HyperGCN to model high-order joint correlations and denoise multi-granularity structures for improved pose estimation.

Result: HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, demonstrating adaptability to computational resource constraints while balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed HyperDiff method effectively addresses depth ambiguity and occlusion issues in monocular 3D pose estimation, leveraging advanced modeling techniques to improve accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Hong-Gi Shin,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for enhancing controllable text-based 3D motion generation using residual vector quantization (RVQ) for improved expressiveness and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to overcome the limitations of pose code-based representations in text-to-motion generation, which struggle with capturing fine-grained motion details.

Method: The authors proposed augmenting pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion features through residual vector quantization (RVQ).

Result: Their model achieves state-of-the-art metrics, reducing FID from 0.041 to 0.015 and slightly improving Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510 on the HumanML3D dataset.

Conclusion: The approach preserves pose code interpretability while capturing detailed motion characteristics, improving motion generation quality and controllability.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

### [91] [FOCUS: Frequency-Optimized Conditioning of DiffUSion Models for mitigating catastrophic forgetting during Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14437)
*Gabriel Tjio,Jie Zhang,Xulei Yang,Yun Xing,Nhat Chung,Xiaofeng Cao,Ivor W. Tsang,Chee Keong Kwoh,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOCUS, a novel frequency-conditioning approach to test-time adaptation using a diffusion-driven framework, addressing catastrophic forgetting during domain adaptation in semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing the tradeoff between preserving task-relevant knowledge and adapting to domain shifts is difficult, as adapting can lead to forgetting important information.

Method: FOCUS employs frequency-based conditioning within a diffusion process. It uses a lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) trained with FrequencyMix (a data augmentation technique) to handle high and low frequencies. This approach helps preserve semantic information while improving robustness.

Result: FOCUS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation tasks across multiple datasets and corruption types. It also enhances existing model adaptation methods by mitigating forgetting through pseudo-label-based supervision.

Conclusion: FOCUS is effective at preserving semantic knowledge during domain adaptation and is computationally efficient, supporting its utility in various tasks and complementing other adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

### [92] [Fusing Monocular RGB Images with AIS Data to Create a 6D Pose Estimation Dataset for Marine Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14767)
*Fabian Holst,Emre Gülsoylu,Simone Frintrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a technique to generate 6D pose estimation data for marine vessels using fusing monocular RGB images with AIS data, bypassing issues of AIS-only reliance. It evaluates detection models and transformation methods, introducing a publicly available BONK-pose dataset containing annotated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations with AIS-reliant vessel location data caused by equipment reliability, manipulation, and delay issues, while aiming to create a more accurate pose estimation system without manual annotations.

Method: The technique uses YOLOX-X for object detection and fuses RGB images with AIS data. Two transformation methods are compared—homography and Perspective-n-Point (PnP)—to align AIS data with image coordinates.

Result: The PnP method significantly reduces projection error compared to homography, and YOLOX-X model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at 0.5 IoU for vessels.

Conclusion: The approach enables automatic generation of 6D pose estimation datasets, demonstrated by the BONK-pose dataset, which facilitates further research in vessel pose estimation without requiring labor-intensive manual annotation.

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

TL;DR: MUSE addresses layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis by combining spatial accuracy and identity preservation using concatenated cross-attention and a progressive two-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the challenge of integrating spatial control and identity preservation for multi-subject synthesis in text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: MUSE introduces a concatenated cross-attention mechanism for aligning spatial constraints and text descriptions, combined with a progressive two-stage training strategy for optimized synthesis.

Result: MUSE demonstrates superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency in zero-shot end-to-end generation, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The MUSE framework represents a significant advancement in controllable image synthesis, effectively bridging the gap between layout control and subject preservation.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Method: Development of the Virtual Community platform, built on a universal physics engine grounded in real-world 3D environments, including open-source simulation tools, a community generation pipeline, and tasks evaluating multi-agent collaboration.

Result: The platform supports multi-agent simulations, introduces two novel challenges (Community Planning and Robot Challenges), and highlights current limitations in task planning and cooperation through baseline evaluations.

Conclusion: Virtual Community facilitates research on the dynamics of human-robot coexistence, offering a foundational tool for studying intelligent interactions and promoting advancements in open-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Motivation: Limited exploration of 3D Gaussian Splatting in agriculture, combined with challenges like uneven illumination, occlusions, and restricted field of view.

Method: Introduced NIRPlant dataset with multimodal data (NIR, RGB, depth, LiDAR, metadata) and proposed NIRSplat architecture using cross-attention and 3D positional encoding for robust agricultural 3D reconstruction.

Result: NIRSplat achieves superior performance compared to landmark methods such as 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat, particularly in complex agricultural environments.

Conclusion: Utilizing multimodal data and advanced architectural techniques, NIRSplat provides an effective solution for agricultural 3D reconstruction, addressing key challenges.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms

TL;DR: DAPA is a novel framework for conversational engagement modeling focused on domain generalizability and interaction dynamics, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A better system for estimating engagement in human-computer interaction is needed, as existing methods struggle to generalize well across diverse domains and handle complex interaction dynamics.

Method: DAPA uses a domain-specific prompting mechanism for adaptive learning and a cross-attention module to align forward and backward interaction states between participants.

Result: DAPA outperforms prior methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art, including a 0.45 CCC improvement on the NoXi-J dataset and winning first place in an engagement estimation challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed DAPA framework significantly improves engagement estimation across diverse and challenging datasets, establishing it as a robust method for real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

TL;DR: The paper introduces D^3-Talker, a 3D talking head synthesis method that improves lip synchronization and image quality with limited training data using Gaussian attribute fields and novel contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D talking head synthesis methods struggle with poor lip synchronization and image quality when trained on limited data. This research aims to address these challenges by improving audio-lip mapping and rendering fidelity.

Method: D^3-Talker employs static and deformation Gaussian attribute fields, decouples audio and facial motion control, introduces contrastive loss during pre-training, and refines images via a Coarse-to-Fine module.

Result: Experiments show D^3-Talker surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in realism and synchronization quality while requiring minimal training frames.

Conclusion: D^3-Talker successfully advances 3D talking head synthesis by solving key challenges, offering improved performance metrics and practical applications with less data dependency.

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Ouroboros introduces a unified diffusion model framework for handling forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement, achieving state-of-the-art performance and faster inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address cycle inconsistency and slow inference in current multi-step diffusion models for rendering tasks.

Method: Developed Ouroboros, consisting of two single-step diffusion models with intrinsic decomposition for indoor/outdoor scenes and cycle consistency mechanism.

Result: Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes and faster inference speed compared to other diffusion methods; also showcased training-free video decomposition.

Conclusion: The approach both improves rendering coherence and inference efficiency, with successful application to video sequences and reduced temporal inconsistency.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while

### [99] [DreamSwapV: Mask-guided Subject Swapping for Any Customized Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14465)
*Weitao Wang,Zichen Wang,Hongdeng Shen,Yulei Lu,Xirui Fan,Suhui Wu,Jun Zhang,Haoqian Wang,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DreamSwapV, an innovative end-to-end framework for subject swapping in videos, focusing on customization and high fidelity using mask-guided and reference image-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations in subject swapping for video editing, a field seeing increased demand but restricted by domain-specific methods and indirect paradigms.

Method: DreamSwapV employs a mask-guided approach with multiple conditions and a condition fusion module alongside an adaptive mask strategy. It adopts a two-phase dataset construction and tailored training scheme.

Result: Experiments on VBench indicators and the custom DreamSwapV-Benchmark demonstrate that DreamSwapV achieves superior fidelity and flexibility in subject swapping compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DreamSwapV proves effective as an end-to-end, subject-agnostic framework, advancing video editing capabilities by enabling high-quality subject swapping across diverse contexts.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

*Boxiao Pan,Adam W. Harley,C. Karen Liu,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of predicting future 6D head trajectories from egocentric video, introducing a dataset and model that learns human-like navigation behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable better navigation systems and active information-gathering through prediction of future head movements in applications like robotics, AR/VR, and assistive technologies.

Method: The authors propose a framework leveraging temporally aggregated 3D latent features to model environmental constraints. They also introduce a new dataset called Aria Navigation Dataset (AND) collected via Project Aria glasses.

Result: The proposed model successfully learns human-like navigation behaviors and can generalize to unseen environments, showcasing behaviors such as waiting, rerouting, and looking for traffic.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates progress in egocentric navigation prediction, providing both a practical dataset and a robust model to encourage advancements in this field.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen
environments. Check out our project webpage at

*Haoran Bai,Xiaoxu Chen,Canqian Yang,Zongyao He,Sibin Deng,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vivid-VR, a video restoration method based on a DiT-based T2V foundation model, employs ControlNet and concept distillation to ensure content consistency, texture realism, and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve video restoration by addressing challenges of texture realism and temporal coherence caused by distribution drift in conventional controllable pipelines.

Method: Vivid-VR uses a concept distillation training strategy and introduces a redesigned control architecture. The architecture includes a control feature projector to reduce degradation artifacts and a dual-branch ControlNet connector for improved content preservation and adaptive control.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Vivid-VR's superior performance over existing methods on synthetic, real-world, and AI-generated content, achieving high texture realism, vividness, and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Vivid-VR provides a notable advancement in video restoration by combining foundational generative models with controllable mechanisms, ensuring consistent and high-quality results.

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATURN enhances text-to-image generation by integrating scene graph structural information, reducing FID and boosting Inception Score significantly compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with layout and object relationships. Prior graph-guided models are slower and less accurate compared to autoregressive approaches, prompting SATURN's development.

Method: SATURN uses scene graphs converted into salience-ordered token sequences, enabling structural interpretation by adapting VAR-CLIP while leveraging CLIP-VQ-VAE. Fine-tuning focuses only on the VAR transformer.

Result: SATURN demonstrates substantial performance improvements on the Visual Genome dataset, including FID reduction (56.45% to 21.62%) and Inception Score increase (16.03 to 24.78), surpassing SG2IM and SGDiff.

Conclusion: SATURN successfully merges structural scene graph information with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity, improving layout, object count, and spatial relations without complex modules or training setups.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PB-IAD, a framework using foundation models for anomaly detection in manufacturing, addressing dynamic production challenges such as data sparsity and user-centered flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more adaptable and user-centric approach for industrial anomaly detection that overcomes the limitations of traditional methods reliant on annotated datasets.

Method: The framework, PB-IAD, employs foundation models and includes a prompt template, a preprocessing module, and semantic instructions. It allows customization through domain-specific user inputs without requiring data science expertise.

Result: PB-IAD demonstrated superior anomaly detection performance in data-sparse and low-shot manufacturing scenarios compared to methods like PatchCore.

Conclusion: Foundation models, integrated with user-centric features, can significantly enhance anomaly detection in dynamic manufacturing settings, offering adaptability and high performance even with limited data.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenGE is a framework aiming to generate diverse and adversarial safety-critical traffic scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current rule-based and predefined strategies for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles, which fail to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes.

Method: ScenGE uses two stages: Meta-Scenario Generation with large language models to infer plausible adversarial agents, and Complex Scenario Evolution to amplify threats through optimized vehicle interactions.

Result: Experiments show ScenGE generates more severe collision cases (+31.96%) compared to existing methods, improves model robustness through adversarial training, and is validated by real-world and human evaluations.

Conclusion: ScenGE enhances safety scenario testing for autonomous vehicles, ensuring plausibility and criticality while improving public trust and safety deployment.

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WISE-FUSE, an adaptive encoding framework that reduces computational costs for whole slide image (WSI) processing in pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSIs used in computational pathology are extremely large, making encoding and processing expensive and time-consuming, which hinders real-world applicability.

Method: WISE-FUSE employs a combination of vision-language models and large language models to identify diagnostically important areas from low-resolution patches, drastically reducing the number of high-resolution patches needed for encoding.

Result: WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while maintaining or improving diagnostic performance compared to exhaustive methods.

Conclusion: This framework presents a scalable and efficient approach for WSI processing, offering significant computational savings without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method to improve OCR system performance by exploiting character redundancy in documents via extended GMM clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR systems struggle with recognizing low-quality and highly variable inter-domain printed documents, lacking the ability to leverage within-document redundancy.

Method: The proposed method uses an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), alternating Expectation-Maximization (EM) with intra-cluster realignment and normality statistical testing.

Result: The approach demonstrates better recognition performance on degraded documents, including Uruguayan military archives and 17th to 20th century European newspapers.

Conclusion: Leveraging character redundancy within documents via unsupervised clustering can effectively enhance OCR output quality for challenging datasets.

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss

APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help

*Sujin Jeon,Hyundo Lee,Eungseo Kim,Sanghack Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) rely on human-understandable visual cues for prediction, but suffer from localization issues when using foundation models without direct annotations. The proposed Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM) improves spatial localization by integrating prototype learning and foundation model information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving concept localization in CBMs, especially when dense concept annotations are unavailable and foundation models are utilized.

Method: LCBM uses prototype learning, assigning prototypes to represent prototypical image features of concepts. It enhances spatial localization by encouraging prototypes to encode relevant local regions with the help of foundation models.

Result: LCBM shows improved concept identification and localization while maintaining classification performance, as demonstrated experimentally.

Conclusion: LCBM is an effective solution to address localization issues in CBMs using label-free approaches, making it more accurate in predicting concept presence and relevant locations in images.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

*Xingyuan Yang,Min Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GOGS, a two-stage framework for more efficient and accurate inverse rendering of glossy objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in inverse rendering methods, especially in handling specular reflections, multi-view inconsistencies, surface artifacts, and inaccurate material property estimation.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework (GOGS). The first stage involves robust surface reconstruction using physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation and geometric priors. The second stage focuses on material decomposition using Monte Carlo importance sampling and differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing.

Result: GOGS demonstrates superior geometry reconstruction, accurate material separation, and high-quality photorealistic relighting under various novel illumination conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses existing limitations, offering an efficient and effective solution for inverse rendering, significantly improving upon current approaches.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Conclusion: The combination of TUMTraf-A dataset and Accid3nD model provides valuable resources for traffic safety research and accident detection. Both are shared publicly, promoting further research in the domain.

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety
of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be
understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We
present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of
real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at
high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and
track IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and
LiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the
OpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that
combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HistAug, a generative model designed for efficient and controllable data augmentation in digital pathology, improving performance in MIL-based slide-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models in digital pathology, compounded by challenges like gigapixel resolution of WSIs and limited supervision, motivates the development of more effective data augmentation methods.

Method: The proposed method, HistAug, generates realistic augmented embeddings in the latent space while maintaining semantic integrity. It works by conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations and enables efficient processing of patches via a single forward pass.

Result: HistAug demonstrated consistent performance improvements in MIL tasks across multiple organs, particularly excelling in low-data scenarios. Ablation studies confirmed the advantages of learned transformations over noise-based methods.

Conclusion: HistAug offers a fast, controllable, and scalable augmentation technique that enhances MIL model robustness, especially when dealing with small datasets, and represents a step forward in digital pathology.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

*Nitish Kumar Mahala,Muzammil Khan,Pushpendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust smoke detection framework using monocular imagery and a novel segmentation dataset, addressing challenges in traditional detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire outbreaks endanger human lives and infrastructure, necessitating reliable systems that overcome illumination, kinematics, and noise challenges.

Method: A novel framework integrates monocular imagery-based smoke feature extractions with a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer and Gaussian Mixture Model on optical flow maps.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior generalization and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, proving reliable for applications like surveillance and industrial safety.

Conclusion: This framework offers a reliable solution for early smoke detection, improving trustworthiness and resilience in critical application areas.

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes visual prompt-based methods for incremental object detection (IOD) and finds a promising combination of visual prompts with small-data replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the application of visual prompt-based methods from incremental learning (IL) for image classification to the domain of incremental object detection (IOD).

Method: The study examines three prompt-based methods under domain-incremental learning and compares them with various reference baselines. Additionally, it evaluates configurations like prompt length and initialization.

Result: While prompt-based approaches alone underperform in IOD, incorporating a small replay of previous data boosts effectiveness, achieving superior results.

Conclusion: Combining visual prompts with data replay is a practical and effective strategy for advancing incremental learning in object detection settings.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

### [115] [UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604)
*Peiming Li,Ziyi Wang,Yulin Yuan,Hong Liu,Xiangming Meng,Junsong Yuan,Mengyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM) for human action recognition in point cloud videos, addressing spatio-temporal disorder using methods like STSS, STSA, and TIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud videos struggle with spatio-temporal disorder when modeled into 1D sequences, affecting human action recognition performance.

Method: The UST-SSM leverages Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA), and Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) for semantic-aware reorganization, feature aggregation, and fine-grained temporal interaction.

Result: Experiments on three datasets—MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D—demonstrate the superiority of UST-SSM.

Conclusion: UST-SSM effectively addresses spatio-temporal modeling challenges in point cloud videos, enhancing human action recognition. The code is open-source.

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMTrack, a directly-trained deep Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework for multi-object tracking (MOT) using conventional RGB videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored application of SNNs in complex temporal tasks like MOT, especially with standard RGB video streams.

Method: Proposes SMTrack framework with an Adaptive Scale-Aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) and a Track identity module to enhance detection, localization, and trajectory consistency.

Result: SMTrack achieves comparable performance to leading Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in MOT tasks, validated across multiple datasets including BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of directly-trained SNNs for robust and accurate multi-object tracking in complex video scenarios, pushing the boundaries of SNN applicability.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: AnchorSync is a diffusion-based framework for editing long videos by focusing on sparse anchor frame editing and seamless intermediate interpolation, resulting in higher visual and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video editing is challenging due to the need to avoid issues like structural drift and temporal artifacts, which are common in existing methods for extended sequences.

Method: AnchorSync utilizes a novel diffusion-based framework that separates editing into two tasks: sparse anchor frame editing and smooth intermediate frame interpolation, achieved through progressive denoising and multimodal guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync achieves superior visual quality and improved temporal stability over prior methods.

Conclusion: AnchorSync offers a robust solution for consistent and coherent long video editing, addressing major limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerSense and its improved version, PerSense++, as training-free frameworks for personalized segmentation in dense images, addressing occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in segmenting dense visual scenes including occlusions, background clutter, and scale variation.

Method: The authors propose PerSense, which utilizes a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM), a Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM), and a feedback mechanism. PerSense++ incorporates enhanced strategies such as diversity-aware exemplar selection, a hybrid IDM, and an Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module (IMRM).

Result: PerSense++ demonstrates improved performance and robustness in segmenting dense visual scenes across multiple established benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks, PerSense and PerSense++, effectively advance the task of personalized segmentation in dense images and outperform existing methods in this area.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

### [119] [GeMS: Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Extreme Motion Blur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14682)
*Gopi Raju Matta,Trisha Reddypalli,Vemunuri Divya Madhuri,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS is a new framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that directly reconstructs scenes from extremely blurred images, outperforming existing methods by leveraging innovative techniques in pose estimation, point cloud generation, and event-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle to handle extreme motion blur due to reliance on sharp images or reliable feature correspondences, which are often unavailable under severe blur.

Method: GeMS integrates VGGSfM for pose estimation from blurred images, 3DGS-MCMC for probabilistic scene initialization, joint optimization for stable reconstruction, and GeMS-E introduces event-based deblurring for refinement.

Result: GeMS and GeMS-E achieved state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively addressing extreme motion blur.

Conclusion: The GeMS framework is groundbreaking as it successfully addresses the limitations of current methods and advances 3DGS reconstruction directly from severely blurred inputs.

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

### [120] [Seeing Further on the Shoulders of Giants: Knowledge Inheritance for Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14707)
*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model-driven approach to train vision foundation models (VFMs) by combining pre-trained teacher models to address data scarcity and computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of developing vision foundation models (VFMs) that typically require large-scale labeled data and high-end computational resources, which are not accessible to many institutions.

Method: The authors propose a method that unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models into a shared latent space for balanced knowledge transfer and introduces a knowledge preservation strategy using adapter modules.

Result: Their approach results in a VFM that inherits expertise from teacher models without relying on vast labeled datasets, achieving superior performance across diverse vision tasks.

Conclusion: The study validates that unifying domain-specific teacher models enables the development of a general-purpose VFM with transferable and high-quality visual features, outperforming traditional data-centric methods.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

TL;DR: GSFix3D combines the generative ability of diffusion models with 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve rendering quality for extreme novel viewpoints and under-constrained regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with generating high-quality renderings for challenging novel viewpoints and partially observed scenarios, while diffusion models lack scene-specific reconstruction capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces GSFix3D, leveraging diffusion model fine-tuning (GSFixer) and random mask augmentation for repairing unseen camera poses and inpainting missing areas.

Result: GSFix3D and GSFixer achieve state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for challenging benchmarks, minimizing required scene-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GSFix3D effectively addresses limitations in novel view synthesis and reconstruction tasks, showing resilience to pose errors and promising real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper presents a multiscale video transformer for real-time unknown object detection using motion cues, without relying on optical flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ensuring safety in autonomous systems that must detect unknown objects and handle unforeseen scenarios efficiently.

Method: Develops a multiscale video transformer with multi-stage query-memory decoding and random drop-token for class-agnostic segmentation that doesn't use optical flow.

Result: Shows higher efficiency and accuracy than baseline methods on datasets like DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes while being GPU and runtime efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances real-time dense prediction for autonomous systems, balancing accuracy and efficiency using a memory-centric design.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new dataset and a lightweight neural network for RAW image illumination and sensor mapping to address challenges in capturing RAW datasets for deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW image datasets are difficult to capture for deep learning due to the sensor- and illumination-specific nature of RAW images. This complicates the process of collecting data for multiple sensors and illumination conditions.

Method: The authors propose a dataset captured using a customized lightbox allowing precise control over illumination spectra. They create a dataset comprising 390 illuminations, four cameras, and 18 scenes. Additionally, they introduce a lightweight neural network approach for illumination and sensor mapping.

Result: The lightweight neural network introduced in the paper outperforms competing methods. The dataset and model enable improved performance in tasks like training neural ISPs.

Conclusion: This work provides both a novel dataset as well as a robust neural network for addressing RAW image illumination and sensor mapping challenges, significantly easing data collection efforts and improving downstream applications.

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

*Zhichao Li,Arren Glover,Chiara Bartolozzi,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining event cameras with RGB cameras to achieve precise real-time 6-DoF pose tracking of high-speed objects by leveraging both sensor advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed object tracking in robotics faces challenges due to conventional camera limitations such as motion blur and frame rate restrictions.

Method: The authors propose merging event-based optical flow for object motion measurement with RGB-based global pose estimation to track objects' 6-DoF pose effectively. The framework integrates velocity tracking from event cameras with low-frequency pose estimation.

Result: Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the method's effectiveness, particularly for high-speed objects.

Conclusion: Fusing event cameras with RGB-based pose estimation enhances real-time 6-DoF pose tracking without compromise, offering a novel solution for robotics applications at high speeds.

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

*Mengliang Zhang,Jacob M. Luber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a technique to reduce domain bias in pathology foundation models caused by hospital-specific image differences, improving disease classification performance in unseen hospital scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain biases stemming from hospital-specific image characteristics threaten the clinical reliability of pathology foundation models.

Method: A lightweight adversarial framework is introduced, combining a trainable adapter, a domain classifier, and a gradient reversal layer (GRL) to generate domain-invariant yet task-discriminative representations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate reduced domain predictability and improved disease classification, especially for out-of-domain data, validated through hospital detection tests and feature space analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates hospital-specific biases without altering pretrained encoders, offering substantial benefits for robust clinical deployment.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

*Kihyun Na,Junseok Oh,Youngkwan Cho,Bumjin Kim,Sungmin Cho,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MF-LPR$^2$, a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition method, to address challenges like low resolution, motion blur, and glare in dash cam images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve license plate recognition under challenging conditions such as low resolution, motion blur, and glare, as existing methods fail to restore poor-quality images accurately and often introduce artifacts.

Method: The proposed framework uses a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator with specialized algorithms to align and aggregate consecutive frames, correcting erroneous flow estimations and leveraging spatio-temporal consistency.

Result: MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, with a 86.44% recognition accuracy, surpassing single-frame (14.04%) and multi-frame (82.55%) baselines, as tested on their newly created RLPR dataset.

Conclusion: The MF-LPR$^2$ framework effectively enhances both image restoration and recognition accuracy, offering a reliable solution for real-world license plate recognition from low-quality images.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

### [127] [DINOv3 with Test-Time Training for Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14809)
*Shansong Wang,Mojtaba Safari,Mingzhe Hu,Qiang Li,Chih-Wei Chang,Richard LJ Qiu,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free method for medical image registration using a DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization. It shows promising results on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of requiring large amounts of training data for medical image registration to enable broader clinical adoption.

Method: Employs a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization to refine deformation fields in feature space, eliminating the need for training.

Result: Achieved the best accuracy metrics (DSC, HD95) and improved deformation regularity (SDLogJ) on Abdomen MR-CT and ACDC cardiac MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Using foundation feature spaces for registration at test time can serve as an effective, training-free approach suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

### [128] [Tinker: Diffusion's Gift to 3D--Multi-View Consistent Editing From Sparse Inputs without Per-Scene Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14811)
*Canyu Zhao,Xiaoman Li,Tianjian Feng,Zhiyue Zhao,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework called Tinker enables high-fidelity 3D editing without per-scene training, using pretrained diffusion models for multi-view consistency and minimal input images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-fidelity 3D editing techniques require extensive per-scene optimization, making scalable editing challenging.

Method: Tinker employs pretrained diffusion models and introduces two components: a multi-view editor for coherent edits and a video synthesizer for scene completion.

Result: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art results in 3D editing tasks, including rendering enhancement and novel-view generation from sparse inputs.

Conclusion: Tinker significantly advances generalizable 3D editing by eliminating complex optimization requirements and lowering input data barriers.

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

### [129] [Repeating Words for Video-Language Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14812)
*Haoyu Zhao,Jiaxi Gu,Shicong Wang,Xing Zhang,Hang Xu,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework that enhances video-language retrieval by utilizing fine-grained features for better alignment and an inference pipeline to boost performance without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video-language retrieval face high computational costs due to large-scale pre-training and underutilize fine-grained video-text details.

Method: The approach employs coarse-to-fine objectives, a Granularity-Aware Representation module for fine-grained data extraction, and incorporates a novel inference pipeline with a voting mechanism and Matching Entropy metric.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show superior performance over existing methods, with significant improvements in Recall@1 on MSR-VTT (+2.1%) and DiDeMo (+1.6%) datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently improves video-language retrieval accuracy while reducing training costs, utilizing fine-grained feature learning and an effective inference strategy.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

*Zongming Li,Lianghui Zhu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransLight proposes a new method for transferring complex light effects between images, improving customization and fidelity compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methods that simultaneously allow custom control of light effects while maintaining content integrity for practical lighting stylization.

Method: Generative Decoupling using fine-tuned diffusion models to separate content and light effects, creating a large dataset of triplets, and employing IC-Light for modeling with additional conditioning signals.

Result: TransLight successfully enables high-fidelity transfer of diverse light effects while providing flexible illumination control, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: TransLight charts new directions in illumination harmonization and editing by enabling the transfer of complex light effects with high customization and natural integration.

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation using event cameras to achieve low latency and low compute demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of performing road segmentation for autonomous vehicles with low latency and low computational requirements, particularly focusing on leveraging event cameras instead of frame-based cameras.

Method: The proposed EventSSEG uses event-only computing combined with a probabilistic attention mechanism and self-supervised learning to handle the scarcity of labeled event camera data.

Result: EventSSEG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 datasets, requiring minimal labeled events.

Conclusion: EventSSEG effectively utilizes the capabilities of event cameras for road segmentation, offering a solution to the labeled data scarcity while maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates pancreas morphology changes across different ages and their deviation in type 2 diabetes using AI methods on CT and MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect deviations in pancreas morphology caused by type 2 diabetes and establish normative aging trends to improve diagnostics.

Method: Analyzed data from 2533 patients using automated pancreas segmentation on CT and MRI scans, comparing 13 morphology features and utilizing GAMLSS regression for aging trends.

Result: Identified significant differences in 10 of 13 features between diabetic and non-diabetic patients and found MRI measurements differ from CT using their AI method.

Conclusion: The pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes, and the study provides reference data for non-diabetic pancreas morphology changes across the lifespan.

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

*Mert Kiray,Alvaro Ritter,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MS-CLR, a contrastive learning framework for action recognition that leverages multiple skeleton conventions, improving generalization and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition are limited to single skeleton conventions, restricting generalization across datasets with diverse joint structures.

Method: The authors propose MS-CLR, a self-supervised framework that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions and adapts the ST-GCN architecture to handle diverse skeleton layouts and scales.

Result: MS-CLR demonstrates consistent performance improvements over single-skeleton baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions allows MS-CLR to learn robust, expressive features, leading to better generalization and improved skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

*Licheng Shen,Saining Zhang,Honghan Li,Peilin Yang,Zihao Huang,Zongzheng Zhang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified representation for reconstructing articulated objects that combines geometry and motion using 3D Gaussians, improving scalability and robustness for objects with complex articulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior methods that decouple geometry reconstruction and motion estimation, complicating scalability and performance for objects with multi-part articulation.

Method: Introduced a unified representation using articulated 3D Gaussians to simultaneously model geometry and motion and proposed MPArt-90, a benchmark of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories for systematic evaluation.

Result: The method showed superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation, supporting objects with up to 20 parts. It outperformed prior approaches in scalability, robustness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified representation enables scalable and robust reconstruction of articulated objects, applicable to various tasks like robotic simulation and human-scene interaction modeling.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

*Kushagra Agrawal,Polat Goktas,Anjan Bandopadhyay,Debolina Ghosh,Junali Jasmine Jena,Mahendra Kumar Gourisaria*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in IoT resource allocation with a novel framework that optimizes multiple objectives such as cost, QoS, energy efficiency, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT ecosystems require efficient and fair resource allocation mechanisms to address the limitations of centralized and single-objective auction models.

Method: The proposed MOHAF uses hierarchical clustering for complexity reduction, a submodular optimization strategy, and a dynamic pricing mechanism to achieve balanced outcomes.

Result: MOHAF exhibits superior allocation efficiency (0.263) and perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000) compared to baseline methods in experiments with Google Cluster Data.

Conclusion: MOHAF is a scalable and robust solution for IoT resource allocation, successfully balancing efficiency, equity, and sustainability across large-scale deployments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the
challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic,
distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and
single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost
minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system
performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction
Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly
optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness.
MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity
with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e)
approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to
resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality.
Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553
requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency
(0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101)
auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation
studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining
balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical
guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and
adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling
efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.

*Saswata Jana,Subhajit Pramanick,Adri Bhattacharya,Partha Sarathi Mandal*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the deployment of autonomous luminous robots with limited visibility to solve the minimal vertex cover (MVC) problem in connected graphs, achieving efficient solutions for specific graph classes like trees and general graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether autonomous robots with finite visibility and local knowledge can achieve a defined task, specifically forming a minimal vertex cover in graphs, which has practical implications and is computationally challenging.

Method: The authors use local-interaction myopic robots under an asynchronous scheduler. They propose algorithms for trees (single and multiple doors) and general graphs, establishing visibility range bounds, time complexity, and leveraging extra memory for robots.

Result: For trees, they achieve memory and time-optimal algorithms and solve the minimum vertex cover (MinVC) with a single door. For general graphs, they present efficient algorithms for single and multiple doors that run in O(|E|) epochs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of solving the minimal vertex cover problem using myopic robots for specific graph classes and provides theoretical bounds and optimal algorithms, expanding understanding of autonomous robot capabilities in graph tasks.

Abstract: In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility,
it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices
satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper
affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite
visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal
vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special
vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially.
Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of
vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous
($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the
\emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for
general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We
establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time
complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one
for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for
multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the
number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on
trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present
two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors
with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'pure data' as a new foundation for mathematics and computing, emphasizing finite sequences over logic or type theory. Within this system, spaces, viewed as associative data collections, are studied through their semiring of endomorphisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To propose a new foundational framework for mathematics and computing that prioritizes 'pure data' (finite sequences) over traditional logic and type-based foundations, enabling new insights and exploration.

Method: The authors develop a theory of 'spaces,' associative data collections analogous to sets or objects in existing mathematical frameworks. These spaces are explored through their semiring of endomorphisms, and classical mathematical constructs are reconstructed from this foundation.

Result: The framework naturally produces familiar mathematical constructs, such as natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and even more complex entities like quaternions and non-associative algebras.

Conclusion: The 'pure data' approach demonstrates potential for reexamining classical mathematics and exploring new theoretical directions, showcasing its robustness as a foundational framework.

Abstract: In a previous work, "pure data" is proposed as an axiomatic foundation for
mathematics and computing, based on "finite sequence" as the foundational
concept rather than based on logic or type. Within this framework, objects with
mathematical meaning are "data" and collections of mathematical objects must
then be associative data, called a "space." A space is then the basic
collection in this framework analogous to sets in Set Theory or objects in
Category Theory. A theory of spaces is developed,where spaces are studied via
their semiring of endomorphisms. To illustrate these concepts, and as a way of
exploring the implications of the framework, pure data spaces are "grown
organically" from the substrate of pure data with minimal combinatoric
definitions. Familiar objects from classical mathematics emerge this way,
including natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, boolean spaces, matrix
algebras, Gaussian Integers, Quaternions, and non-associative algebras like the
Integer Octonions. Insights from these examples are discussed with a view
towards new directions in theory and new exploration.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSSP-Del, a distributed algorithm for dynamic Single-Source Shortest Path problems that handles edge insertions and deletions in large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies of recomputing SSSP trees after topology changes in large, dynamic graphs and the limitations of existing methods in distributed memory settings.

Method: Developed SSSP-Del, a vertex-centric, asynchronous algorithm that operates in a shared-nothing architecture and handles streams of edge insertions and deletions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows low latency, stable solutions, and high throughput on large real-world and synthetic graphs.

Conclusion: SSSP-Del offers an efficient, scalable approach to dynamic SSSP in distributed memory, addressing edge additions, deletions, and performance challenges concurrently.

Abstract: Modern graphs are both large and dynamic, presenting significant challenges
for fundamental queries, such as the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
problem. Naively recomputing the SSSP tree after each topology change is
prohibitively expensive, causing on-demand computation to suffer from high
latency. Existing dynamic SSSP algorithms often cannot simultaneously handle
both edge additions and deletions, operate in distributed memory, and provide
low-latency query results. To address these challenges, this paper presents
SSSP-Del, a new vertex-centric, asynchronous, and fully distributed algorithm
for dynamic SSSP. Operating in a shared-nothing architecture, our algorithm
processes streams of both edge insertions and deletions. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on large real-world and synthetic graphs with millions
of vertices, and provide a thorough analysis by evaluating result latency,
solution stability, and throughput.

### [139] [A Hierarchical Sharded Blockchain Balancing Performance and Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14457)
*Yongrae Jo,Chanik Park*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded blockchain that balances performance and availability by utilizing local and main chain structures with DAG-based consensus methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current blockchain sharding techniques improve performance but often compromise data availability, leading to challenges under server failures.

Method: PyloChain combines local chains for speculative parallel transaction execution and a DAG-based main chain for efficient global transaction consensus. A scheduling mechanism reduces aborted transactions, and auditing ensures reliability.

Result: PyloChain outperforms comparable systems, achieving 1.49x higher throughput and 2.63x lower latency during evaluations.

Conclusion: PyloChain successfully addresses the scalability and availability tradeoff in blockchain systems by integrating hierarchical sharding and efficient transaction handling mechanisms.

Abstract: Blockchain networks offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability
for managing critical data but encounter scalability problems as the number of
network members and transaction issuers grows. Sharding is considered a
promising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing
blockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of
availability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data
unavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded
blockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of
multiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local
chain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism
across multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph
(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable
efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or
cross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively
executes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high
parallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,
PyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions
in the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to
mitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to
lower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,
demonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and
2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical
sharded blockchain.

*Hagit Attiya,Antonio Fernández Anta,Alessia Milani,Alexandre Rapetti,Corentin Travers*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper extends auditability from single-writer registers to other shared objects, providing efficient implementations and studying their properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To give data owners greater control over shared data by tracking operations and access to information, thereby extending auditability beyond single-writer registers.

Method: Introduced an auditable n-writer m-reader read/write register using (m+n)-sliding registers with O(n+m) step complexity, demonstrating that the consensus number of m+n is necessary. This was further applied to LL/SC shared objects and related access control mechanisms.

Result: Achieved efficient implementations for multi-writer registers and LL/SC primitives, and demonstrated how auditable registers can support other access control objects like deny lists.

Conclusion: Auditability for shared objects enhances access control and enables efficient implementations for complex operations, paving the way for broader applicability.

Abstract: Auditability allows to track operations performed on a shared object,
recording who accessed which information. This gives data owners more control
on their data. Initially studied in the context of single-writer registers,
this work extends the notion of auditability to other shared objects, and
studies their properties.
  We start by moving from single-writer to multi-writer registers, and provide
an implementation of an auditable $n$-writer $m$-reader read / write register,
with $O(n+m)$ step complexity. This implementation uses $(m+n)$-sliding
registers, which have consensus number $m+n$. We show that this consensus
number is necessary. The implementation extends naturally to support an
auditable load-linked / store-conditional (LL/SC) shared object. LL/SC is a
primitive that supports efficient implementation of many shared objects.
Finally, we relate auditable registers to other access control objects, by
implementing an anti-flickering deny list from auditable registers.

TL;DR: The paper addresses PCN topology optimization to minimize costs associated with channel creation, augmentation, and transaction rejection. It proposes algorithms with theoretical guarantees and empirical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address blockchain scalability issues by optimizing Payment Channel Network (PCN) topology and decision-making to maximize transaction throughput and minimize costs.

Method: The authors designed $
O(p)$ and $
O(\sqrt{p})$ approximation algorithms for solving the PCN optimization problem and applied theoretical and empirical analyses, focusing on the Lightning Network.

Result: They provided an $
O(p)$ and a potentially improved $
O(\sqrt{p})$ approximation algorithm, along with validation through theoretical insights and empirical testing.

Conclusion: Efficient algorithms for PCN topology design can minimize costs and improve transaction compatibility, demonstrating practical relevance in systems like the Lightning Network.

Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates
blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to
the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to
maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also
have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to
reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an
input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a
transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected
(entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$
cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a
decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating
and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our
main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the
problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the
distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an
empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning
Network.

*Kathleen West,Youssef Moawad,Fabian Lehmann,Vasilis Bountris,Ulf Leser,Yehia Elkhatib,Lauritz Thamsen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study addresses the carbon emissions of scientific workflows and demonstrates the benefits of carbon-aware computing, reducing emissions significantly through temporal shifting and resource scaling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific workflows consume substantial energy and result in notable carbon emissions due to their long-running nature, presenting the need for exploring carbon-reduction strategies in this domain.

Method: The study estimates carbon emissions of seven real-world workflows using carbon intensity data, evaluates temporal shifting, pausing/resuming, and resource scaling strategies to quantify their impact on carbon reduction.

Result: Temporal shifting can reduce carbon emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling can cut emissions by 67%, demonstrating the potential of carbon-aware execution methods.

Conclusion: Carbon-aware workflow strategies like temporal shifting and resource scaling present substantial opportunities to mitigate the carbon footprint of scientific workflows, making them more environmentally sustainable.

Abstract: Scientific workflows are widely used to automate scientific data analysis and
often involve computationally intensive processing of large datasets on compute
clusters. As such, their execution tends to be long-running and
resource-intensive, resulting in substantial energy consumption and, depending
on the energy mix, carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware
computing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically
on scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for
carbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant,
efficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous. In this
study, we first exemplify the problem of carbon emissions associated with
running scientific workflows, and then show the potential for carbon-aware
workflow execution. For this, we estimate the carbon footprint of seven
real-world Nextflow workflows executed on different cluster infrastructures
using both average and marginal carbon intensity data. Furthermore, we
systematically evaluate the impact of carbon-aware temporal shifting, and the
pausing and resuming of the workflow. Moreover, we apply resource scaling to
workflows and workflow tasks. Finally, we report the potential reduction in
overall carbon emissions, with temporal shifting capable of decreasing
emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling capable of decreasing emissions by
67%.

### [145] [The Cost Advantage of Virtual Machine Migrations: Empirical Insights into Amazon's EC2 Marketspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14883)
*Benedikt Pittl,Werner Mach,Erich Schikuta*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper examines cost-optimal strategies for constructing cloud portfolios using pricing data from Amazon and a dataset from Bitbrains datacenter. It suggests cost savings can be achieved by creating heterogeneous portfolios and migrating virtual machines between marketspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need to optimize cloud portfolios in a market where multiple pricing models and marketspaces exist for purchasing virtual machines.

Method: The researchers conducted a cost analysis using Amazon cloud pricing data and virtual machine utilization data from the Bitbrains datacenter. They validated findings with a secondary dataset from Bitbrains in a different application domain.

Result: The findings reveal that cost-optimal portfolios involve purchasing virtual machines from different marketspaces and that savings can also be achieved through migrations during runtime. Additionally, many virtual machine resources are underutilized, highlighting potential for cost efficiency.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous cloud portfolios and runtime migrations are key to cost optimization, and there is substantial room to exploit underutilized virtual machine resources in cloud computing.

Abstract: In recent years, cloud providers have introduced novel approaches for trading
virtual machines. For example, Virtustream introduced so-called muVMs to charge
cloud computing resources while other providers such as Google, Microsoft, or
Amazon re-invented their marketspaces. Today, the market leader Amazon runs six
marketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of
virtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces
and providers. An industry-relevant field of research is to identify best
practices and guidelines on how such optimal portfolios are created. In the
paper at hand, a cost analysis of cloud portfolios is presented. Therefore,
pricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization
dataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can
only be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines
are purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of
migrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is
presented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines
of cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year. The paper further
shows that most of the resources of virtual machines are never utilized by
consumers, which represents a significant future potential for cost
optimization. For the validation of the results, a second dataset of the
Bitbrains datacenter was used, which contains utility data of virtual machines
from a different domain of application.

### [146] [STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Brent ByungHoon Kang,Hyeongboo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAS, a framework for Spiking neural networks (SNNs) in vision transformers, achieving energy efficiency and accuracy through architectural and computational enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient but struggle with high latency and computational overhead. Current solutions are fragmented and fail to address core challenges in applying adaptive computation principles to spiking transformers.

Method: The STAS framework incorporates an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module for unified input representation and an adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module for token pruning across spatial and temporal axes.

Result: Applied to spiking Transformer architectures and tested on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while improving accuracy over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: STAS effectively addresses the challenges of applying adaptive computation principles to SNN-based vision transformers while achieving substantial improvements in energy efficiency and model accuracy.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

*Pablo G. Almeida,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Pedro Silva,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores whether converting student tabular data into graph structures enhances dropout prediction accuracy using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Student dropout poses social and economic challenges, and accurate prediction can enable preventive interventions. Current machine learning models operate mainly on tabular data, but GNNs offer the ability to capture complex relationships inherent in graph-structured data.

Method: The study converts tabular student data into graph structures using clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, UMAP). It evaluates the performance of GNNs (Graph Convolutional Network and GraphSAGE) against tabular models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, TabNet) on student dropout prediction.

Result: GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering outperformed other models, improving macro F1-score by ~7 percentage points and accuracy by ~2 points over XGBoost. However, other GNN configurations did not consistently outperform tabular methods.

Conclusion: While GNNs demonstrate potential for dropout prediction, optimal graph generation strategies and GNN architecture choices are critical for success. Careful design is necessary to leverage the strengths of graph-based learning in this context.

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study deals with handling sparsity in datasets, specifically using Gaussian interpolation for a 62% sparse power plant load dataset, concluding that LSTM models perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by sparsity in real-life datasets, particularly in load forecasting for power plants.

Method: The authors use Gaussian interpolation to make a 62% sparse dataset suitable for Wide Sense Stationary (WSS) analysis and test various machine learning and deep learning models, including LSTM.

Result: The study finds that Gaussian interpolation is effective for handling sparsity, and LSTM-based neural network models achieve the best forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Gaussian interpolation can effectively deal with sparsity in power plant load forecasting data, and LSTM models are the most reliable modeling choice.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of efficiently solving Vehicle Routing Problems, which are critical for logistics and transportation, by proposing mechanisms that improve solution quality and scalability.

Method: Two learning-based mechanisms are developed for edge solution selection: (1) a tabular binary classifier using Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Networks, and (2) a Graph Neural Network leveraging graph structure to predict prohibited moves during local search.

Result: The hybrid mechanisms improve the performance of state-of-the-art metaheuristics across different VRP types and sizes, including CVRP and CVRPTW, as validated by experiments on benchmark datasets involving up to 30,000 nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scalability, generalizability, and accuracy in solving VRPs, marking significant progress in managing large-scale routing problems efficiently.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCLPD, a semi-supervised learning framework, to enhance EEG-based Parkinson’s disease detection across datasets using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in EEG-based Parkinson's disease detection, such as limited labeled dataset size, acquisition protocol differences, and subject demographic disparities.

Method: The proposed MCLPD framework employs multi-view contrastive pre-training on an unlabeled dataset (UNM) and lightweight supervised fine-tuning with a small percentage of labeled datasets (UI and UC). Dual augmentations in time and frequency domains enrich the dataset and combine time-frequency information.

Result: MCLPD achieved substantial F1 scores of 0.91 (UI) and 0.81 (UC) with only 1% labeled data, and further improved to 0.97 (UI) and 0.87 (UC) with 5%. It outperforms existing methods in cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: MCLPD enhances the robustness and generalizability of EEG-based Parkinson's disease detection models while reducing dependency on labeled data, showcasing its practicality and efficiency.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's disease detection methods struggle with variability in EEG datasets and limited dataset sizes, making it hard to train a generalizable model for cross-dataset application.

Method: The paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, GEPD, which includes a generative network creating quality EEG data and a classification network combining multiple convolutional neural networks to capture time-frequency EEG characteristics effectively.

Conclusion: GEPD successfully addresses challenges in EEG-based Parkinson's disease detection across datasets, showing promise in the accurate classification and monitoring of neurological conditions.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual

datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art

TL;DR: The paper proposes Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL), a method aimed at improving generalization and uncertainty quantification in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of poor generalization performance and expensive memory/computation costs in existing fine-tuning methods for LLMs.

Method: The authors adapt amortized Bayesian meta-learning to LLMs by reframing task-specific and global parameters in the LoRA framework, introducing hyperparameters to balance accuracy and fidelity.

Result: ABMLL demonstrates superior accuracy and calibration compared to existing approaches when tested on Unified-QA and CrossFit benchmarks.

Conclusion: ABMLL provides an efficient way to fine-tune LLMs with improved generalization and uncertainty quantification, scaling effectively to large models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical convergence properties of score-based graph generative models (SGGMs), analyzing errors and proposing insights for designing effective models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGGMs are vital for applications like drug discovery, but their convergence behavior is poorly understood due to complexities in coupled stochastic equations.

Method: The paper analyzes convergence bounds for three SGGMs paradigms, studies influencing factors, and offers guidelines such as hyperparameter selection and normalization.

Result: Theoretical predictions align with controlled empirical studies, confirming unique convergence factors and validating approaches to improve model performance.

Conclusion: The work advances theoretical knowledge of SGGMs, confirms their practical effectiveness, and provides optimization strategies for modeling.

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

*Mengdi Li,Guanqiao Chen,Xufeng Zhao,Haochen Wen,Shu Yang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PersRM-R1, a personalized reward modeling framework designed to capture user preferences with limited data using a two-stage training pipeline combining synthetic data generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models for language models struggle to handle nuanced, user-specific preferences, especially with limited data or diverse domains.

Method: The paper combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: PersRM-R1 outperforms similarly sized models and matches the performance of much larger models in accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: PersRM-R1 contributes to the development of more effective personalized language models, addressing challenges in limited-data scenarios and user-specific customization.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

### [158] [Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14615)
*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two statistical methods to test for the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) in similarity choice data and finds significant IIA violations in the datasets tested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Similarity choices are widely used but rarely analyzed for their violations of IIA, which limits their accurate modeling in contexts like information retrieval and embedding learning.

Method: The paper develops two methods: a goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian approach via Posterior Predictive Checks, alongside curated datasets to evaluate IIA violations.

Result: The proposed tests consistently detect significant IIA violations, and these are comparable across both designed and randomly generated datasets.

Conclusion: Context effects within choice sets are primarily responsible for IIA violations, urging the development of models that better capture these interactions.

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines label smoothing in machine learning through the lens of the information bottleneck framework, finding it to be an optimal and practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical foundations of label smoothing and its connection to the information bottleneck framework.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis under specific assumptions with experimental validation to assess label smoothing as an information bottleneck method.

Result: Label smoothing achieves the properties predicted by the information bottleneck, such as optimal exploration of outputs and insensitivity to irrelevant factors.

Conclusion: Label smoothing serves as a practical and effective implementation of the information bottleneck, suggesting broader implications for machine learning regularization techniques.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

*Mohamed Hassan Abdalla Idris,Jakub Marek Cebula,Jebraeel Gholinezhad,Shamsul Masum,Hongjie Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel machine learning framework combining domain-specific techniques and uncertainty quantification to enhance hydrocarbon production forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of robust out-of-sample prediction for hydrocarbon production using multivariate time series data and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Integrates Productivity Index-driven feature selection with Inductive Conformal Prediction to build and test ML models including LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and XGBoost on historical oil field data.

Result: The LSTM model showed the best performance with minimal error metrics (MAE of 19.468 and 29.638 for test and future forecasts, respectively) and robust uncertainty intervals.

Conclusion: Combining domain-specific engineering concepts with advanced ML methods significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasting.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

*Maxime Heuillet,Rishika Bhagwatkar,Jonas Ngnawé,Yann Pequignot,Alexandre Larouche,Christian Gagné,Irina Rish,Ola Ahmad,Audrey Durand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of robust fine-tuning design choices on generalization performance across multiple datasets and testing scenarios. It presents the most comprehensive benchmark for robust fine-tuning, providing insights into architecture and pretraining strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for images are highly sensitive to small perturbations, and improving robustness without training from scratch has become a critical area of study.

Method: A large empirical study tests various design choices for robust fine-tuning, including architecture types, pretrained representations, loss objectives, and adaptation protocols, across diverse datasets and perturbations.

Result: Convolutional neural networks pretrained on large datasets in supervised fashion often outperform attention-based architectures in robust generalization tasks.

Conclusion: The study challenges prevailing assumptions about robustness design, suggesting CNNs remain highly effective while providing data-driven insights and practical recommendations for future research.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

*Guanghao Jin,Jingpei Wu,Tianpei Guo,Yiyi Niu,Weidong Zhou,Guoyang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KnowDR-REC, a new benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), to address limitations in earlier models by requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning, providing robust negative samples, and offering novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inadequacies of traditional REC benchmarks that fail to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to limited cues or lack of fine-grained annotations.

Method: The authors create KnowDR-REC with three features: reliance on real-world knowledge for fine-grained multimodal reasoning, inclusion of negative samples through expression editing, and introduction of three new evaluation metrics to measure internal reasoning.

Result: Testing 16 multimodal models on KnowDR-REC showed that MLLMs struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks and suffer from a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding due to shortcut correlations.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights limitations in current MLLMs and emphasizes the need for robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks to enhance multimodal reasoning for real-world applications.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

*Yoshimasa Kubo,Jean Erik Delanois,Maxim Bazhenov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm to address catastrophic forgetting in RNNs trained with Equilibrium Propagation (EP), achieving superior results compared to traditional methods in continuous learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in RNNs, which conflicts with the human brain's ability to integrate old and new knowledge. Inspired by processes like memory consolidation during sleep, the authors aim to adapt similar mechanisms for artificial neural networks.

Method: The authors developed the SRC algorithm to implement sleep-like replay consolidation in EP-trained RNNs. It includes replay of learned information after each new task training, and is enhanced by combining SRC with rehearsal techniques.

Result: SRC significantly improved resilience to catastrophic forgetting in EP-trained RNNs. The MRNN-EP matched or exceeded performance of BPTT-based models across multiple datasets and showed improved long-term retention of knowledge in continuous learning setups.

Conclusion: SRC demonstrates the potential for integrating human-like sleep-inspired learning behaviors into ANNs, paving the way for machines to better mimic the human ability to retain knowledge while learning new tasks.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

*Ye Su,Hezhe Qiao,Wei Huang,Lin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative semi-supervised regression framework called DRILL, aiming to improve label distribution learning and reduce overfitting compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised regression faces challenges in reliance on pseudo-label quality and issues like overfitting from direct regression, necessitating an alternative approach.

Method: The paper introduces DRILL, which transforms regression tasks into discrete distribution estimation with bucketed labels and utilizes decoupled distribution alignment between teacher and student models.

Result: The DRILL framework demonstrated superior generalization capabilities and outperformed competing methods across diverse datasets in various domains.

Conclusion: DRILL effectively mitigates challenges in semi-supervised regression by leveraging discrete distribution estimation and alignment methods, proving its robustness and efficacy for diverse applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

*Songyu Ke,Chenyu Wu,Yuxuan Liang,Xiuwen Yi,Yanping Sun,Junbo Zhang,Yu Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study proposes a novel framework, termed as CSST, to accurately infer crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) using self-supervised attributed graph representation learning, aimed to overcome challenges posed by limited labeled data and spatio-temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the critical challenge of inferring accurate crowd flow at POIs using low-quality urban sensing data, necessary for traffic management, public service, and urban planning.

Method: The authors frame crowd flow inference as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning problem, utilizing a contrastive learning technique on spatio-temporal data, followed by fine-tuning on accurate labeled data.

Result: Experimental analysis across two real-world datasets reveals that the proposed framework pre-trained on noisy data consistently surpasses traditional models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the CSST framework effectively solves the problem of crowd flow inference by harnessing unlabeled spatio-temporal data, aiding urban applications like enhanced traffic management.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses period drift in cross-device federated learning (FL), proposing the FedEve framework to mitigate its impact and improve performance in non-iid data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle period drift in cross-device FL, which results from partial client participation and leads to performance degradation, especially in highly heterogeneous data.

Method: The authors introduce the predict-observe framework and propose FedEve, which compensates for the interaction between period drift and client drift to mitigate their effects.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that this method can reduce the variance of model updates, and experiments demonstrate superior performance over alternative methods on non-iid data.

Conclusion: The proposed FedEve approach effectively addresses period drift challenges, enhancing the performance of federated learning in cross-device, data-heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced sparse regression framework to autonomously discover interpretable partial differential equations (PDEs) and subgrid-scale (SGS) closures from data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in the current sparse identification approaches and reliably derive interpretable PDE models or SGS closures for turbulence-related simulations.

Method: The framework builds on SINDy with innovations: symbolic parameterization, dimensional consistency filtering, memory-efficient batch processing, and stability-focused ensemble models.

Result: The system reliably recovers governing equations for benchmark tests and autonomously discovers a Smagorinsky-like SGS closure with improved prediction accuracy ($R^2 = 0.886$).

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust and autonomous way to discover physically meaningful closure models, aiding the advancement of data-driven turbulence modeling techniques.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing distributed SGD (e.g., fixed topology and uniform node contributions) by exploring dynamic topologies, non-uniform aggregation strategies, and client selection for improved model performance.

Method: Unified framework encompassing Local-Update SGD-based algorithms with dynamic topologies, while offering enhanced or matching theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Result: Dynamic topologies and non-uniform strategies significantly outperform traditional fixed-topology methods. The proposed framework achieves better or equivalent theoretical convergence rates.

Conclusion: Leveraging dynamic topologies and non-uniform aggregation in distributed SGD models enhances convergence performance, offering a theoretical improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel EEG representation learning framework, EEGDM, combining structured state-space diffusion model and latent fusion transformer, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals is challenging due to limited annotations and high variability. Current EEG foundation models show potential but are computationally expensive with only marginal performance improvement.

Method: The proposed framework, EEGDM, employs a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining and denoising diffusion probabilistic model to capture EEG signal dynamics. Latent EEG representations are then utilized in downstream classification tasks via a latent fusion transformer.

Result: Empirical results on the Temple University EEG Event Corpus show that EEGDM outperformed existing state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG foundation models, while being approximately 19x computationally lighter.

Conclusion: EEGDM offers a computationally efficient and high-performing alternative to existing EEG foundation models for learning EEG signal representations and classification tasks.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Motivation: Existing federated distillation methods are resource-intensive, relying on computationally expensive statistical density ratio estimators and server-side filtering, which hinders scalability and increases latency.

Method: EdgeFD employs a KMeans-based density ratio estimator for efficient in-distribution and out-of-distribution proxy data filtering on clients, eliminating the need for server-side filtering.

Result: EdgeFD consistently achieves near-IID accuracy levels in non-IID scenarios, reduces computational costs, and is suitable for edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EdgeFD enhances scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation, delivering high accuracy under challenging conditions with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops a foundation model (FM) for particle physics, proving its scalability and generalization in diverse tasks using a novel training method and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if large language model-inspired foundation models can be adapted to experimental particle physics, especially with sparse and spatially distributed detector data.

Method: A new dataset of over 11 million particle collision events was created, alongside self-supervised training methods for detector data and models with up to 188 million parameters.

Result: The FM showed scalability, robust task performance, and data-efficient adaptation, surpassing baseline models in all evaluated tasks. Representations were task-agnostic but adaptable.

Conclusion: Particle physics FMs display scalability and generalization, with frozen weights and adapters enabling robust downstream performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

### [172] [CoBAD: Modeling Collective Behaviors for Human Mobility Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14088)
*Haomin Wen,Shurui Cao,Leman Akoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoBAD, a new method for identifying collective human mobility anomalies using attention mechanisms and unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and identifying anomalies in human mobility is crucial for public safety and urban planning. Existing methods focus on individual anomalies, leaving collective anomalies—requiring spatiotemporal dependency modeling—underexplored.

Method: The authors propose CoBAD, which uses a co-occurrence event graph for unsupervised learning over CES. It incorporates a two-stage attention mechanism, pre-trained on large data using reconstruction tasks, to detect both unexpected co-occurrence and absence anomalies.

Result: Through experiments on large-scale mobility datasets, CoBAD achieves significantly better performance than baselines with improvements of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Conclusion: CoBAD effectively addresses challenges in detecting collective mobility anomalies, outperforming existing methods and providing actionable insights for applications.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

*Matthew Morris,David J. Tena Cucala,Bernardo Cuenca Grau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving the explainability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in link prediction tasks by introducing monotonicity, enabling rule extraction and Datalog program equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the lack of explainability in GNNs for link prediction tasks in knowledge graphs, particularly when using a scoring function to decode predictions.

Method: This work adapts GNNs and scoring functions to be monotonic, enabling the extraction of sound rules for interpretation and linking these models to equivalent Datalog programs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that monotonic GNNs and scoring functions are practically effective on link prediction benchmarks, generating numerous sound rules.

Conclusion: Monotonic GNNs enhance both performance and explainability, bridging GNN predictions with interpretable Datalog rules and programs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) are introduced to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL) by enabling more expressive and programmable non-Markovian rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMs have been effective in enhancing expressiveness and programmability for RL agents, but the challenge lies in constructing reward mechanisms that support efficient learning algorithms.

Method: The paper introduces pRMs to design complex reward structures and integrates them into RL algorithms using techniques like counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that pRMs improve reward acquisition speed and learning efficiency in both finite and continuous physical environments.

Conclusion: Incorporating pRMs into RL algorithms makes learning more efficient and expressive, validating the proposed improvements in several control tasks.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of data difficulty selection for resource-constrained fine-tuning of language models, finding that prioritizing hard examples yields up to 47% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning language models for optimal performance is costly, and resource constraints limit data acquisition. The study examines whether data difficulty influences training efficiency within budget restrictions.

Method: The authors explore subset selection policies based on difficulty—easy, medium, hard, or random—using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning. Difficulty estimates are derived from multi-sample evaluation on an unlabeled pool.

Result: Training on hard examples achieves the highest performance gains of up to 47% compared to other difficulty levels, demonstrating that harder examples provide more learning opportunities.

Conclusion: For budget-constrained fine-tuning, prioritizing harder examples enhances performance on reasoning tasks when applying GRPO, giving practical guidance for model improvement.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

### [176] [Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101)
*Akash Choudhuri,Yongjian Zhong,Bijaya Adhikari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN) to address limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in hypergraph neural networks without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hypergraph neural networks struggle to balance capturing long-range dependencies and maintaining predictive performance, which limits their effectiveness in various domains.

Method: The authors propose IHNN, a framework using implicit differentiation and a projected gradient descent approach to jointly learn fixed-point representations for nodes and hyperedges.

Result: Experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification show that IHNN outperforms previous methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: IHNN effectively addresses the long-range dependency issues in hypergraph neural networks, improving their overall performance for predictive tasks.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reinforcement learning algorithms TRPO and PPO, focusing on their behavior with varying action space dimensionality and morphological generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for scalable and reusable control policies capable of handling diverse kinematic structures in continuous control tasks.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis of optimization landscapes in TRPO and PPO under varying dimensions and empirical evaluation using a controlled Gymnasium Swimmer environment.

Result: Theoretical insights on action space dimensionality's impact and empirical evidence leveraging the Swimmer environment's morphological variations.

Conclusion: Trust region optimization can be adapted for morphological generalization, but these methods require further study under varying action spaces.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from

Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm,
where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency.
Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated

of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials
science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives --
process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a
comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core
processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i)
trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities
underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage

Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.

*Madyan Bagosher,Tala Mustafa,Mohammad Alsmirat,Amal Al-Ali,Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: To tackle campus parking issues, a data-driven framework was developed using location services and forecasting models, finding Random Forest Regression to be most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: University campuses face parking challenges due to high demand during class hours, necessitating efficient allocation systems.

Method: A smart framework integrates data sources via spatial join, evaluating parking behavior and vehicle movement with forecasting models like Linear Regression, SVR, RFR, and LSTM.

Result: Random Forest Regression achieved the best predictive performance with RMSE of 0.142 and R2 of 0.582.

Conclusion: The proposed system shows promise for optimizing campus parking without requiring physical sensors, with potential for improvement using LSTM over extended datasets.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing shape memory alloy (SMA) compositions for target properties and cost using machine learning and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to design affordable and sustainable SMAs that meet specific performance targets, addressing challenges related to complex trade-offs in material properties and cost.

Method: Machine learning models (tree-based ensemble and neural network) were trained on experimental data and physics-informed features. These models were paired with numerical optimizers (COBYLA and TRUST-CONSTR) to identify suitable SMA compositions.

Result: Both models accurately predicted Martensitic start temperature (Ms), but the neural network paired with the gradient-based TRUST-CONSTR optimizer consistently achieved better results than the tree-based model with COBYLA.

Conclusion: Combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and efficient optimization algorithms provides a reliable framework for SMA design. This method can be adapted for other materials facing similar trade-offs.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the ERIS framework to improve time series classification (TSC) by enabling guided feature disentanglement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in OOD robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor performance in time series classification (TSC) on out-of-distribution (OOD) data caused by the model's entanglement of domain-specific and label-relevant features.

Method: The ERIS framework introduces an energy-guided calibration for semantic guidance, a weight-level orthogonality strategy for structural independence, and auxiliary adversarial training for enhanced robustness.

Result: Experiments show ERIS achieves an average improvement of 4.04% accuracy over state-of-the-art methods across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: ERIS achieves reliable feature disentanglement and improves OOD robustness for TSC through a combination of semantic guidance, orthogonality, and adversarial training mechanisms.

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework to optimize sensor placement in modal testing using reinforcement learning for better adaptability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modal test designs are inflexible and fail to adapt to changing experimental conditions, compromising accuracy and effectiveness.

Method: An agent-based framework utilizing partially observable Markov decision processes and a dual-curriculum reinforcement learning strategy to adapt sensor placement.

Result: A case study on a steel cantilever structure showcases improved sensor location optimization across frequency segments.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust adaptability and practical effectiveness in real-world experimental modal testing scenarios.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-learning framework to estimate the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) of traffic networks with scarce loop detector data, achieving significant improvements in flow prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of estimating traffic dynamics (MFD) in networks with limited loop detector availability.

Method: A meta-learning framework using Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Networks is developed and trained on data from multiple cities to estimate the MFD for other cities with varying detector shares and structures.

Result: The model shows significant improvement in flow prediction accuracy (MSE reduction ~17500 to 36000) and generalizes well across urban settings with limited detector data.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learning framework proves its transferability and effectiveness, outperforming traditional transfer learning and non-parametric FitFun models, making it valuable for data-sparse traffic networks.

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

*Orestis Konstantaropoulos,Stelios Manolis Smirnakis,Maria Papadopouli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes G2GNet, an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture that integrates biologically inspired sparse and modular connectivity patterns, improving both accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the efficient design principles found in biological neural circuits, such as modularity, hierarchy, and sparsity, and their potential applications in designing more efficient ANNs.

Method: The authors developed G2GNet, an ANN architecture inspired by functional connectivity patterns observed in the mouse visual cortex. It incorporates static biologically-informed structural biases and dynamic sparse training (DST), including Hebbian-inspired rules for edge rewiring.

Result: G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on vision benchmarks like Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming denser, fully connected baselines.

Conclusion: By integrating neuroscience-inspired connectivity patterns and dynamic training mechanisms, G2GNet demonstrates that biologically informed structures can enhance both the performance and efficiency of ANNs.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

### [186] [Beyond Turing: Memory-Amortized Inference as a Foundation for Cognitive Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14143)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a framework where cognition relies on structured memory reuse rather than recomputation, providing insights into biological intelligence and implications for artificial general intelligence (AGI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand intelligence not as a result of uniform sampling or optimization from scratch but as emerging from structured memory reuse, addressing limitations in traditional AI methodologies.

Method: The paper develops the MAI framework, which models cognition as inference over latent cycles in memory and uses delta-homology to establish theoretical principles.

Result: MAI explains cognitive processes as navigations over constrained memory-based manifolds and establishes a duality between its framework and reinforcement learning, showing its potential to reduce computational inefficiencies.

Conclusion: The study presents MAI as a biologically inspired model of intelligence centered on the structured reuse of memory, with applications in achieving more efficient and advanced AI systems like AGI.

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

*Zahra Rastin,Kathrin Donandt,Dirk Söffker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates various deep learning-based vessel trajectory prediction models to assess their reliability under different traffic complexities using probability of detection analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior vessel trajectory prediction models that ignore traffic complexity and do not assess model reliability.

Method: The paper applies probability of detection analysis and categorizes test samples based on traffic situations during the prediction horizon, evaluating model performance and reliability for each category.

Result: The analysis provides insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and reliability of different prediction models for varying traffic complexities and prediction horizons.

Conclusion: The findings guide the improvement of vessel trajectory prediction models, aiming for safer and more efficient inland waterway navigation.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

### [188] [Graph Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14255)
*Haotian Xu,Tsui-Wei Weng,Lam M. Nguyen,Tengfei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphCBMs introduce a model enhancing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with latent concept graphs to capture relationships among concepts, improving interpretability and performance in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CBMs assume concepts are independent and ignore relationships among them, which limits their ability to represent interconnected concepts inherent in many datasets.

Method: GraphCBMs construct latent concept graphs to model relationships among concepts. These graphs enhance CBMs by integrating relational information, allowing for better performance and interpretability.

Result: Experiments on real-world image classification tasks show that GraphCBMs improve classification accuracy, interpretability, and intervention effectiveness, and maintain performance robustness under various setups.

Conclusion: GraphCBMs successfully address conditional independence limitations in CBMs, providing a framework that combines concept interpretability with improved model performance and robustness.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

*Amirmohsen Sattarifard,Sepehr Lavasani,Ehsan Imani,Kunlin Zhang,Hanlin Xu,Fengyu Sun,Negar Hassanpour,Chao Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes A/I-GLASS, a method to dynamically prune FFN units in LLMs, improving efficiency without added inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on edge hardware requires minimizing computational demands without compromising quality, which current methods struggle to balance.

Method: Introduces A/I-GLASS, two training-free dynamic pruning methods that aggregate neuron importance using both local prompt-based and global model-intrinsic statistics.

Result: GLASS significantly outperforms existing training-free pruning methods, particularly in long-generation tasks, while avoiding runtime overhead or reliance on auxiliary predictors.

Conclusion: A/I-GLASS is an effective, efficient, and adaptive solution for dynamic pruning in LLMs, achieving better balance between computation and quality than prior methods.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

### [190] [Learning Time-Varying Convexifications of Multiple Fairness Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14311)
*Quan Zhou,Jakub Marecek,Robert Shorten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on learning dynamically adjustable fairness measures with limited graph-structured feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing recognition that fairness in machine learning requires considering multiple measures, both group and individual, which may need to adapt over time.

Method: The study proposes an approach for learning time-varying convex combinations of fairness measures utilizing feedback structured as a graph.

Result: The paper enables the dynamic adjustment of fairness regularizers based on graph-structured feedback, addressing fairness challenges in evolving contexts.

Conclusion: This approach expands fairness learning by making it adaptable to temporal changes and limited structural feedback, increasing its versatility in real-world applications.

Abstract: There is an increasing appreciation that one may need to consider multiple
measures of fairness, e.g., considering multiple group and individual fairness
notions. The relative weights of the fairness regularisers are a priori
unknown, may be time varying, and need to be learned on the fly. We consider
the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures
with limited graph-structured feedback.

### [191] [Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313)
*Can Jin,Yang Zhou,Qixin Zhang,Hongwu Peng,Di Zhang,Marco Pavone,Ligong Han,Zhang-Wei Hong,Tong Che,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AIRL-S, a framework that unifies RL-based methods with search-based TTS for large language models, showing improved performance using adversarial inverse reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling methods for LLMs face limitations like instability in RL methods and performance degradation in search-based methods without effective reward models.

Method: The authors introduce AIRL-S, which combines adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to create a dense process reward model (PRM) directly from reasoning data, eliminating the need for labeled data. The PRM acts as both a critic and heuristic during inference.

Result: AIRL-S improves average performance by 9% across eight benchmarks, matches GPT-4o, and outperforms baseline PRMs in multiple search algorithms.

Conclusion: The reward function learned in RL serves as an ideal PRM, providing a cost-effective and robust solution to complex reasoning tasks, improving generalization, and addressing limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

*Pritthijit Nath,Sebastian Schemm,Henry Moss,Peter Haynes,Emily Shuckburgh,Mark Webb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRAIN-Lite introduces a framework for federated reinforcement learning that adapts sub-grid parameterisations in climate models to evolving states. Results demonstrate superiority of the DDPG algorithm in parameter learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of static sub-grid parameterisations in climate models, seeking adaptability to changing climatic conditions.

Method: The authors propose FedRAIN-Lite, assigning RL agents to latitude bands for localized learning, and aggregating results periodically across agents. They benchmark RL algorithms using energy-balance climate model hierarchies.

Result: DDPG algorithm outperforms static methods and single-agent baselines in terms of convergence speed and error metrics, showing effective performance in adaptive parameter learning.

Conclusion: FedRAIN-Lite provides a scalable approach for high-complexity, geographically adaptive climate models that evolve dynamically with climate changes.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

*Nícolas Roque dos Santos,Dawon Ahn,Diego Minatel,Alneu de Andrade Lopes,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method named GCTD (Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition) to reduce the computational demands of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by creating compact, informative graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs is computationally expensive due to storage and processing challenges. Existing graph condensation methods often lack interpretability and use resource-intensive bi-level optimization. The study aims to explore tensor decomposition as an alternative.

Method: The paper introduces GCTD, a graph condensation method utilizing tensor decomposition techniques to synthesize smaller, informative graphs while maintaining GNN's predictive performance.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show that GCTD reduces graph size effectively and achieves competitive or better performance, with up to a 4% accuracy improvement on three datasets and strong results on large graphs.

Conclusion: GCTD demonstrates the potential of tensor decomposition in graph condensation by achieving effective size reduction and maintaining—or improving—GNN predictive performance. It serves as a transparent and resource-efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

*Xu Weng,K. V. Ling,Haochen Liu,Bingheng Wang,Kun Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeRC, an end-to-end framework to improve GNSS localization in urban areas using neural networks without requiring labeled ranging error data, achieving enhanced accuracy and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of GNSS localization errors in urban environments caused by satellite signal disruptions and low-quality GNSS hardware on mobile devices.

Method: Propose NeRC, a robust neural network-based framework trained using ground-truth locations and leveraging differentiable moving horizon estimation and Euclidean Distance Field cost maps.

Result: Demonstrated improved positioning accuracy on public and custom datasets and validated real-time performance on edge devices.

Conclusion: NeRC effectively improves GNSS localization accuracy and operability on mobile devices, offering scalable solutions for urban navigation challenges.

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

*Junwei Su,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how graph structure influences the learning performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), with particular focus on generalization and excess risk of algorithms like SGD and Ridge regression, offering theoretical and empirical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in how graph structure affects the generalization performance of learning algorithms in GNNs under noisy scenarios.

Method: The paper extends learning theory to GNNs, deriving excess risk profiles of learning algorithms using spectral graph theory, and analyzes the impact of graph structures like regular and power-law graphs. It also explores multi-layer linear GNNs to study over-smoothing effects.

Result: The findings establish a connection between graph structure and learning dynamics, revealing how graph properties influence generalization performance quantitatively and qualitatively. Empirical results validate the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the interplay of graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms, providing new insights for GNN design and selection, especially in scenarios with noise.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

TL;DR: This study explores teacher-guided techniques for enhancing Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO), leading to better early-stage performance and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing applications in ACO using RL suffer from slow learning processes and poor initial results, prompting the need for enhanced methods to accelerate efficiency.

Method: The authors implement and compare four teacher-guided RL techniques within a simulated CybORG environment.

Result: Teacher integration significantly improved both early policy performance and convergence speed during the RL training.

Conclusion: Teacher-guided approaches hold promising potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of RL-based autonomous cybersecurity systems.

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

*Lingkai Kong,Haichuan Wang,Charles A. Emogor,Vincent Börsch-Supan,Lily Xu,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses poaching prediction by using a novel flow matching generative model that accounts for imperfect detection and data scarcity to improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to improve the prediction of poacher behavior, which is critical for wildlife conservation. Existing methods lack the capability to handle complex spatiotemporal patterns and are limited by imperfect data and scarcity.

Method: The authors propose a model combining flow matching with an occupancy-based detection framework. They train the model in latent space to address detection imperfections and use a composite flow initialized with linear-model predictions to enhance generalization despite data limitations.

Result: The study shows improved predictive accuracy for poaching behavior using datasets from two national parks in Uganda, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates generative modeling techniques to overcome the challenges of imperfect event detection and scarce data, offering gains in predicting poaching behavior.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

*Junwei Su,Shan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) is proposed to overcome scalability and size generalization issues in graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs). It uses block graph representation for efficient memory usage and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GDGMs face challenges in scaling to large graphs due to high memory requirements and demonstrate poor size generalization when generating graphs of sizes different from the training data.

Method: SBGD introduces a block graph space using structural priors based on real-world graph patterns to reduce memory complexity and improve size generalization.

Result: Empirical results show up to 6× memory improvement and superior graph generation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with improved generalization to unseen graph sizes.

Conclusion: SBGD is not only scalable and effective for generating graphs but also illustrates modularization principles in generative modeling, paving the way for breaking complex tasks into smaller subcomponents.

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

### [199] [DuPO: Enabling Reliable LLM Self-Verification via Dual Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14460)
*Shuaijie She,Yu Bao,Yu Lu,Lu Xu,Tao Li,Wenhao Zhu,Shujian Huang,Shanbo Cheng,Lu Lu,Yuxuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuPO is a dual learning-based framework that enhances task performance without requiring labeled data by creating a self-supervised feedback loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of RLVR's dependency on costly labels and restricted applicability, as well as traditional dual learning's constraint to strictly dual task pairs.

Method: DuPO decomposes input into known and unknown components and uses a dual task to reconstruct the unknown part. It leverages LLMs to perform both tasks using a single model and optimizes the primal task through self-supervised feedback.

Result: DuPO achieved a 2.13 COMET improvement in translation quality over 756 directions, a 6.4-point gain in mathematical reasoning accuracy across three benchmarks, and a 9.3-point boost as an inference-time reranker.

Conclusion: DuPO provides a scalable, general, and annotation-free solution for optimizing LLM performance across various tasks.

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Organ-Agents, a framework using large language models (LLMs) to simulate human physiology through multi-agent coordination for sepsis prediction and treatment modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable, high-fidelity simulations of complex physiological systems that could support critical care diagnosis, treatment planning, and hypothesis testing in sepsis and other conditions.

Method: The approach combines LLM-based multi-agent models, supervised fine-tuning with time-series data, and reinforcement-based dynamic coordination. Data from sepsis and ICU patients were used to train and validate the framework on high-resolution, multi-system simulations.

Result: Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy with low mean squared error rates and demonstrated resilience against distribution shifts. Simulation realism was validated by critical care physicians, and synthetic data remained useful in early warning tasks.

Conclusion: Organ-Agents shows potential as a reliable, interpretable simulation tool for precision medicine, especially in sepsis care, enabling realistic physiological modeling and counterfactual analyses for better clinical insights.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

### [201] [Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385)
*Kim Hammar,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOBAL, an online Bayesian method for cyberattack incident response, addressing model inaccuracies and adapting dynamically as new information arises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional incident response frameworks require detailed system models, making them impractical for real-time situations with uncertain or incomplete data.

Method: MOBAL employs Bayesian learning to iteratively refine an initial model, converting the learned conjecture into a quantized finite Markov model for efficient dynamic programming during response planning.

Result: Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark demonstrate MOBAL's superiority in adaptability and robustness against model inaccuracies compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MOBAL provides a scalable and effective solution for real-time incident response, ensuring asymptotic consistency and bounded errors under model misspecification and quantization.

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

### [202] [Disentanglement in T-space for Faster and Distributed Training of Diffusion Models with Fewer Latent-states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14413)
*Samarth Gupta,Raghudeep Gadde,Rui Chen,Aleix M. Martinez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that diffusion models can achieve comparable generative performance using a much smaller number of latent states, challenging the assumption that many latent states are necessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models suggest that a large number of latent states is essential to approximate Gaussian distributions effectively during training. This paper seeks to challenge and refine this assumption.

Method: The authors propose optimizing the noise schedule and demonstrate that diffusion models with significantly fewer latent states can perform as well as traditional models. They also introduce single latent-state models to achieve disentanglement.

Result: The experiments indicate that the proposed methods provide 4-6 times faster convergence rates while maintaining high sample quality on two datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that diffusion models can operate efficiently and effectively with fewer latent states, opening pathways for faster and computationally cheaper generative modeling.

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

*Ajan Subramanian,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to analyze wearable sensor data for personalized health monitoring by generating counterfactual models that predict individual responses to lifestyle interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of extracting actionable insights from complex, longitudinal wearable sensor data streams to help individuals understand the potential outcomes of lifestyle choices.

Method: The framework uses multi-modal similarity analysis to enhance datasets with information from similar patients and adapts a temporal PC algorithm to identify predictive relationships. Gradient Boosting Machines are employed to model these relationships, which then power a counterfactual engine for projecting hypothetical physiological trajectories.

Result: The framework demonstrates reasonable predictive accuracy (e.g., mean heart rate MAE of 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility (median of 0.9643), evidencing significant inter-individual variability in simulated lifestyle responses.

Conclusion: The introduced framework successfully highlights the potential for personalized health monitoring by exploring individual-specific effects of hypothetical lifestyle changes, providing a basis for generating personalized health hypotheses.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

### [204] [Fast Symbolic Regression Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14481)
*Viktor Martinek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to symbolic regression benchmarks to better reflect SR algorithm performance, using curated acceptable expression lists and early stopping features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current symbolic regression benchmarks focus on rediscovering exact single-form expressions and rely heavily on computer algebra systems, resulting in inefficient evaluation.

Method: The paper proposes curated acceptable expressions and a callback mechanism for early termination, applied to SRSD benchmark problems. They test these improvements using SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR.

Result: The improvements boost SymbolicRegression.jl's rediscovery rate to 44.7% (from 26.7%) and reduce computational expense by 41.2%. TiSR achieves 69.4% rediscovery with a 63% reduction in computation time.

Conclusion: By refining benchmarks with curated expression lists and early termination, the paper enables more effective and efficient evaluation of symbolic regression algorithms.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

### [205] [On the notion of missingness for path attribution explainability methods in medical settings: Guiding the selection of medically meaningful baselines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14482)
*Alexander Geiger,Lars Wagner,Daniel Rueckert,Dirk Wilhelm,Alissa Jell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a principled counterfactual-guided approach to improve the explainability of deep learning models in the medical domain, focusing on path attribution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable and clinically relevant outputs in deep learning models for medical applications highlights the inadequacy of semantically meaningless baseline inputs used in existing path attribution methods like Integrated Gradients.

Method: The study introduces a counterfactual-guided baseline selection approach, leveraging a Variational Autoencoder to generate clinically normal but input-close baseline data. This method is generative-model-agnostic and can apply to other counterfactual models.

Result: The approach was tested on three medical datasets and demonstrated superior faithfulness and medical relevance in attribution compared to conventional baseline methods.

Conclusion: Counterfactual-guided baselines represent a more principled and clinically meaningful alternative to traditional baselines, improving the interpretability of model explanations in medical settings.

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

*Huan Ma,Jiadong Pan,Jing Liu,Yan Chen,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Guangyu Wang,Qinghua Hu,Hua Wu,Changqing Zhang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates a novel method called Semantic Energy to enhance hallucination detection in LLMs by leveraging inherent uncertainty and logits-based operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like semantic entropy fail to adequately address hallucinations in LLMs due to reliance on post-softmax probabilities, which do not capture inherent uncertainty.

Method: The Semantic Energy framework uses logits from the penultimate layer and combines semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution to improve uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments show that Semantic Energy outperforms existing methods in hallucination detection across multiple benchmarks, providing higher reliability for downstream applications.

Conclusion: Semantic Energy offers a significant advancement in understanding and mitigating LLM hallucinations by addressing shortcomings of semantic entropy and enhancing uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

### [207] [Exact Shapley Attributions in Quadratic-time for FANOVA Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14499)
*Majid Mohammadi,Krikamol Muandet,Ilaria Tiddi,Annette Ten Teije,Siu Lun Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient methods to compute exact Shapley values for FANOVA Gaussian Processes (GPs) in quadratic time, enhancing model explanation scalability and accounting for uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values are a robust method for feature importance attribution but are computationally expensive, especially in probabilistic models like GPs. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors leverage closed-form stochastic Möbius representations and novel recursive algorithms inspired by Newton's identities to compute Shapley values for FANOVA GPs in quadratic time.

Result: The work provides methods to compute both local (stochastic) and global (deterministic) Shapley values, capturing feature contributions and uncertainties efficiently.

Conclusion: These methods offer scalable, sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions, advancing the applicability of explainable AI in probabilistic models.

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Transformer-based anomaly detection method for cloud services, emphasizing temporal and multiscale feature modeling, and reports superior detection performance under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation for detecting anomalies in dynamic cloud service environments.

Method: It employs an improved Transformer architecture for long-range temporal modeling and self-attention-based feature extraction. Additionally, multiscale feature perception and a fusion module are designed for robust anomaly detection.

Result: Experimental findings highlight that the method excels over baseline models in metrics like precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and remains stable under perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates strong potential and effectiveness for anomaly detection in complex and variable cloud service settings.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

*Kevin Riehl,Shaimaa K. El-Baklish,Anastasios Kouvelas,Michail A. Makridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel hybrid trajectory prediction framework for bicycles, integrating physics-based and social-based modeling with graph attention networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for improved road user movement prediction, specifically for bicycles, which are often overlooked despite their involvement in many traffic accidents.

Method: The Great GATsBi framework combines physics-based modeling for short-term predictions and social-based modeling for long-term predictions using a graph attention network to capture social interactions.

Result: The framework exceeds state-of-the-art performance in accurate bicycle trajectory predictions and demonstrates effectiveness in controlled experiments.

Conclusion: The dual-nature approach, combining physics and social insights, is effective for improving predictions of bicycle movements, contributing to enhanced road safety.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

*Saman Yazdannik,Morteza Tayefi,Shamim Sanisales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates Chebyshev polynomials into Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to achieve efficient reinforcement learning. It demonstrates improved performance in the CartPole-v1 task but highlights sensitivity to the polynomial degree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the action-value function approximation in DQNs, addressing the limitations of standard neural networks in handling complex reinforcement learning problems.

Method: The authors propose integrating Chebyshev polynomials as a basis within the DQN framework to enhance feature representation and function approximation.

Result: The Ch-DQN achieved a 39% performance improvement over standard DQN on the CartPole-v1 task when using a polynomial degree of 4. However, a higher degree (e.g., N=8) was found to impede learning.

Conclusion: The study showcases the efficacy of orthogonal polynomial bases, like Chebyshev, in reinforcement learning, but emphasizes the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning for balancing model complexity and learning efficiency.

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

### [211] [Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544)
*Zixi Chen,Yinyu Ye,Zijie Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of optimizing the scheduling of large language model (LLM) inference to reduce latency and energy usage. It proposes new algorithms to address uncertainties in output length predictions and validates efficiency through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to optimize LLM inference scheduling, as current processes are resource-intensive, involving high latency and power consumption, with added complexity from unpredictable output lengths.

Method: The authors propose two algorithms: the conservative $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which uses the upper bound of output length predictions, and the adaptive $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, which starts with lower bound predictions and dynamically adjusts.

Result: Numerical simulations show that the adaptive $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ algorithm performs nearly as well as an optimal hindsight scheduler, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ algorithm addresses scheduling uncertainties effectively, offering a resource-efficient and reliable solution for LLM inference, with promising results in realistic conditions.

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of different density-ratio estimation algorithms on fairness measurement in regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the sensitivity of fairness measurement methods to the choice of underlying density-ratio estimation methods in ML regression.

Method: Develops various fairness measurement methods with different density-ratio estimation cores and conducts thorough experiments to evaluate their impact.

Result: The choice of density-ratio estimation affects fairness measurement outcomes significantly, sometimes producing inconsistent results in comparing algorithm fairness.

Conclusion: Density-ratio-based fairness measurements in regression may be unreliable, highlighting a need for further research to improve these methods.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DualNILM is a Transformer-based deep learning framework for non-intrusive load monitoring that addresses challenges posed by behind-the-meter energy sources by performing dual tasks of appliance state recognition and energy injection identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve NILM performance arises due to behind-the-meter energy sources, such as solar panels and batteries, which obscure individual appliance power signatures and degrade the efficiency of traditional NILM methods.

Method: The paper introduces DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework that combines sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies for accurate dual-task predictions.

Result: Experimental validation using various datasets shows that DualNILM significantly outperforms conventional NILM methods and delivers excellent results for both appliance state recognition and energy injection identification.

Conclusion: DualNILM provides a robust framework to enhance NILM performance in modern energy ecosystems with behind-the-meter sources, presenting an effective solution to overcome the challenges posed by such energy injections.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI) framework to analyze factors influencing Continuous Descent Operations (CDO), achieving interpretable high-accuracy models for aviation use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research lacks a systematic examination of factors affecting CDO performance and explainability in aviation models, which is critical for safety and operational trust.

Method: The study collects features from 1,094 flights using ADS-B data and applies machine learning models with SHAP analysis to classify CDO adherence levels. Fuzzy logic is used to create interpretable fuzzy rules.

Result: Top predictors of CDO performance were identified, yielding models with over 90% accuracy and human-readable fuzzy rules. Key predictors included average descent rate, number of descent segments, and directional heading changes.

Conclusion: FEXAI enables interpretable and accurate predictions for CDO adherence and has potential for real-time aviation tools to enhance operational decision-making under varying conditions.

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

*Luis H. John,Jan A. Kors,Jenna M. Reps,Peter R. Rijnbeek,Egill A. Fridgeirsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores improving lung cancer onset prediction by mapping medical term hierarchies into hyperbolic space using Poincaré embeddings and integrating them into deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical prediction models often fail to capture semantic relationships within patient data. The paper aims to enhance these models by encoding hierarchical semantic information within clinical concepts.

Method: The authors mapped the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using Poincaré embeddings and incorporated these embeddings into ResNet and Transformer models. Model performance was evaluated based on discrimination and calibration metrics.

Result: Poincaré embeddings improved discrimination performance modestly and calibration consistently. ResNet models showed improved calibration with 10-dimensional embeddings, while Transformers exhibited stable calibration.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings improve clinical prediction models by preserving hierarchical structures, providing a scalable and effective method for integrating domain-specific clinical knowledge into deep learning models for lung cancer prediction.

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

*Haoru Tan,Sitong Wu,Xiuzhe Wu,Wang Wang,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Gui-Song Xia,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-In, a second-order method to estimate sample influence in training neural networks, achieving high accuracy without assuming model convexity, and demonstrates superior performance in data-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing data analysis tools, particularly their low accuracy and reliance on model convexity assumptions.

Method: The method formulates influence as cumulative differences across training iterations and uses second-order approximations for efficient and scalable computations, leveraging Hessian-gradient products.

Result: Diff-In achieves lower approximation errors theoretically and performs better empirically across multiple datasets and tasks, including large-scale vision-language pre-training.

Conclusion: Diff-In effectively addresses existing challenges in influence estimation with high accuracy, scalability, and broad applicability across various data-centric tasks.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELATE, a method leveraging a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series prediction, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual and time-intensive feature engineering for time-series prediction limits modeling efficiency, and existing automated methods are computationally costly and lack domain-specific insights.

Method: ELATE integrates a language model into an evolutionary framework, using time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide feature selection, while the language model proposes contextually relevant transformations.

Result: ELATE enhances forecasting accuracy, achieving an 8.4% average improvement across different domains.

Conclusion: The approach automates and improves the efficiency of feature engineering, offering better predictive performance for time-series data with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

### [218] [Improving Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Counterfactual Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14683)
*Zengyi Wo,Chang Liu,Yumeng Wang,Minglai Shao,Wenjun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fair-ICD, a counterfactual data augmentation approach to reduce bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) while maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs, widely used for graph-structured data, often show bias in predictions based on sensitive attributes, exacerbated by graph structures and message-passing. Current bias mitigation methods risk reducing prediction accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, Fair-ICD, generates counterfactual data to create diverse neighborhoods before message passing and uses an adversarial discriminator to minimize bias while training on GNN models.

Result: Fair-ICD shows significant improvement in fairness metrics across standard datasets with three GNN backbones, without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD provides a balanced solution for bias mitigation in GNNs, utilizing counterfactual data augmentation and adversarial techniques effectively to enhance fairness and maintain accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

*Zengyi Wo,Wenjun Wang,Minglai Shao,Chang Liu,Yumeng Wang,Yueheng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs using a spectral neural network CES2-GAD, leveraging causal edge separation and hybrid-spectrum filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting anomalous entities in heterophilic graphs, where traditional GNNs often fail due to the complex relationships and spectral shifts caused by heterophily.

Method: A spectral neural network, CES2-GAD, separates graphs into homophilic and heterophilic edges via causal interventions, uses hybrid-spectrum filters for signal extraction, and combines signal representations for anomaly classification.

Result: CES2-GAD achieves effective anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs, demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CES2-GAD provides a robust framework for detecting anomalies in heterophilic networks, addressing key issues in spectral and structural graph analysis.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AFABench, the first benchmark framework for Active Feature Acquisition (AFA), which evaluates performance trade-offs in acquiring informative features under cost constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring all features of a data instance can be costly or impractical in real scenarios, creating a need for methods that balance predictive performance with acquisition cost (Active Feature Acquisition).

Method: The authors developed AFABench, a benchmark framework with synthetic and real-world datasets, modular design, and capacity to integrate various AFA methods. A novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, was introduced to test the limitations of greedy policies.

Result: The benchmark facilitates the evaluation of static, greedy, and reinforcement learning AFA methods, detecting trade-offs and providing insights for better strategy selection.

Conclusion: AFABench establishes a standardized, diverse, and extensible framework for evaluating AFA approaches. It highlights actionable insights to address challenges in data acquisition under constraints.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, D-GSR, to directly optimize reasoning graphs using task-specific data, significantly enhancing performance in video anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between reasoning graphs from LLMs and their application in visual downstream tasks, where existing graph refinement techniques are inadequate.

Method: Proposes a data-driven Graph Structure Refinement (D-GSR) framework called MissionHD, based on hyperdimensional computing (HDC). It optimizes graph structure through an encode-decode process guided by downstream task signals.

Result: Experimental results on video anomaly detection and recognition benchmarks show marked performance improvements with the refined graphs.

Conclusion: D-GSR and MissionHD provide an efficient method to adapt reasoning graphs for improved task alignment, serving as an effective pre-processing step.

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

*Yunzhe Zhang,Yifei Wang,Khanh Vinh Nguyen,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMCM-DLM, a method to enable pre-trained SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation to support cross-modality constraints (e.g., molecular structure, chemical properties) without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models require retraining when constraints change and can only accommodate single-modality constraints, which is inefficient and limits adaptability for real-world applications involving multiple or evolving constraints.

Method: The proposed CMCM-DLM incorporates two trainable modules: the Structure Control Module (SCM) for structural constraints and the Property Control Module (PCM) for refining chemical properties. These are applied in two phases of the generation process.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the method efficiently supports multi-modality constraints, showing strong adaptability and precision in molecule generation.

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM significantly enhances molecular generation, making it a practical tool for drug discovery and adaptable to dynamic, real-world constraint requirements.

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

*Thomas Carta,Clément Romac,Loris Gaven,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Olivier Sigaud,Sylvain Lamprier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HERAKLES, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework utilizing language models to scale effectively in open-ended environments and enable agents to learn complex goals efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended AI agents need to learn goals of increasing complexity and abstraction while keeping computational and sample efficiency manageable.

Method: The HERAKLES framework integrates a two-level hierarchy: a Large Language Model as the high-level controller for goal decomposition and generalization, and a low-level neural network for compiled goals as executable subpolicies.

Result: HERAKLES scales well with increasing goal complexity, enhances sample efficiency, and allows robust adaptation to novel challenges, as demonstrated in the Crafter environment.

Conclusion: HERAKLES presents a significant advancement for developing open-ended autotelic agents by utilizing hierarchical reinforcement learning and language model strengths for scalable goal learning.

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PepThink-R1 is a new generative framework for therapeutic peptide design that integrates large language models, chain-of-thought reasoning, and reinforcement learning to optimize pharmacological properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing therapeutic peptides is challenging due to large sequence space, limited data, and lack of interpretability in existing models.

Method: PepThink-R1 combines large language models, chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. It employs explicit reasoning about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation and uses a tailored reward function for optimization.

Result: The model generates cyclic peptides with improved lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming general LLMs and domain-specific baselines in optimization and interpretability.

Conclusion: PepThink-R1 advances peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery by integrating explicit reasoning and property control.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

*Guillermo Sarasa Durán,Ana Granados Fontecha,Francisco de Borja Rodríguez Ortíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'context steering,' a method to actively tailor compression-based distances (CD) for tasks like clustering and classification by guiding the feature generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of aligning similarity features derived from data with specific tasks in complex settings motivates the need for an enhanced method.

Method: Context steering systematically analyzes how objects influence relational contexts in clustering frameworks, generating tailored embeddings to enhance class-distinctive information.

Result: The robustness and generality of context steering were validated on heterogeneous datasets (e.g., text and audio), outperforming traditional methods in clustering and classification tasks.

Conclusion: Context steering transforms the use of compression-based distances from passive data structure discovery to an active process of tailoring feature spaces for targeted objectives.

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive distillation method using synthetic data augmentation and efficient vectorized teacher-student interaction, yielding significant improvements in model compression and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional distillation approaches face challenges like computational overhead and limited generalization when transferring knowledge from large models to smaller ones.

Method: The proposed method uses UMAP for dimensionality reduction to locate high-loss regions in the embedding space. Synthetic data is then generated for these regions, alongside a streamlined teacher-student interface based on vectorized representations.

Result: The adaptive distillation framework achieves competitive results across NLP benchmarks, e.g., 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, with reduced training epochs and using a 66M-parameter student model.

Conclusion: Loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation can efficiently compress models while maintaining high performance in NLP tasks.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

TL;DR: The paper provides a domain-agnostic guide for managing complex manual annotation projects, especially for scientific imagery, addressing interconnected challenges like data collection, bias mitigation, resource allocation, and team training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing manual annotation projects involves diverse challenges that are often under-discussed and lack practical guidelines, particularly in scientific imagery.

Method: The authors leverage their extensive experience to create a preparation guide covering annotation success metrics, selecting subjects, setting goals, team roles, human bias mitigation, and recommending tools to improve efficiency.

Result: The paper consolidates guidelines and recommendations to address diverse challenges in manual annotation projects, aiming to improve quality and reduce costs.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes the need for a comprehensive framework and further research to develop a robust knowledge base for effectively managing manual annotation projects across fields.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex

the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM), a framework for guiding generative models by modifying the source distribution instead of the probability flow vector field. The approach reduces complexity while ensuring accurate guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for generative model guidance often rely on altering the probability flow vector field. This work aims to simplify and redefine guidance for generative models by focusing directly on the source distribution.

Method: The proposed Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework modifies the source distribution, leaving the pre-trained vector field unchanged. The framework includes theoretical guarantees for recovering the target distribution and provides error bounds for cases utilizing approximate sampling methods.

Result: The SGFM framework demonstrated effectiveness in experimental tests, including synthetic benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks. Comparisons showed flexibility in choosing sampling methods and validated theoretical claims.

Conclusion: SGFM simplifies guidance for generative models, ensuring exact recovery of the desired target distribution and offering flexibility in sampling methods. Its integration with optimal flow models makes it practical for diverse applications.

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

### [230] [Enhancing Contrastive Link Prediction With Edge Balancing Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14808)
*Chen-Hao Chang,Hui-Ju Hung,Chia-Hsun Lu,Chih-Ya Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel methodology, CoEBA, incorporating Edge Balancing Augmentation to improve contrastive learning for link prediction, addressing theoretical and practical weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in existing contrastive learning methods for link prediction, including lack of theoretical analysis and insufficient attention to node degree considerations.

Method: Develop a new graph augmentation method called Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), and combine it with newly designed contrastive losses in the proposed CoEBA framework.

Result: The experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show that CoEBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Conclusion: CoEBA provides a solution to the identified problems by enhancing contrastive learning performance through theoretical grounding and improved graph augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Nicolas Mayoraz,Steffen Rendle,Dima Kuzmin,Emil Praun,Berivan Isik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates enhancing the Successive Halving algorithm using learning curve predictions to optimize resource allocation in hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the drawback of the Successive Halving algorithm prematurely pruning promising candidates that perform poorly in early stages but improve significantly later.

Method: The authors guide the Successive Halving algorithm with learning curve predictions modeled based on Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes and assess its effectiveness via a large-scale study.

Result: The predictive approach demonstrated competitive performance but was found not to be Pareto optimal due to reliance on fully observed learning curves.

Conclusion: Leveraging existing learning curve data could mitigate the downside of requiring fully observed curves, offering possibilities to refine the predictive approach in the future.

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

### [232] [On Defining Neural Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14832)
*Su Hyeong Lee,Richard Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Amortized Model Ensembling (AME) to synthesize a single neural network by adapting pretrained models without using training data, outperforming individual models and previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of combining pretrained models trained on disjoint data shards without requiring access to the original training data.

Method: The method involves a data-free meta-optimization approach termed Amortized Model Ensembling (AME), which uses differences between model weights as pseudogradients to guide weight updates.

Result: AME results in neural network ensembles that outperform both individual experts and model soup baselines, especially in scenarios involving out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: AME provides a principled and generalizable framework for neural averaging, enabling adaptive and expressive strategies for combining pretrained models without data.

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

*Murat Isik,Mandeep Kaur Saggi,Humaira Gowher,Sabre Kais*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Quantum Machine Learning framework combining multiple biochemical data types to improve enzyme functionality prediction, achieving high accuracy and surpassing existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate enzyme functionality prediction, especially for enzymes with limited structural or sequence information, drives this study.

Method: A multimodal Quantum Machine Learning model leveraging protein sequences, quantum-derived data, molecular graphs, and 2D molecular images, integrated via Quantum Vision Transformer with specific encoders and fusion module.

Result: Attained a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming baseline methods focused solely on sequences and other existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures essential biochemical interactions, advancing enzyme functionality prediction methods and setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Accurately predicting enzyme functionality remains one of the major
challenges in computational biology, particularly for enzymes with limited
structural annotations or sequence homology. We present a novel multimodal
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC)
classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities:
protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular
graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision
Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a
unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind
enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model
achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a
substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other
QML models.

### [234] [Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models Using Exponentiated Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14853)
*Sajib Biswas,Mao Nishino,Samuel Jacob Chacko,Xiuwen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new optimization method for creating adversarial triggers to bypass safeguards in large language models (LLMs). The proposed technique improves attack efficiency and success rates compared to existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the vulnerability of LLMs to crafted adversarial attacks, especially given their increased deployment in critical applications.

Method: An intrinsic optimization approach was developed to optimize relaxed one-hot encodings of adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent and Bregman projection.

Result: The proposed method exhibited higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines when tested on multiple LLMs and adversarial datasets.

Conclusion: Optimized adversarial suffixes can successfully jailbreak multiple LLMs, showcasing the need for improved alignment and defense strategies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

*Jiafeng Xiong,Rizos Sakellariou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the GTGIB framework for effective temporal graph learning, combining Graph Structure Learning with a Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in representing unseen nodes and filtering noise in dynamic temporal graphs.

Method: The proposed method combines a two-step Graph Structure Learning structural enhancer and a Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck, with theoretical proofs and variational approximation for optimization.

Result: GTGIB is tested on four real-world datasets for link prediction and outperforms existing methods in both inductive and transductive settings.

Conclusion: GTGIB is a robust framework for enhancing temporal graph learning, offering consistent performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

### [236] [Squeezed Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14871)
*Jyotirmai Singh,Samar Khanna,James Burgess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which apply anisotropic noise scaling using the principal components of the training data, leading to substantial improvements in generative model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise, ignoring data structure, and the study is inspired by quantum squeezed states where uncertainty is redistributed along specific axes according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Method: The method involves developing SDM variants that scale noise anisotropically along the principal components of data. Two configurations are explored: scaling with compensation (Heisenberg model) and scaling without compensation (standard SDM).

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CelebA-64 datasets show that mild antisqueezing, where variance on the principal axis is increased, consistently improves FID scores by up to 15% and enhances precision-recall performance toward higher recall.

Conclusion: Data-driven noise shaping in diffusion models leads to enhanced generative performance without requiring changes to the underlying model architecture.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

*Preston Fu,Oleh Rybkin,Zhiyuan Zhou,Michal Nauman,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how to optimally allocate computational resources for value-based deep reinforcement learning methods, revealing critical insights into model size, batch size, and update-to-data ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods become computationally expensive, the study seeks to optimize compute usage for maximal performance, addressing the relative lack of research on scaling in RL compared to supervised learning.

Method: The study analyzes how fixed compute budgets should be divided across model capacity and update-to-data (UTD) ratio, and examines phenomena like TD-overfitting, where batch size impacts accuracy differently depending on model size.

Result: The research identifies TD-overfitting as a key factor that harms Q-function accuracy in smaller models with large batches, but disappears in larger models, enabling efficient scaling. Guidelines for compute-efficient configuration are provided.

Conclusion: The findings enrich understanding of compute scaling in deep RL, offering structured insights and actionable guidelines for compute-optimal scaling that parallel supervised learning adaptation strategies.

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

### [238] [Quantization Meets Spikes: Lossless Conversion in the First Timestep via Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14520)
*Hangming Zhang,Zheng Li,Qiang Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for nearly lossless and ultra-low latency ANN-to-SNN conversion using Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significant energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are computationally efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but existing ANN-to-SNN conversion methods struggle with achieving low latency without accuracy loss.

Method: The authors analyze information loss in quantization layers using information entropy and propose Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a tailored hyperparameter adjustment strategy for nearly lossless conversion.

Result: Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art accuracies (e.g. 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100, and 81.6% on ImageNet using ViT-S architecture) with only one timestep, achieving 5x energy savings.

Conclusion: The method provides efficient ANN-to-SNN conversion with ultra-low latency and establishes a new benchmark for accuracy and energy consumption benefits.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency
via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of
non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high
computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN
conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These
conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the
quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical
minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to
realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current
quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following
batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter
configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first
time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through
the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce
Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy
tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless
ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also
leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain
stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100
and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,
establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method
reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
compared to the baseline method.

*Ryan Tjoa,Poorva Garg,Harrison Goldstein,Todd Millstein,Benjamin Pierce,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automatic tuning approach for property-based testing (PBT) input generators to optimize random input distribution, using an innovative system called Loaded Dice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuning the weights of random choices in PBT input generators to achieve a desired distribution is a challenging, tedious process that limits the effectiveness and diversity of software validation.

Method: The authors develop a technique for automatic offline tuning by assigning symbolic weights to input generators and optimizing them using objective functions within the Loaded Dice discrete probabilistic programming system.

Result: The proposed approach efficiently optimizes input distributions and improves diversity and validity in test cases, providing a 3.1-7.4x bug-finding speedup on standard PBT benchmarks.

Conclusion: Automatic tuning of input generators significantly enhances the effectiveness of property-based testing by streamlining the generator-tuning process and improving test coverage and efficiency.

Abstract: Property-based testing validates software against an executable specification
by evaluating it on randomly generated inputs. The standard way that PBT users
generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs
through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users
must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual
random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose
individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so
today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be
practically achieved.
  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of
generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an
objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights
that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that
allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity
and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel
discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports
differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for
generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at
optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective
functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks,
demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the
generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.

*Ashish Mishra,Suresh Jagannathan*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper enhances Component-based Synthesis (CBS) by introducing a method to reason about logical similarities among execution paths using refinement-type specifications, improving the efficiency of CBS algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of CBS algorithms is hindered by stringent constraints, necessitating a method to efficiently handle such high precision requirements.

Method: The methodology involves using refinement-type specifications and a Qualified Tree Automata variant to record information about enumerated terms and reason about subtyping constraints among paths.

Result: The technique enables avoiding semantically similar paths while searching, significantly improving CBS capabilities for complex queries.

Conclusion: The proposed approach and its implementation, 
ame, surpass existing methods in synthesizing solutions for complex CBS queries, advancing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Component-based synthesis (CBS) aims to generate loop-free programs from a
set of libraries whose methods are annotated with specifications and whose
output must satisfy a set of logical constraints, expressed as a query. The
effectiveness of a CBS algorithm critically depends on the severity of the
constraints imposed by the query. The more exact these constraints are, the
sparser the space of feasible solutions. This maxim also applies when we enrich
the expressiveness of the specifications affixed to library methods. In both
cases, the search must now contend with constraints that may only hold over a
small number of the possible execution paths that can be enumerated by a CBS
procedure.
  In this paper, we address this challenge by equipping CBS search with the
ability to reason about logical similarities among the paths it explores. Our
setting considers library methods equipped with refinement-type specifications
that enrich ordinary base types with a set of rich logical qualifiers to
constrain the set of values accepted by that type. We perform a search over a
tree automata variant called Qualified Tree Automata that intelligently records
information about enumerated terms, leveraging subtyping constraints over the
refinement types associated with these terms to enable reasoning about
similarity among candidate solutions as search proceeds, thereby avoiding
exploration of semantically similar paths.
  We present an implementation of this idea in a tool called \name, and provide
a comprehensive evaluation that demonstrates \name's ability to synthesize
solutions to complex CBS queries that go well-beyond the capabilities of the
existing state-of-the-art.

*Zhanxi Xie,Baili Lu,Yanzhao Gu,Zikun Li,Junhao Wei,Ngai Cheong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced path planning algorithm (dRRT) for UAVs, achieving efficient and smooth trajectories in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As UAVs become integral to public management and urban governance, efficient path planning is crucial to address challenges like energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints.

Method: The study introduces dRRT, an improved version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm, with strategies like Target Bias, Dynamic Step Size, Detour Priority, and B-spline smoothing, tested via simulations in an urban environment.

Result: Simulations show dRRT outperforms traditional methods (RRT, A*, ACO), achieving 100% success rate, reduced runtime, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and smoother trajectories in urban scenarios.

Conclusion: dRRT illustrates significant potential in public management tasks, though limitations like computational overhead and local optima remain. Further integration with real-time obstacle frameworks is needed.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

*Pranay Dugar,Mohitvishnu S. Gadde,Jonah Siekmann,Yesh Godse,Aayam Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning method for humanoids to efficiently reach SE(2) target poses, outperforming traditional velocity-based methods in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and natural movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoids face challenges in efficiently executing short-range movements in real-world workspaces, requiring solutions for fast, robust, and energy-efficient locomotion.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach using a novel constellation-based reward function tailored for direct pose reaching in SE(2).

Result: The method demonstrated improved performance in energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count over established methods, including successful simulation-to-hardware transfer.

Conclusion: Target-oriented reward design is crucial for effective short-range humanoid locomotion, enabling advancements in practical application scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified optimization-based framework combining task and motion planning (TAMP) for humanoid robots, emphasizing contact mode changes to integrate locomotion and manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of integrated frameworks in humanoid robotics that simultaneously account for task-level planning and detailed motion dynamics, aiming to improve loco-manipulation capabilities.

Method: The approach defines contact mode changes as symbolic actions, enabling a unified planning process that considers task, motion, and whole-body dynamics with actuation constraints.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid platform demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, physically consistent loco-manipulation behaviors across long and complex action sequences.

Conclusion: The study achieves a significant milestone in humanoid robot planning by presenting the first integrated TAMP framework resolving acyclic planning and whole-body dynamics for loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

### [244] [Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100)
*Nilay Kushawaha,Carlo Alessi,Lorenzo Fruzzetti,Egidio Falotico*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning framework to effectively transfer control knowledge between different domains for soft robots with varying physical dynamics and materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots are inherently complex and their material properties degrade over time, making traditional analytical approaches ineffective for modeling their dynamics. Thus, there is a need for a method to transfer learned mappings across domains with different properties.

Method: The paper introduces a domain translation framework using a conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to adapt a pose controller from a simulation domain to a more physically complex domain, utilizing dynamic learning of input pressure signals and end-effector positions/orientations.

Result: The proposed method was tested on trajectory-tracking experiments across multiple shapes and assessed under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results showed effective cross-domain skill transfer and adaptability of the model.

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP facilitates knowledge transfer across domains, making robotic controllers more adaptable and generalizable for soft robots, even under challenging conditions like material degradation or increased viscosity.

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

*Jahid Chowdhury Choton,John Woods,William Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of multi-robot navigation in continuous spaces by proposing an efficient environment modeled as an MDP, showcasing its application with various RL methods and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of existing deep RL approaches used in multi-robot navigation, such as sample inefficiency, long training times, and lack of formal guarantees.

Method: The proposed method introduces a customizable environment for multi-robot navigation modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), optimized using various RL methods including gradient-based (A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC) and non-gradient-based (CrossQ, ARS) techniques. Real-world applicability was tested in a simulated agricultural setup.

Result: The paper demonstrates the viability of their environment and approach by achieving robust and efficient navigation in uncertain and continuous real-world-like settings, as tested in CoppeliaSim.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of developing MDP-based environments for real-world multi-robot navigation tasks and offers a framework for deploying RL methods effectively within constrained resources and time.

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

*Yuhang Lin,Yijia Xie,Jiahong Xie,Yuehao Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Jiajun Lv,Yukai Ma,Xingxing Zuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimGenHOI, a unified framework leveraging generative modeling and reinforcement learning to create realistic humanoid-object interactions with minimized artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid-object interaction (HOI) generation models often produce unrealistic outcomes, such as implausible contacts and unnatural motions, impairing their use in physical environments.

Method: SimGenHOI employs a generative model based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to predict key motions, integrates reinforcement learning for contact-aware motion tracking, and iteratively fine-tunes the generative model and control mechanism for improved realism.

Result: SimGenHOI demonstrates the ability to generate diverse, realistic, and physically plausible HOI motions with higher tracking success rates in simulations and better long-term manipulation capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework combines generative modeling and reinforcement learning effectively, resulting in improved physical plausibility and broader applicability for humanoid-object interaction tasks.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a lightweight Newton-Raphson flow-based tracking controller for blimps and quadrotors through real-world flight experiments, showing it performs well while being computationally efficient and energy-saving compared to traditional control frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the real-world applicability of a lightweight tracking controller which has theoretical performance guarantees but requires practical validation on aerial platforms.

Method: Real-world flight experiments on a miniature blimp and a mid-size quadrotor were conducted, comparing the Newton-Raphson flow-based controller with baseline methods like feedback linearization and nonlinear model predictive control, using metrics like trajectory error, computation time, and CPU energy usage.

Result: The Newton-Raphson flow-based controller demonstrated comparable or superior trajectory tracking performance while significantly reducing computation time and energy consumption compared to the baseline methods.

Conclusion: The lightweight tracking controller offers a practical, efficient, and effective solution for aerial vehicle control under computational constraints.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

*Omar Mostafa,Nikolaos Evangeliou,Anthony Tzes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a 2D exploration strategy for obstacle-rich planar spaces using a self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system equipped with sensors. The focus is on ensuring safety while exploring undetected regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in navigating cluttered 2D spaces with classical agents (with circular footprints) that cannot instantaneously adjust their pose, emphasizing the need for a safe and effective exploration strategy.

Method: The method involves a dual-wheeled differential drive system equipped with sensors like IMU, LiDAR, and RGB-D cameras. The system uses RTAB-SLAM for localization and relies on a safe skeleton-based approach to maintain a safe distance from obstacles while heading towards open spaces.

Result: Experimental studies using a ROS-enabled mobile agent demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed path planning and space exploration strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed exploration strategy successfully prioritizes safety by avoiding obstacles and ensuring efficient exploration of undetected spaces in a planar environment.

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

*Daegyun Choi,Alhim Vera,Donghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes using biological inspiration from animals like lizards, which exhibit mid-air righting reflexes, to inform control strategies for spacecraft-mounted robotic arms (SMSs), addressing dynamic coupling challenges in microgravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the difficulty of controlling space manipulator systems in microgravity, where dynamic interactions between the manipulator and its spacecraft base are hard to manage.

Method: The researchers analyzed lizards' mid-air righting trajectories captured via high-speed video and applied multi-objective optimization to extract key behavioral goals and motion characteristics. These insights were used to create reference trajectories for controlling SMSs.

Result: The study identified motion profiles inspired by lizards and demonstrated their feasibility as reference trajectories for SMS control, resulting in enhanced maneuverability and robustness.

Conclusion: Biological behaviors, such as the air-righting reflexes of animals, can be effectively translated into adaptive control strategies for improving the performance of robotic systems in space environments.

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

*Guodong Yao,Hao Wang,Qing Chang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) framework integrating adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence and a scan-to-submap strategy to address LiDAR feature degeneracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR feature degeneracy poses challenges to accurate localization and mapping in complex environments, necessitating methods to enhance reliable state estimation.

Method: An adaptive outlier-removal mechanism adjusts thresholds dynamically based on sensor distance and platform motion. A scan-to-submap registration strategy using IMU data and a weighting matrix incorporating IMU covariance and degeneration metrics are introduced.

Result: Extensive experiments in varied indoor and outdoor degenerate feature environments show the proposed method's superior robustness and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The enhanced LIO framework effectively addresses feature degeneracy, improving localization and mapping performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DTWIL, a method to handle Action-Constrained Imitation Learning (ACIL) by addressing occupancy measure mismatches through trajectory alignment using Model Predictive Control and Dynamic Time Warping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to ensure safe behaviors in robotics, focusing on a learning problem where an imitator with limited actions learns from an expert with a larger action space.

Method: The proposed DTWIL method generates surrogate datasets by aligning trajectory data using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to match expert behaviors under action constraints. This is achieved through Model Predictive Control.

Result: DTWIL demonstrates superior performance and sample efficiency in robot control tasks compared to other imitation learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DTWIL effectively solves action-constrained learning challenges and enhances learning performance in robotics, making it a valuable tool for safe and efficient control systems.

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

*Nicole Fronda,Phil Smith,Bardh Hoxha,Yash Pant,Houssam Abbas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fair-CoPlan, a semi-distributed flight planner for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ensuring fairness in flight paths while resolving conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fairness issue in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) where different UAS operators with potentially competing goals need to share urban airspace efficiently.

Method: Proposes a three-step semi-distributed flight planning process where take-off and landing choices are constrained, operators plan independently under these constraints, and conflicts are resolved with fairness optimization.

Result: Simulation experiments showed that Fair-CoPlan produces fairer flight paths compared to non-fair planners with only minor trade-offs in delays.

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan encourages broader UAM participation, maintains safety, and offers practical flexibility to operators through fair conflict resolution.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness in resource usage during multi-robot motion planning, particularly concerning energy expenditure.

Method: Develop a distributed fair motion planner and combine it with safe controllers to create the FiReFly algorithm.

Result: Simulated cases show improved fairness in energy usage and higher mission success rates compared to non-fair planners. Real-time performance achievable for 15 UAVs, scaling to 50 UAVs with trade-offs.

Conclusion: FiReFly demonstrates that fairness can coexist with mission success, offering scalable solutions for multi-robot operations.

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve offline imitation learning (IL) under constraints of limited expert data by pre-training dynamics representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline imitation learning often suffers due to the restricted availability of expert data, hampering scalability.

Method: The paper includes a pre-training phase to learn dynamics representations using a theoretical foundation and inspired by noise contrastive estimation, utilizing non-expert data for better performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrated effective policy mimicry in simulated environments with minimal trajectories and successful real-world applications on quadrupeds.

Conclusion: Introducing pre-trained dynamics representations makes offline IL more data-efficient and scalable, utilizing non-expert data to address bottlenecks.

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

TL;DR: The paper presents DEXTER-LLM, a framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and model-based optimization for dynamic and explainable multi-robot task planning in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online multi-robot coordination encounters challenges in dynamic, unknown environments, particularly with tasks triggered by detected features. Previous LLM-based approaches lack adaptability and explainability, necessitating a new solution.

Method: The framework integrates four modules: (i) mission comprehension for ordering tasks, (ii) LLM-based subtask generation for task decomposition, (iii) search-based optimal subtask assignment and scheduling, and (iv) dynamic adaptation with human-in-the-loop verification for handling new tasks.

Result: Experimental evaluations show 100% success rates, three times baseline task completion, 62% fewer LLM queries during adaptation, and twice the quality of plans for compound tasks.

Conclusion: DEXTER-LLM successfully combines LLM reasoning capabilities with model-based optimization to address online adaptability and explainability in multi-robot task planning in unknown environments.

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics struggles with dexterous in-hand manipulation due to the complexity of dynamics and limited sensing fusion approaches, necessitating a framework integrating vision and tactile data.

Method: FBI incorporates a dynamics-aware latent model with a transformer-based interaction module, fusing tactile and visual features, and training a diffusion-based policy for execution.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FBI outperforms existing methods across multiple manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The FBI framework effectively addresses adaptability challenges in robotic in-hand manipulation tasks by combining dynamic tactile-motion fusion with visual inputs.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Conclusion: By leveraging a hybrid method integrating teleoperation and LfD with sensitivity to task characteristics and scoring, the solution demonstrated superior performance, securing the first place in the competition.

Abstract: This technical report presents the champion solution of the Table Service
Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a
series of demanding tasks under strict requirements for speed, precision, and
reliability: unfolding a tablecloth (deformable-object manipulation), placing a
pizza onto the table (pick-and-place), and opening and closing a food container
with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated
demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating
scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the
first place in the competition.

inclination), integrating a LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) system and a
hierarchical trajectory-yaw optimization algorithm. The hardware innovation
enables constraint enhancement via dense ground point cloud acquisition and
forward environmental awareness for dynamic obstacle detection. A

environment, balancing environmental exploration, target tracking precision,
and energy efficiency. Physical experiments demonstrate 81% tracking error
reduction, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift
across indoor maze and 60-meter-scale outdoor scenarios. This work proposes a
hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, offering a robust solution for UAV
autonomy in post-disaster search and rescue missions. We will release our

deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided
hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance.
In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical

TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

*João Vitor de Carvalho Silva,Douglas G. Macharet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in facilitating multi-agent collaboration for victim rescue tasks, evaluating their performance using coordination-specific metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can support effective multi-agent collaboration in solving complex coordination problems, particularly in structured victim rescue tasks.

Method: The study uses LLM agents in a graph-based environment to perform a victim rescue task requiring division of labor, prioritization, and cooperative planning. Performance is evaluated with metrics such as task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency.

Result: LLMs showed both strengths and weaknesses in coordination-sensitive metrics, providing insights into their capabilities and failure modes in multi-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to future benchmarks and architectural improvements for using LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaborative tasks.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

*Sanjeev Ramkumar Sudha,Marija Popović,Erlend M. Coates*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper focuses on efficient target tracking of moving objects in dynamic environments using a mobile robot platform, proposing a framework that improves prediction and path planning for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to automate crucial tasks like environmental monitoring, targeting scenarios like search and rescue or pollutant cleanups, where tracking is complicated by dynamic conditions such as environmental disturbances.

Method: The paper introduces an informative path planning framework combining a spatiotemporal prediction network to predict moving target positions over time and an adaptive planning objective tailored for dynamic environments.

Result: Simulation experiments confirm that the proposed framework improves tracking performance over methods relying solely on entropy reduction, and field tests validate its effectiveness in real-world monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: The study shows that combining spatiotemporal predictions with adaptive planning significantly enhances the tracking of moving targets in complex, dynamic settings using mobile robot platforms.

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

*Alexander Raab,Stephan Weiss,Alessandro Fornasier,Christian Brommer,Abdalrahman Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF) for improving consistency and accuracy in terrestrial vehicle localization, reducing dimensionality and accommodating diverse sensor setups without parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in consistency and long-term accuracy of traditional Extended Kalman Filters in terrestrial vehicle localization.

Method: The M-ESEKF represents the robot's pose in reduced dimensionality while introducing a correction scheme that incorporates domain knowledge into sensor data. It integrates seamlessly into modular state estimation frameworks.

Result: Through Monte Carlo simulations, the M-ESEKF demonstrated better consistency and stability compared to classical filters, while supporting diverse scenarios and sensor configurations.

Conclusion: The M-ESEKF's improved filter performance, reduced need for parameter tuning, and adaptability to real-world settings make it a significant contribution to vehicle localization systems.

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

*Sagar Parekh,Casey Grothoff,Ryan Wright,Robin White,Dylan P. Losey*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework aimed at improving the safety and transparency of general-purpose robots in the meat processing industry to address labor shortages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labor shortages in the meat processing sector need to be mitigated, and there is a gap in cost-effective, flexible robotic solutions that can safely work alongside humans.

Method: The framework includes safety measures like a hand-detection system and a force-sensing instrumented knife, alongside transparency tools like LEDs signaling uncertainty and a graphical interface sharing robotic plans.

Result: A user study validated that the proposed framework enhances safety and transparency in collaborative human-robot meat processing environments.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key challenges in meat processing robotics by ensuring safety, maintaining human-in-the-loop interaction, and improving collaborative efficiency.

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.

*Yutong Bian,Xianhao Lin,Yupeng Xie,Tianyang Liu,Mingchen Zhuge,Siyuan Lu,Haoming Tang,Jinlin Wang,Jiayi Zhang,Jiaqi Chen,Xiangru Tang,Yongxin Ni,Sirui Hong,Chenglin Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RealDevWorld, an evaluation framework for testing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate production-ready software, featuring a diverse benchmark and automated assessment system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for software generation by LLMs focus on static and binary checks, which fail to evaluate interactive behaviors and runtime dynamics essential for real-world usability.

Method: The method comprises RealDevBench, a set of 194 diverse software engineering tasks, and AppEvalPilot, an agent-based evaluation system mimicking realistic GUI-based interactions to assess software correctness, visuals, and runtime behavior.

Result: RealDevWorld demonstrates a high accuracy of 0.92 and a strong correlation of 0.85 with expert human evaluations, significantly reducing the need for manual review.

Conclusion: RealDevWorld effectively enables scalable and human-aligned evaluation of production-level software created by LLMs, pushing the boundaries of automated and nuanced software assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

### [265] [Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback for Code Writing Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14114)
*Aditey Nandan,Viraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an assistive system for resolving task specification ambiguities in code writing using a feedback-driven technique called ARHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous natural language specifications can make software development challenging, requiring programmers to clarify and resolve ambiguities to ensure accurate code implementation.

Method: The ARHF system identifies ambiguous inputs, collects feedback on the desired behavior for those inputs, and uses this feedback to generate unambiguous, accurate code.

Result: The prototype system was tested to demonstrate its effectiveness, and its impact on enhancing programming practices was explored.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for such systems to improve programmer efficiency and facilitate better learning in Computer Science education.

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural
language and may be ambiguous. Programmers must therefore develop the ability
to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

*Yewei Song,Tiezhu Sun,Xunzhu Tang,Prateek Rajput,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods for assessing the consistency and robustness of code generation by large language models using abstract syntax tree (AST)-based structural entropy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for reliable evaluation tools to measure the stability of code generated by large language models within real-world software development.

Method: The technique pairs entropy concepts with AST analysis, deriving metrics such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and Structural Cross-Entropy ratio to assess stability. These methods analyze depth-bounded subtrees in generated programs and are reference-free, language-agnostic, and execution-independent.

Result: The approach benchmarks leading LLMs, showcasing that AST-driven structural entropy can reveal subtleties in model performance, far beyond the capabilities of traditional metrics like pass@k or CodeBLEU.

Conclusion: AST-based structural entropy metrics are lightweight, efficient, and offer a nuanced addition to evaluating code generation, emphasizing independence from external references or executions.

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

*Scott Blyth,Sherlock A. Licorish,Christoph Treude,Markus Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in code generation but are primarily assessed on functional correctness alone. This paper proposes using static analysis-driven feedback to enhance multidimensional code quality via an iterative prompting algorithm, achieving significant improvements in security, readability, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code generation benchmarks mostly focus on functional correctness, overlooking deeper aspects of code quality like security, reliability, readability, and maintainability.

Method: The authors introduced a PythonSecurityEval benchmark and utilized an iterative prompting technique with static analysis tools (Bandit and Pylint) to identify and resolve various code quality issues in the outputs of LLMs.

Result: Experiments using GPT-4o showed substantial improvements in code quality across dimensions: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability violations went down from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings decreased from >50% to 11% after ten iterations.

Conclusion: Static analysis-driven feedback significantly enhances the multidimensional code quality generated by LLMs, proving that these models can be optimized effectively beyond functional correctness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, achieving high scores on benchmarks such as HumanEval and
MBPP. However, these benchmarks primarily assess functional correctness and
neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability,
readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using
the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static
analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to
identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show
substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability
violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within
ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static
analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional
correctness.

*Eagon Meng,Daniel Jackson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structural pattern for software development emphasizing legibility and modularity to address limitations of current software and leverage LLM coders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of legibility and modularity in current software development results in challenges such as reduced incrementality, integrity, and transparency, necessitating an overhaul in software structure.

Method: The authors introduce a model based on concepts and synchronizations (independent services and event-based rules), supported by a domain-specific language for declarative delineation of features that can be generated by LLMs. They test this approach using the RealWorld benchmark.

Result: Using the RealWorld benchmark, the proposed structural pattern demonstrated enhanced legibility and modularity, simplifying feature expression and integration.

Conclusion: The structural pattern improves software robustness by making incremental changes, maintaining integrity, and increasing transparency through a modular and legible approach.

Abstract: The opportunities offered by LLM coders (and their current limitations)
demand a reevaluation of how software is structured. Software today is often
"illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed
behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key
requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small
increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior
increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and
what actions have happened at runtime).
  A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its
elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and
event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for
synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and
declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the
RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.

*Zhongyi Wang,Tengjie Lin,Mingshuai Chen,Mingqi Yang,Haokun Li,Xiao Yi,Shengchao Qin,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Preguss is a framework that uses LLMs and static analysis to automate generating and refining formal specifications for large-scale program verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated verification of large-scale systems is challenging due to the limitations of LLMs, such as context-length constraints and difficulty in creating complex specifications.

Method: Preguss combines static analysis and deductive verification, leveraging runtime error-guided unit prioritization and LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications.

Result: Preguss provides a modular approach that synergizes components to improve automation in the verification process.

Conclusion: Preguss offers a promising pathway to advancing the automated verification of complex, large-scale programs.

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is
arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have
recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in
formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to
deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length
limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex,
interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular,
fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal
specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive
verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error
(RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii)
LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We
envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated
verification of large-scale programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and archaic methods associated with manual debugging, particularly in complex distributed software systems.

Method: Utilize generative AI to process system data, interface information, and documentation, producing natural-language explanations that guide developers in debugging.

Result: A demonstrator web application was created, showcasing the approach on a Java-based system, which provides explanations to enhance developer understanding.

Conclusion: The approach reduces the need for detailed system familiarity, improves debugging efficiency, and is accessible as an open-source tool.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

*Dennis Schiese,Aleksandr Perevalov,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach to explain the behavior of component-based Question Answering (QA) systems by analyzing input and output data flows, leveraging both template-based and LLM-generated methods, with LLMs outperforming templates according to user evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of software systems, particularly AI-driven QA systems, makes it challenging for developers and users to interpret and justify decisions, necessitating better explainability mechanisms.

Method: The method involves analyzing component input-output data flows (SPARQL queries as inputs and RDF triples as outputs) and generating explanations using template-based settings and various configurations of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: The study shows that LLM-generated explanations achieve high quality and outperform template-based methods based on user ratings.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances the explainability of QA system components by enabling humans to understand their behavior and decisions through automatically generated LLM explanations in the context of RDF and SPARQL.

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal systems lack appropriate languages and methods to effectively specify user requirements, posing challenges in developing systems that truly meet user needs.

Method: The authors propose MERLAN, a DSL with metamodels and ANTLR-based textual syntax to define multimodal interaction requirements. A prototype tool is provided to assist in generating compliant implementations.

Result: MERLAN enables requirements engineers to specify multimodal system requirements and automatically generate system implementations meeting those requirements.

Conclusion: MERLAN offers a solution for addressing the specification gap in multimodal systems, bridging requirements definition and implementation.

Abstract: Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio,

the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily
define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions,
potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an
open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse
nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced
systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs.
  In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We
present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax
implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements
engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible
implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework
is also provided.

### [274] [The Hidden Cost of Readability: How Code Formatting Silently Consumes Your LLM Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13666)
*Dangfeng Pan,Zhensu Sun,Cenyuan Zhang,David Lo,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of code formatting on the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) and demonstrates that removing non-essential formatting improves efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to assess whether code formatting elements, such as indentation and newlines designed for human readability, are essential for LLMs, and explore if they can be removed to reduce computational costs.

Method: The authors conduct an empirical study using Fill-in-the-Middle code completion tasks across four programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C#) and ten LLMs. They analyze token count and performance with and without code formatting and apply prompting and fine-tuning techniques.

Result: The study finds that removing formatting elements reduces input token counts by 24.5% on average and output token length by up to 36.1% without compromising performance. This optimization improves LLM efficiency.

Conclusion: Code format removal is a practical strategy for enhancing LLM efficiency. The authors provide a bidirectional code transformation tool to safeguard both human readability and model performance in real-world workflows.

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

### [275] [Assessing the Quality and Security of AI-Generated Code: A Quantitative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14727)
*Abbas Sabra,Olivier Schmitt,Joseph Tyler*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates the code quality and security of five Large Language Models (LLMs) by testing 4,442 Java coding solutions using SonarQube for static analysis, revealing systemic defects and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate software defects, particularly bugs and vulnerabilities, in LLM-generated code, and to assess systemic limitations of current LLM code generation methods.

Method: Analyzed LLM outputs from 4,442 Java assignments using SonarQube to identify software defects such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Result: LLMs showed functional code capabilities but introduced systemic issues including hard-coded passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, and no correlation was found between functional performance and code quality/security.

Conclusion: Static analysis tools like SonarQube are essential for detecting defects in LLM-generated code, highlighting its necessity before production use and revealing shared weaknesses across multiple models.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

TL;DR: The paper highlights 17 challenges in vehicle verification and validation through a workshop and survey with experts, proposing solutions and next research steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety and coverage in vehicle simulations is complex and requires novel insights and solutions.

Method: A workshop for brainstorming with experts was held, followed by a survey to consolidate findings and identify roadblocks.

Result: Experts identified 17 challenges, with many having known solutions, though resource utilization emerged as a critical need.

Conclusion: Focus now shifts to unresolved challenges to guide the research community towards impactful next steps.

Abstract: Verification and validation of vehicles is a complex yet critical process,
particularly for ensuring safety and coverage through simulations. However,
achieving realistic and useful simulations comes with significant challenges.
To explore these challenges, we conducted a workshop with experts in the field,
allowing them to brainstorm key obstacles. Following this, we distributed a
survey to consolidate findings and gain further insights into potential
solutions. The experts identified 17 key challenges, along with proposed
solutions, an assessment of whether they represent next steps for research, and
the roadblocks to their implementation. While a lack of resources was not
initially highlighted as a major challenge, utilizing more resources emerged as
a critical necessity when experts discussed solutions. Interestingly, we
expected some of these challenges to have already been addressed or to have
systematic solutions readily available, given the collective expertise in the
field. Many of the identified problems already have known solutions, allowing
us to shift focus towards unresolved challenges and share the next steps with
the broader community.

### [277] [Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection for Electroencephalogram: A Task-Independent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14060)
*Kartik Pandey,Arun Balasubramanian,Debasis Samanta*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), a novel method for selecting EEG channels using the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC), achieving performance improvements while being task-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead in high-density EEG systems, and to create a task-agnostic method for channel selection.

Method: Proposes the ACCS method, which uses the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to rank and select the most useful EEG channels for diverse applications.

Result: ACCS improves multi-class classification accuracy by up to 34.97% and identifies a reusable, task-independent set of informative channels.

Conclusion: The ACCS method enhances the adaptability and performance of EEG-based BCIs, making it broadly suitable for various applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.

*Takeshi Kobayashi,Shogo Yonekura,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study explores how varying motor neuron configurations and synaptic connections impacts learning in artificial systems, finding critical parameters that dictate learning success or failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why spike-based control signals hinder learning in artificial sensor-motor systems and how these limitations can be overcome or understood.

Method: The researchers developed a system that alters the number of independent synaptic bundles connecting sensors to motors and analyzed its effects on learning outcomes.

Result: Learning reliability is dependent on the balance between motor neuron numbers and synaptic bundles; certain configurations lead to either a collapse or acceleration of learning processes, explained by weight update patterns.

Conclusion: By identifying critical parameter ranges, the paper sheds light on the challenges and opportunities for implementing spike-based learning systems to explore neuronal functions effectively.

Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile
movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in
artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We
developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic
bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following
four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the
number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The
probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor
neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons
leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the
opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these
results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the
parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will
make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously
inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

Motivation: To explore the neurobiological differences associated with prompt engineering expertise in interacting with large language models (LLMs).

Method: A cross-sectional fMRI study comparing the brain functional connectivity and network activity between expert and intermediate prompt engineers.

Result: Experts showed increased connectivity in the left middle temporal gyrus and left frontal pole, along with altered power-frequency dynamics in key cognitive networks.

Conclusion: The study highlights unique neural activity linked to prompt engineering proficiency, contributing to natural language processing by aligning AI development with human cognition.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective
interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and
neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper
presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating
differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between
experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural
signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including
increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle
temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency
dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into
the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the
implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with
LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to
cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of
AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This
interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and
machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and
adapt to complex AI systems.

### [280] [Comparing Model-agnostic Feature Selection Methods through Relative Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14268)
*Chenghui Zheng,Garvesh Raskutti*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study compares feature selection methods, mainly Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO), in model-agnostic settings, showing GCM's superior efficiency under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is a crucial step in predictive modeling, especially in a model-agnostic context. Existing methods, while effective, often face challenges like computational intensity. This study aims to evaluate and compare two promising methods, GCM and LOCO, to improve efficiency.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze GCM and LOCO under three model settings: linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models, complemented by simulations and real-world data involving machine learning techniques such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees.

Result: The comparative analysis reveals that GCM-related methods generally achieve better results compared to LOCO, under defined regularity conditions, and the study quantifies their asymptotic relative efficiency.

Conclusion: GCM is presented as a more efficient feature selection method than LOCO in several contexts, supported by both theoretical findings and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an
ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used
because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally
intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the
Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)
estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In
particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings:
linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a
single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and
real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings,
demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable
regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative
efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include
widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient
boosting trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient approach to optimize hyperparameters for the lasso model using leave-one-out cross-validation.

Method: The algorithm calculates a piecewise quadratic representation of leave-one-out cross-validation tailored for the lasso model.

Result: The proposed algorithm is capable of finding exact hyperparameters for global or local optimization on real-world data sets.

Conclusion: This algorithm effectively demonstrates its practicality and precision by validating its hyperparameter optimization approach on real-world data.

Abstract: I develop an algorithm to produce the piecewise quadratic that computes

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper discusses inconsistencies in C-index implementations across R and Python software, affecting model evaluation for time-to-event outcomes. It highlights sources of variation, provides examples, and promotes better reporting for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in the calculation of C-index across software implementations, which hinder model reproducibility and fair comparisons.

Method: Analyzed different C-index estimators and their implementations in R and Python, focusing on survival models and the factors causing variability in results, such as tie handling and censoring.

Result: Identified significant variations in C-index results due to differences in software handling and input conventions. Demonstrated these effects using breast cancer data and semi-synthetic examples.

Conclusion: Greater transparency and standardized reporting are needed to mitigate inconsistencies in C-index calculations across software, ensuring reproducibility and fair model comparisons.

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event
outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the
context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely
used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of
machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index
estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence
of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly
equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine
reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key
variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.
Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from
survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on
input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when
quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox
proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available
breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need
for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article
aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,
providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing
software. All code is publicly available at:

Result: A structured framework is presented that aids researchers in conducting ethical assessments of their projects.

Conclusion: The paper intends to empower research teams to confidently meet ethics mandates with practical tools and examples.

Abstract: Stakeholder-based ethics analysis is now a formal requirement for submissions
to top cybersecurity research venues. This requirement reflects a growing
consensus that cybersecurity researchers must go beyond providing capabilities
to anticipating and mitigating the potential harms thereof. However, many
cybersecurity researchers may be uncertain about how to proceed in an ethics
analysis. In this guide, we provide practical support for that requirement by
enumerating stakeholder types and mapping them to common empirical research

TL;DR: The paper introduces DA-MTL, a multi-task framework for both detecting AI-generated text and attributing authorship to specific LLM sources, showing strong performance across languages and robustness against adversarial techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure security and integrity by addressing challenges in distinguishing AI-generated content and identifying its LLM source, with a focus beyond English.

Method: Develop and evaluate DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that jointly handles text detection and authorship attribution using datasets and backbone models.

Result: DA-MTL performs effectively across nine datasets, multiple languages, and various LLM sources, offering robustness against obfuscation and shedding light on cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns.

Conclusion: The insights and findings of DA-MTL provide important contributions to understanding and generalizing detection and attribution in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MultiFuzz proposes a novel multi-agent fuzzing framework using dense retrieval and modular, semantic-aware agents to overcome limitations in existing tools like ChatAFL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fuzzing tools struggle with understanding complex protocol grammars and rely too much on rigid mutation and unreliable outputs from large language models.

Method: MultiFuzz employs a multi-agent system enhanced by semantic-aware dense retrieval mechanisms. Protocol documentation is embedded in a vector database to facilitate reasoning and strategy adaptation.

Result: Experimental tests on the RTSP protocol show that MultiFuzz outperforms SOTA fuzzers in branch coverage and exploration of protocol states and transitions.

Conclusion: MultiFuzz demonstrates significant improvements in protocol fuzzing efficiency and opens the door for advanced agentic-based fuzzing approaches in the future.

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based
systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of
complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,
such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol
fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider
exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like
unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about
protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense
retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by
integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and
structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of
protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database
for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to
generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating
protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic
constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups
of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically
adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.
Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate
that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper
protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as
NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic
coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new
paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible
foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCFC, a defense framework aimed at mitigating jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) using a dual-track method that improves robustness and reduces attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerabilities and threats posed by jailbreak attacks to ensure safer deployment of LLMs.

Method: Proposes CCFC, which operates via two tracks: a core-only track for ignoring adversarial content and a core-full-core (CFC) track to counter structural vulnerabilities. It employs a safety consistency check across both tracks to finalize responses.

Result: CCFC reduces the attack success rate by 50-75% against strong adversaries while maintaining high fidelity for benign queries.

Conclusion: CCFC is a practical, effective framework for enhancing the safety of LLMs, outperforming existing defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a
dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs'
vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.
CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer
LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Explores vulnerabilities of machine learning models for credit card fraud detection (CCFD) against adversarial attacks, showing potential threats in financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models used in credit card fraud detection (CCFD) may have latent vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, posing risks to the financial industry's security and stability.

Method: This paper employs gradient-based attack methods to study adversarial vulnerabilities in tabular credit card transaction data, across both black-box and white-box attack settings.

Result: Findings reveal that ML models for tabular data are susceptible to adversarial perturbations, and adversarial samples can transfer across gradient-based and non-gradient-based models.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of robust security measures for ML-based CCFD systems to mitigate adversarial threats and enhance trustworthiness in financial applications.

Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine
Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent
transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have
demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with
the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in
computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly
those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These
latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability
of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses
could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic
framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial
perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based
attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data
in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm
that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the
need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners
regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments
by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to
non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate
that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing
robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module on the fly. Each partial ASR
hypothesis queries a vector store of audio-text pairs and domain terms, and the
retrieved results are fused with the live ASR hypotheses to fix recognition
errors. The fused hypotheses are passed to the LLM, yielding improved
responses.

*Jaskaran Singh,Amartya Roy Chowdhury,Raghav Prabhakar,Varshul C. W*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: MahaTTS-v2 is a multilingual, multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model designed specifically for Indic languages, leveraging 20K hours of focused training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of attention to Indic languages in existing TTS models, which predominantly focus on English and European languages, limiting accessibility.

Method: The method involves using Wav2Vec2.0 for semantic extraction, a Language Model (LM) for text-to-semantic modeling, and a Conditional Flow Model (CFM) for generating melspectograms from semantics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that MahaTTS-v2 outperforms other frameworks in multilingual expressive capabilities for Indic languages.

Conclusion: MahaTTS-v2 provides a significant advancement in multilingual TTS systems for Indic languages, enhancing language accessibility and expressiveness.

Abstract: Current Text-to-Speech models pose a multilingual challenge, where most of
the models traditionally focus on English and European languages, thereby
hurting the potential to provide access to information to many more people. To
address this gap, we introduce MahaTTS-v2 a Multilingual Multi-speaker
Text-To-Speech (TTS) system that has excellent multilingual expressive
capabilities in Indic languages. The model has been trained on around 20K hours
of data specifically focused on Indian languages. Our approach leverages
Wav2Vec2.0 tokens for semantic extraction, and a Language Model (LM) for
text-to-semantic modeling. Additionally, we have used a Conditional Flow Model
(CFM) for semantics to melspectogram generation. The experimental results
indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over other frameworks. Our

### [291] [Towards Low-Latency Tracking of Multiple Speakers With Short-Context Speaker Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14115)
*Taous Iatariene,Alexandre Guérin,Romain Serizel*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes a knowledge distillation (KD) training approach to enhance short-context speaker embeddings for identity reassignment in tracking systems, focusing on reducing overlap in speaker mixtures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speaker embedding extractors struggle with short temporal contexts and overlapping speech, making long-term identity reassignment necessary but prone to errors. The paper aims to improve on this by addressing the challenges of short-context embedding extraction and overlap.

Method: The authors use a KD-based training approach for short temporal contexts in speaker embedding extraction, leveraging beamforming to reduce overlap. Identity reassignment is studied on fixed-size blocks to enable low-latency tracking.

Result: The proposed models are effective in extracting short-context embeddings and are more robust to overlapping speech. However, blockwise reassignment requires additional research for better handling of simultaneous speech.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising solution to improve speaker embedding extraction but highlights the need for further advances in managing simultaneous speech during identity reassignment.

Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance
the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its
spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker
embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and
overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit
longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking
system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To
address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach
for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We
leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming
to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment
over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards
a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that
our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and
more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that
further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.

### [292] [EmoSLLM: Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of LLMs for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14130)
*Hugo Thimonier,Antony Perzo,Renaud Seguier*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper fine-tunes a Large Language Model (LLM) with audio and text data to predict emotions efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion recognition methods struggle to combine linguistic and paralinguistic information effectively, and leveraging LLMs for multimodal tasks presents promising opportunities.

Method: The approach extracts audio features, maps them into the LLM's space with a learnable module, combines text inputs and prompts, and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: The method outperforms most existing speech-text emotion recognition models and uses fewer parameters, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This novel fusion of audio and text with an LLM is effective for emotion recognition and sets a benchmark for computationally efficient multimodal processing.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing
both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in
human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have
highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks
outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches
have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained
backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach
that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion
prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature
extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a
learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio
features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the
transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.
To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental
results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model
outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while
requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This
highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for
speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational
efficiency.

### [293] [A Study of the Scale Invariant Signal to Distortion Ratio in Speech Separation with Noisy References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14623)
*Simon Dahl Jepsen,Mads Græsbøll Christensen,Jesper Rindom Jensen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of SI-SDR in speech separation models trained with noisy references. Adjustments to the training data improve noise reduction but can introduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the limitations and effects of using SI-SDR for training and evaluating speech separation models when training references contain noise.

Method: The authors derive the SI-SDR with noisy references and propose a method to enhance training references and augment datasets using WHAM!.

Result: Models trained on enhanced datasets show reduced noise in separated speech but exhibit quality limitations due to potential artifacts.

Conclusion: SI-SDR's performance is inherently constrained by the noise in references, and while enhanced methods improve noise reduction, they risk reducing overall quality.

Abstract: This paper examines the implications of using the Scale-Invariant
Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) as both evaluation and training objective
in supervised speech separation, when the training references contain noise, as
is the case with the de facto benchmark WSJ0-2Mix. A derivation of the SI-SDR
with noisy references reveals that noise limits the achievable SI-SDR, or leads
to undesired noise in the separated outputs. To address this, a method is
proposed to enhance references and augment the mixtures with WHAM!, aiming to
train models that avoid learning noisy references. Two models trained on these
enhanced datasets are evaluated with the non-intrusive NISQA.v2 metric. Results
show reduced noise in separated speech but suggest that processing references
may introduce artefacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation
is found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness across models on the WSJ0-2Mix
and Libri2Mix test sets, underlining the conclusion from the derivation.

*Running Zhao,Zhihan Jiang,Xinchen Zhang,Chirui Chang,Handi Chen,Weipeng Deng,Luyao Jin,Xiaojuan Qi,Xun Qian,Edith C. H. Ngai*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: NoteIt is a system developed to automatically convert instructional videos into interactive, customizable notes while preserving hierarchical and multimodal information effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current automated note-generation tools, which fail to comprehensively preserve video information and lack adaptable formats and interactivity.

Method: The authors designed NoteIt, a system with a unique pipeline to extract hierarchical structures and multimodal content from instructional videos, allowing customizable note creation and interactive interfaces for users.

Result: Technical evaluations and a user study (N=36) showed strong performance based on objective metrics, as well as positive user feedback on usability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: NoteIt effectively converts instructional videos into high-quality, interactive, and customizable notes, solving usability gaps in existing solutions.

Abstract: Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later
without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to
obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing
research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in
the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations
for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes
digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically
converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that
faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from
videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further
customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their
preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user
study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user
feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall
usability of NoteIt. Project website: https://zhaorunning.github.io/NoteIt/

*Haojun Zhuang,Dünya Baradari,Nataliya Kosmyna,Arnav Balyan,Constanze Albrecht,Stephanie Chen,Pattie Maes*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines confusion during reading using EEG and eye tracking, achieving higher accuracy in detecting confusion when combining both modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans experience confusion due to conflicts between new information and prior knowledge, posing a challenge for learning.

Method: Researchers used EEG and eye tracking on 11 participants reading diverse paragraphs, isolating the N400 ERP, and applied machine learning to analyze multimodal data.

Result: Multimodal models improved classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal models, with the highest accuracy of 89.6%, showcasing the brain's temporal regions in confusion detection.

Conclusion: Findings suggest potential for wearable brain-computer interfaces in real-time monitoring and adaptive systems for personalized learning and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text
media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with
chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or
exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for
learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of
reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and
gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from
diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential
(ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and
integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed
analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during
naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG +
eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal
baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a
best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's
temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues
for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time
monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems
that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential
applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and
accessibility.

*Lixiang Yan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes the APCP framework outlining four escalating levels of AI agency in education, moving from adaptive tools to collaborative partners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a conceptual framework for understanding, designing, and evaluating agentic AI in collaborative educational settings.

Method: Proposes the APCP framework based on sociocultural theories and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), defining four levels of AI agency in learning environments.

Result: AI can be functional collaborators but not phenomenological partners, which can reshape the design of learning environments and influence pedagogy.

Conclusion: The APCP framework emphasizes designing learning environments leveraging human-AI collaboration, recognizing AI's complementary strengths despite its lack of consciousness.

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid
transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool
towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This
shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of
proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual
framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI
interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel
conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as
a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of
escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an
Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a
Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural
theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this
framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and
responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a
critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,
examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared
intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while
AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed
as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant
implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda
for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning
environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

### [297] [A High Performance GPU CountSketch Implementation and Its Application to Multisketching and Least Squares Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14209)
*Andrew J. Higgins,Erik G. Boman,Ichitaro Yamazaki*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient GPU implementation of CountSketch for multisketching and demonstrates its application in a faster least squares solver with better numerical stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-performance implementations of CountSketch for dimensionality reduction and multisketching.

Method: The authors developed a GPU-based implementation of CountSketch and applied it to multisketching tasks, including solving least squares problems.

Result: Their approach achieves up to 77% faster solutions than normal equations, with significantly improved numerical stability but a minor distortion in the residual norm.

Conclusion: The proposed GPU implementation enables efficient dimensionality reduction and numerical advantages for applications like least squares solvers, showing promise for practical use.

Abstract: Random sketching is a dimensionality reduction technique that approximately
preserves norms and singular values up to some $O(1)$ distortion factor with
high probability. The most popular sketches in literature are the Gaussian
sketch and the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform, while the CountSketch
has lower complexity. Combining two sketches, known as multisketching, offers
an inexpensive means of quickly reducing the dimension of a matrix by combining
a CountSketch and Gaussian sketch.
  However, there has been little investigation into high performance
CountSketch implementations. In this work, we develop an efficient GPU
implementation of the CountSketch, and demonstrate the performance of
multisketching using this technique. We also demonstrate the potential for
using this implementation within a multisketched least squares solver that is
up to $77\%$ faster than the normal equations with significantly better
numerical stability, at the cost of an $O(1)$ multiplicative factor introduced
into the relative residual norm.

*Amy Guan,Marissa Reitsma,Roshni Sahoo,Joshua Salomon,Stefan Wager*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to estimate population health indicators by combining low-resolution, unbiased data sources with high-resolution, potentially biased data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-resolution health indicators to enable precision public health efforts.

Method: The approach combines unbiased administrative data and biased individual-level survey responses using KL divergence and a defined model of sampling bias.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated better performance compared to single data source approaches during testing across multiple health indicators and geographic resolutions.

Conclusion: Combining multiple data sources using this data fusion method improves the accuracy of health indicator estimates and supports precision public health decision-making.

Abstract: High-resolution estimates of population health indicators are critical for
precision public health. We propose a method for high-resolution estimation
that fuses distinct data sources: an unbiased, low-resolution data source (e.g.
aggregated administrative data) and a potentially biased, high-resolution data
source (e.g. individual-level online survey responses). We assume that the
potentially biased, high-resolution data source is generated from the
population under a model of sampling bias where observables can have arbitrary
impact on the probability of response but the difference in the log
probabilities of response between units with the same observables is linear in
the difference between sufficient statistics of their observables and outcomes.
Our data fusion method learns a distribution that is closest (in the sense of
KL divergence) to the online survey distribution and consistent with the
aggregated administrative data and our model of sampling bias. This method
outperforms baselines that rely on either data source alone on a testbed that
includes repeated measurements of three indicators measured by both the
(online) Household Pulse Survey and ground-truth data sources at two geographic
resolutions over the same time period.

### [299] [Correct Black-Box Monitors for Distributed Deadlock Detection: Formalisation and Implementation (Technical Report)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14851)
*Radosław Jan Rowicki,Adrian Francalanza,Alceste Scalas*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting deadlocks in large-scale concurrent distributed (micro)services systems by designing distributed black-box monitors. These monitors solely rely on observing message exchanges and probing other monitors to diagnose problems without affecting service logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to handle increasing deadlock risks in growing and complex distributed systems, as deadlocks create cascading system blockages that complicate diagnosis and resolution.

Method: A distributed black-box monitoring algorithm is proposed. It uses formal modeling to capture RPC application styles and proves its algorithm to be sound and complete. The algorithm was implemented as DDMon and evaluated with Erlang/OTP applications.

Result: The researchers provided a formal sound and complete algorithm for deadlock detection in distributed systems, implemented it as DDMon, which was shown to work effectively through evaluations. The correctness of the approach was mechanized in Coq.

Conclusion: The paper presents the first formalized and implemented efficient distributed black-box monitoring tool for deadlock detection in microservices. It shows promise for diagnosing deadlocks accurately without impacting service functionalities.

Abstract: Many software applications rely on concurrent and distributed (micro)services
that interact via message-passing and various forms of remote procedure calls
(RPC). As these systems organically evolve and grow in scale and complexity,
the risk of introducing deadlocks increases and their impact may worsen: even
if only a few services deadlock, many other services may block while awaiting
responses from the deadlocked ones. As a result, the "core" of the deadlock can
be obfuscated by its consequences on the rest of the system, and diagnosing and
fixing the problem can be challenging.
  In this work we tackle the challenge by proposing distributed black-box
monitors that are deployed alongside each service and detect deadlocks by only
observing the incoming and outgoing messages, and exchanging probes with other
monitors. We present a formal model that captures popular RPC-based application
styles (e.g., gen_servers in Erlang/OTP), and a distributed black-box
monitoring algorithm that we prove sound and complete (i.e., identifies
deadlocked services with neither false positives nor false negatives). We
implement our results in a tool called DDMon for the monitoring of Erlang/OTP
applications, and we evaluate its performance.
  This is the first work that formalises, proves the correctness, and
implements distributed black-box monitors for deadlock detection. Our results
are mechanised in Coq. DDMon is the companion artifact of this paper.

*Daniel Hausmann,Shufang Zhu,Gianmarco Parretti,Christoph Weinhuber,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Nir Piterman*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper introduces solvers for reactive synthesis using the logics LTLfp and PPLTLp through the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy. It compares two types of game-based methods for constructing solvers and evaluates their practical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective solvers capable of handling temporal logics (LTLfp and PPLTLp) in reactive synthesis while achieving full LTL expressiveness.

Method: Two solvers were developed based on game-theoretic approaches: (1) a symbolic solver using Emerson-Lei games, which transforms property types into higher-level ones, and (2) Manna-Pnueli games, integrating Manna-Pnueli objectives directly into the game arena and solving through simpler sub-games.

Result: The solvers were implemented and evaluated on representative formulas, with results showing that Manna-Pnueli games often provide better performance, though not universally.

Conclusion: Manna-Pnueli games exhibit significant benefits in terms of efficiency but are not always superior. Combining both approaches could optimize practical applications further.

Abstract: Recently, the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy has been used to define the temporal
logics LTLfp and PPLTLp, which allow to use finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques
in infinite-trace settings while achieving the expressiveness of full LTL. In
this paper, we present the first actual solvers for reactive synthesis in these
logics. These are based on games on graphs that leverage DFA-based techniques
from LTLf/PPLTL to construct the game arena. We start with a symbolic solver
based on Emerson-Lei games, which reduces lower-class properties (guarantee,
safety) to higher ones (recurrence, persistence) before solving the game. We
then introduce Manna-Pnueli games, which natively embed Manna-Pnueli objectives
into the arena. These games are solved by composing solutions to a DAG of
simpler Emerson-Lei games, resulting in a provably more efficient approach. We
implemented the solvers and practically evaluated their performance on a range
of representative formulas. The results show that Manna-Pnueli games often
offer significant advantages, though not universally, indicating that combining
both approaches could further enhance practical performance.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces FinAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in multi-step reasoning-based information retrieval in the financial domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional information retrieval (IR) methods struggle with retrieval accuracy in the financial domain due to challenges such as semantic similarity, document structure reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The paper introduces a large-scale benchmark, FinAgentBench, with 3,429 expert-annotated examples that assess multi-step reasoning by LLMs in financial document retrieval. The evaluation is split into identifying the most relevant document type and pinpointing key passages.

Result: State-of-the-art models were evaluated using FinAgentBench, and it was shown that targeted fine-tuning significantly improves retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark lays a foundation for understanding and improving retrieval-centric behavior of LLMs in complex, domain-specific financial tasks. The dataset will be made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

*Jingmao Zhang,Zhiting Zhao,Yunqi Lin,Jianghong Ma,Tianjun Wei,Haijun Zhang,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes DP2Rec, a dual-phase recommendation model leveraging playtime and multimodal data to optimize both accuracy and diversity in game recommendations. Experiments show its superior performance on a real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the video game industry necessitates scalable recommendation systems that maintain user engagement, addressing underutilized playtime data and the potential of multimodal information for diverse recommendations.

Method: The paper introduces DP2Rec, comprising two key modules: (1) a playtime-guided interest exploration module using dual-beta modeling for fine-grained user profiling, and (2) a playtime-guided multimodal random walks module to enhance cross-category discovery through interest and semantic similarities.

Result: The proposed DP2Rec model outperforms existing methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and diversity in experiments conducted on a real-world game dataset.

Conclusion: DP2Rec effectively leverages playtime data and multimodal information to optimize game recommendation systems, achieving a superior balance of accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

*Moran Sorka,Alon Gorenshtein,Dvir Aran,Shahar Shelly*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the capability of ten large language models (LLMs) in specialized neurological reasoning using a benchmark of 305 questions and explores approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a novel multi-agent system. The multi-agent method delivered dramatic improvements in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess LLMs’ capability to handle highly specialized and complex neurological reasoning tasks, which is crucial for real-world medical applications.

Method: They benchmarked the performance of ten LLMs using questions categorized by complexity and experimented with RAG and a multi-agent system that divides reasoning into cognitive steps like analysis, synthesis, and validation.

Result: The multi-agent framework dramatically improved performance, particularly for mid-range models, e.g., increasing accuracy from 69.5% to 89.2% for a base model. Specialized cognitive processes led to better consistency across subspecialty question categories.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent approaches significantly enhance the ability of LLMs in complex medical reasoning tasks, presenting a promising avenue for AI-assisted clinical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering

*Lorenz Brehme,Benedikt Dornauer,Thomas Ströhle,Maximilian Ehrhart,Ruth Breu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores the real-world application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in industry by conducting interviews with practitioners. Findings show limited RAG applications in domain-specific tasks, with prototypes prioritized over ethics and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the practical application of RAG in industrial contexts, despite its growing industry adoption.

Method: A semistructured interview study was conducted with 13 industry practitioners to understand how RAG is applied in practice.

Result: RAG applications are mostly limited to domain-specific QA tasks in prototype stages. Key concerns for practitioners were data security, quality, and preprocessing challenges. Evaluation methods are human-driven, with less focus on automation.

Conclusion: RAG in industry has potential but faces challenges such as data management, evaluation techniques, and less attention to scalability and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly
conducted by humans rather than automated methods.

### [307] [MISS: Multi-Modal Tree Indexing and Searching with Lifelong Sequential Behavior for Retrieval Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14515)
*Chengcheng Guo,Junda She,Kuo Cai,Shiyao Wang,Qigen Hu,Qiang Luo,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISS, which integrates multi-modal information and lifelong sequence modeling within a retrieval model, aiming to enhance industrial recommendation systems through a novel index tree and advanced interest-searching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial recommendation systems face challenges in efficiently utilizing lifelong user behavior and multi-modal information in retrieval stages, which can improve recommendation accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes MISS, which consists of a multi-modal index tree to represent item similarity using multi-modal embeddings, and innovative search units (Co-GSU and MM-GSU) for user interest recognition in lifelong sequences.

Result: MISS enhances the retrieval model by integrating multi-modal and lifelong behavioral data, improving recommendation system efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: MISS demonstrates the ability to more effectively capture user interests through advanced multi-modal and lifelong sequence modeling, addressing limitations in standard retrieval models.

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

*Madiraju Srilakshmi,Kartavya Kothari,Kamlesh Marathe,Vedavyas Chigurupati,Hitesh Kapoor*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalized contest recommendation system for fantasy sports platforms using the Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of matching heterogeneous player preferences to the highly varied contests available on fantasy sports platforms.

Method: The study employs the Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) as the core of the contest recommendation system, designed to scale for millions of contests and players.

Result: The system was implemented in production on a major fantasy sports platform, showing significant improvements in recall and key business metrics through online experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed recommendation system effectively enhances personalization and has a measurable impact on user experience and platform performance.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete
against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points
based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our
company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily
contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked
improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical
business metrics.

### [309] [RewardRank: Optimizing True Learning-to-Rank Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14180)
*Gaurav Bhatt,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil,Tanmay Gangwani,Tesi Xiao,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RewardRank, a framework for optimized ranking using counterfactual reward learning, outperforming traditional methods relying on simplistic assumptions about user behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ranking models misalign with real-world user behavior due to simplistic assumptions, failing to account for complex factors like position bias or brand affinity.

Method: RewardRank estimates user engagement with deep utility models using logged data, optimizing rankings via soft permutation operators in an end-to-end manner. It also establishes evaluation protocols via oracle-based and LLM-simulated user behavior.

Result: Experiments using datasets like Baidu-ULTR and Amazon KDD Cup demonstrate that RewardRank performs better than strong baselines in optimizing rankings for user utility.

Conclusion: RewardRank provides a more accurate and effective way to model and optimize rankings by capturing complex user behavior, improving overall engagement metrics.

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

### [310] [OneLoc: Geo-Aware Generative Recommender Systems for Local Life Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14646)
*Zhipeng Wei,Kuo Cai,Junda She,Jie Chen,Minghao Chen,Yang Zeng,Qiang Luo,Wencong Zeng,Ruiming Tang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces OneLoc, an end-to-end generative recommendation model for local life services in Kuaishou App, addressing geographic information and multi-objective balancing to improve recommendation outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address challenges in local life service recommendation: incorporating real-time geographic information and balancing multiple objectives (user interest, proximity, and business goals).

Method: OneLoc leverages geographic information through geo-aware semantic ID, geo-aware self-attention, and neighbor-aware prompt techniques in tokenization, encoding, and generation respectively. It employs reinforcement learning with geographic and GMV rewards to balance objectives.

Result: OneLoc has demonstrated significant improvements in metrics, boosting gross merchandise value (GMV) by 21.016% and order numbers by 17.891% in the Kuaishou App.

Conclusion: OneLoc effectively addresses the challenges of location-based video recommendation in local life services, showing scalable performance and successful deployment for 400 million active users.

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

### [311] [New Insights into Automatic Treatment Planning for Cancer Radiotherapy Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14229)
*Md Mainul Abrar,Xun Jia,Yujie Chi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how an AI using an ACER network makes decisions for prostate cancer treatment planning, revealing its learning process and decision strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the decision-making process of AI in treatment planning transparent and trustworthy.

Method: Using the ACER network applied to prostate cancer radiotherapy, researchers performed explainable AI techniques to analyze how the AI interprets inputs and makes decisions. Agents were evaluated by multiple metrics like their tuning actions and policy spaces.

Result: The AI learned to identify dose violations and apply actions effectively, leading to high-quality treatment planning with less tuning effort. Key metrics like entropy and tuning steps distinguished high-performing agents.

Conclusion: High-performing agents mimic skilled human planners by applying a global tuning strategy. Enhanced interpretability fosters clinician trust and improves automation strategies.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of
an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the
Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes
treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer
intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents
from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method
to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to
TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and
efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining
these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated
high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned
to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate
TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH
attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across
tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required
fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning
space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few
TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning
steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER
agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a
global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like
skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process
may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment
planning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PET-DPC, a conditional diffusion model for fast and accurate positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction, addressing key challenges in data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for PET reconstruction are hindered by quantitative inaccuracies, artifacts, limited model interpretability, and risks of overfitting, preventing their clinical adoption.

Method: The proposed PET-DPC combines a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical corrections. It features a normalization procedure to create an initial probabilistic image and incorporates scatter, attenuation, and other corrections during diffusion sampling.

Result: PET-DPC showed enhanced accuracy over traditional and deep learning methods, reducing reconstruction times by 50%-85%, performing well on out-of-distribution data, and preserving imaging quality in validation experiments.

Conclusion: PET-DPC offers a rapid and accurate solution for PET reconstruction, demonstrating strong potential to enhance clinical imaging workflows and overcome limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data
has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve
fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the
presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven
dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical
adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with
posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An
innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF
Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated
during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior
scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated
on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated
brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully
corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in
quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative
methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data.
Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for
brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the
critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation
corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical
phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background
uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios.
Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid,
quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve
clinical imaging workflows.

*Shayan Bafandkar,Sungyong Chung,Homa Khosravian,Alireza Talebpour*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAPPL, an AI-powered tutoring system for personalized engineering education using GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional engineering education methods lack personalization and fail to meet individual student needs.

Method: Developed PAPPL, combining AI, ITS modules (expert, student, tutor, interface), and GPT-4o for dynamic feedback based on student interactions.

Result: PAPPL detects misconceptions, adapts feedback progressively, and provides analytics for instructors.

Conclusion: PAPPL demonstrates scalable Generative AI's potential in personalized learning, transforming engineering education.

Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,
standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and
interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and
personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering
education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in
adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and
homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,
impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)
platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically
for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,
data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to
enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly
in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert
module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,
a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and
pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely
records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates
progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts
dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers
instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to
teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the
progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering
important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider
possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.

*Lameck Mbangula Amugongo,Nicola J Bidwell,Joseph Mwatukange*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study explores how 157 African professionals and students conceptualize trust in AI, highlighting the influence of cultural and societal contexts on their views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding trust in AI from the perspectives of African professionals and users, particularly given the dominance of Western-centric studies.

Method: The study surveyed 157 participants from 25 African countries, focusing on their professional and educational connections to AI, as well as their personal backgrounds and experiences.

Result: Respondents highlighted the role of community values, with factors like educational background and transnational mobility shaping their trust and distrust in AI applications. Afro-relationalism nuances were applied to international trust constructs.

Conclusion: The research underscores the need for more empirical studies on how trust in AI is understood and practically applied in African contexts, emphasizing culturally informed perspectives in AI governance.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and
application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across
industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who
develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal
experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the
constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,
reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of
existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,
Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about
trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or
use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional
and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how
they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops
about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational
background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their
concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust
in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed
to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by
the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over
individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying
nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as
reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical
research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African
social realities of AI design, use and governance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Fabric,' a public repository documenting AI use cases and governance mechanisms to understand human oversight and AI governance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in documented governance mechanisms for deployed AI and to study how oversight of AI systems is executed in practice.

Method: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with practitioners to gather 20 AI use cases, co-designed AI workflow diagrams, and created a repository styled as "Fabric" to illustrate governance mechanisms.

Result: The Fabric repository provides detailed visualizations and descriptions of AI systems in practice, identifies governance gaps, and surfaces patterns in human oversight.

Conclusion: The Fabric repository is designed as a resource for researchers, aiming to enable a deeper understanding of AI governance and to evolve as governance mechanisms advance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from
financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic
literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms
that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available
repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms.
Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial
set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow
with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used
in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams
of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository,
we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of
deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving
tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

### [316] [Incident Analysis for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14231)

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for analyzing incidents caused by AI agents, focusing on understanding their causes to prevent future occurrences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rising deployment of AI agents, incidents causing harm are increasing. Current incident reporting processes lack the depth to analyze these issues, especially given the availability of sensitive and critical data.

Method: The authors propose an incident analysis framework based on system safety principles. It identifies three main factors for incidents: system-related, contextual, and cognitive, alongside critical information like activity logs and system documentation.

Result: The paper provides clear recommendations for enhancing incident reports and advises developers to retain information essential for post-incident analysis.

Conclusion: To manage risks effectively in an AI agent-dominant future, understanding the causes of their incidents is vital. Comprehensive frameworks and reporting processes are crucial for this purpose.

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing
number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly
cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private
information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such
incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent
future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not
sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are
largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but
potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or
browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting
processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on
systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that
can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual
(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user
request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which
factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation
and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide
recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)
what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to
incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more
agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for
managing risks.

### [319] [Systematic FAIRness Assessment of Open Voice Biomarker Datasets for Mental Health and Neurodegenerative Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14089)
*Ishaan Mahapatra,Nihar R. Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper assesses the FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) of voice biomarker datasets, uncovering weaknesses and offering recommendations to improve their usability for mental health and neurodegenerative disease applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in the clinical adoption of voice biomarkers due to inconsistent quality and limited usability of available datasets.

Method: The authors conducted a FAIR evaluation of 27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets using the FAIR Data Maturity Model combined with a structured, priority-weighted scoring method.

Result: The analysis showed consistently high Findability but notable weaknesses and variability in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability, especially for mental health datasets. Repository choice significantly impacted the FAIR scores.

Conclusion: To enhance the utility of voice biomarker datasets, the paper recommends adopting structured, domain-specific standards, using FAIR-compliant repositories, and applying FAIR evaluation frameworks systematically.

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing,
and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and
monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical
adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of
publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first
systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of
27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas.
Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring
method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels.
Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability
and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental
health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while
neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice
also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and
clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata
standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying
structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable
guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating
the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

*Euiyeon Kim,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a music source separation model using Mamba2 (a state space model) and a dual-path architecture for vocal isolation, achieving new state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenge of accurately isolating vocals in music, which is problematic for Transformer-based models in handling intermittently occurring vocals.

Method: A Mamba2 state space model is used for capturing long-range temporal dependencies, combined with a dual-path architecture and a band-splitting strategy to handle long input sequences efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the model achieves a new state-of-the-art cSDR of 11.03 dB, with substantial gains in uSDR, and consistent performance across varied input conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed Mamba-based model is highly effective for high-resolution audio processing and opens up new possibilities for broader audio research applications.

Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal
isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture
intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state
space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long
input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a
dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to
date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits
stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal
occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based
models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for
broader applications in audio research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a foundation model for machine signal modeling, overcoming limitations of fixed input lengths and lacking positional encoding, with state-of-the-art results on a large-scale benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing approaches in machine signal modeling, particularly fixed input lengths and absence of frequency positional encoding.

Method: The authors propose a foundation model with advanced band-split architecture and relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling arbitrary input lengths and precise spectral localization.

Result: Their model achieves state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and fault identification on the SIREN benchmark, which integrates multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates superior effectiveness and generalization, supporting arbitrary input lengths without segmentation or padding, and the code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision
and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering
acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored.
Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive
results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit
frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation
model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative
frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across
arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary
length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that
retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN
(https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark
for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE
task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in
anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and
generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on

### [322] [Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14232)
*Matthew Andres Moreno,Sanaz Hasanzadeh Fard,Luis Zaman,Emily Dolson*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: Multilevel selection often conflicts individual and group-level fitness. This paper uses agent-based modeling to assess methods for detecting such selection in artificial life systems, revealing sensitivity to significant effects but challenges with smaller ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multilevel selection dynamics has implications for evolutionary traits, major transitions, and pathogen virulence, especially in artificial life research.

Method: Agent-based modeling was used to simulate multilevel selection in an epidemiological framework. A normalization procedure was developed to identify clade-level fitness effects, and various environmental conditions were tested for robustness.

Result: The approach successfully detected multilevel selection with a 30% impact on fitness but struggled with smaller effects (10%). Robustness tests showed consistent performance under environmental variability.

Conclusion: This research advances methods to quantify multilevel selection effects, showing promise for broader applications despite sensitivity limitations to smaller effects.

Abstract: Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive
interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and
quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging
from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is
particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to
major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti
Franceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by
screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by
chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated
with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived
descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth
to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under
challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by
Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model
multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and
between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we
develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level
fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites
under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see
sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of
this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic,
time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population
compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent
with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards
rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.

Motivation: To address errors and delays in manual diagnosis of wrist/hand fractures and to explore transformer-based models' potential in medical imaging.

Method: Fine-tuned RT-DETR and Co-DETR on 26,000 labeled X-rays, applied supervised contrastive learning, and used ResNet-50 for refining classification.

Result: Co-DETR achieved an AP@50 of 0.615 and the pipeline showed 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on real-world X-rays.

Conclusion: The Co-DETR-based approach offers accurate, efficient, and scalable fracture detection, fitting well into hospital workflows for better diagnostics.

Abstract: Background: Accurate diagnosis of wrist and hand fractures using radiographs
is essential in emergency care, but manual interpretation is slow and prone to
errors. Transformer-based models show promise in improving medical image
analysis, but their application to extremity fractures is limited. This study
addresses this gap by applying object detection transformers to wrist and hand
X-rays.
  Methods: We fine-tuned the RT-DETR and Co-DETR models, pre-trained on COCO,
using over 26,000 annotated X-rays from a proprietary clinical dataset. Each
image was labeled for fracture presence with bounding boxes. A ResNet-50
classifier was trained on cropped regions to refine abnormality classification.
Supervised contrastive learning was used to enhance embedding quality.
Performance was evaluated using AP@50, precision, and recall metrics, with
additional testing on real-world X-rays.
  Results: RT-DETR showed moderate results (AP@50 = 0.39), while Co-DETR
outperformed it with an AP@50 of 0.615 and faster convergence. The integrated
pipeline achieved 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on
real-world X-rays, demonstrating strong generalization across 13 fracture
types. Visual inspection confirmed accurate localization.
  Conclusion: Our Co-DETR-based pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and
clinical relevance in wrist and hand fracture detection, offering reliable
localization and differentiation of fracture types. It is scalable, efficient,
and suitable for real-time deployment in hospital workflows, improving
diagnostic speed and reliability in musculoskeletal radiology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model (nnU-Net) for segmenting hepatic anatomy from MRI, achieving high accuracy for various structures to aid preoperative planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to develop an automated deep learning-based segmentation method to ease the clinical workflow for preoperative planning in liver surgeries by accurately segmenting liver anatomy.

Method: A nnU-Net was trained on MRI scans from 72 patients, focusing on preserving structure topology. Performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients on an 18-patient test set and an additional clinical assessment dataset.

Result: The segmentation model achieved DSCs ranging from 0.97 for parenchyma to 0.74 for portal vein in the test set. Clinically, only minor adjustments were needed for parenchyma and veins, while tumor segmentation showed more variability.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient and accurate way to segment hepatic anatomy, enabling its use as a standard-of-care tool for 3D surgical planning, and even identified tumors missed by radiologists.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep
learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e.,
parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the
hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the
clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans
from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020
and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72
patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.
Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and
manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following
clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated
using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required
adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,
0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for
tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was
76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment
dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D
models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)
and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater
variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model
detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate
and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be
applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver
surgery.

*Justin Yiu,Kushank Arora,Daniel Steinberg,Rohit Ghiya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning and xAI techniques for automated knee MRI analysis, finding that CNNs often outperform other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of MRI is time-consuming and relies on observer skill, motivating the need for automation with robust interpretability.

Method: The study investigated supervised and self-supervised deep learning models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, ViT, U-Net variants) paired with xAI methods like Grad-CAM. Model assessment used metrics such as AUC, PSNR/SSIM, and qualitative visuals.

Result: ResNet50 showed the best performance for classification and ROI tasks. Grad-CAM provided the most meaningful clinical explanations. Transformer models underperformed compared to CNNs for this dataset.

Conclusion: CNN-based transfer learning is most effective for this dataset. Larger-scale pretraining may enhance transformer-based models.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for
assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains
time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a
systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with
explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI)
detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised
approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and
multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate
xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed
using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along
with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50
consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming
transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While
hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in
reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains
lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful
explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges
as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with
larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a practical definition of 'hallucinations' in medical devices as plausible errors and discusses methodologies for evaluating and mitigating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the frequent occurrence of errors termed as 'hallucinations' in deep learning-based medical devices and to establish a universal framework for their evaluation.

Method: A theoretical and empirical approach is utilized to define 'hallucinations,' augmented by examples from imaging and non-imaging applications, linking the definition to evaluation and mitigation strategies.

Result: A universal definition of hallucinations in medical devices is proposed, and its application to evaluation methodologies and error reduction strategies is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The proposed definition helps standardize how hallucinations in medical devices are assessed, fostering improved error mitigation techniques and evaluation processes across various applications.

Abstract: Computer methods in medical devices are frequently imperfect and are known to
produce errors in clinical or diagnostic tasks. However, when deep learning and
data-based approaches yield output that exhibit errors, the devices are
frequently said to hallucinate. Drawing from theoretical developments and
empirical studies in multiple medical device areas, we introduce a practical
and universal definition that denotes hallucinations as a type of error that is
plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The
definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer
from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and
non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to
evaluation methodologies and discuss existing approaches for minimizing the
prevalence of hallucinations.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents MeshLDM, a Latent Diffusion Model for generating realistic 3D cardiac anatomy meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic and diverse 3D cardiac anatomy is crucial for applications like medical simulations, in silico trials, and machine learning augmentation in cardiology.

Method: Introduces a novel Latent Diffusion Model (MeshLDM), tested on 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Result: MeshLDM accurately captures cardiac shapes at different phases with only a 2.4% difference in the population mean compared to the gold standard.

Conclusion: MeshLDM demonstrates strong potential for synthesizing realistic 3D cardiac anatomies, with applications in cardiology and related fields.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative
capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized
data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still
scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac
anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials,
electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine
learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To
this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed
model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from
patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms
of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction
metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the
cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction)
cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean
compared to the gold standard.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FGRestore, a fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, and proposes FGResQ, a new IQA model that outperforms state-of-the-art metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in image restoration, existing image quality assessment (IQA) metrics fail to accurately differentiate fine-grained quality differences among restored images.

Method: The authors developed FGRestore, a dataset with over 18,400 restored images and more than 30,000 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Using FGRestore, they benchmarked existing IQA metrics and identified their inconsistencies. They then proposed FGResQ, an IQA model integrating coarse-grained score regression with fine-grained quality ranking.

Result: FGResQ outperformed existing IQA metrics in both experiments and comparisons, demonstrating improved accuracy in image restoration quality assessment.

Conclusion: FGRestore fills a significant gap in IQA for image restoration, and FGResQ advances the field by providing more accurate assessments of fine-grained quality differences. Both resources contribute substantially to performance evaluation and algorithm optimization in this domain.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image
restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality
assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and
algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit
inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained
quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we
contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset
for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images
across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores,
FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences.
Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA
metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA
evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these
findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for
image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and
fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate
that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and
model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in skin lesion segmentation like complex lesion structures, unclear boundaries, and scale variations.

Method: The approach improves TransUNet by incorporating a transformer module for semantic modeling, convolutional branches for texture preservation, a boundary-guided attention mechanism, and multi-scale upsampling.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates the model's superior performance in metrics like mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, particularly in boundary localization and structural recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers enhanced robustness and reliability for automated skin lesion segmentation, addressing key challenges effectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an
improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion
structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion
images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional
encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining
a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This
enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A
boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also
designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency.
To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were
conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis,
data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split
ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms
existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating
stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model
achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex
scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation
tasks in skin lesion analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method for reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal ultrasound sweeps without needing external tracking or pose estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of 3D ultrasound adoption, including dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition protocols, and to enable scalable diagnostic solutions.

Method: Introduces Gaussian Splatting principles to ultrasound imaging, utilizing a slice-aware differentiable rasterizer. Optimizes a 3D Gaussian-based representation using image-level supervision, sensorless motion estimation, and geometric priors.

Result: Achieved accurate and memory-efficient 3D reconstructions with high spatial fidelity from 2D ultrasound images.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates 3D ultrasound imaging is achievable computationally, offering scalable, hardware-independent diagnostic solutions and enabling AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic
accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains
limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition
protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for
reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal
ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose
estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the
domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer
tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model
anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their
parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe
motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a
compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures
anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that
accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through
purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D
systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for virtual multiplex staining using latent diffusion models (LDMs) to generate multiplex images from H&E images, overcoming challenges in data acquisition cost and availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiplex imaging offers richer molecular-level insights than H&E staining but is hindered by costs and data availability. Bridging the gap between imaging modalities can unlock potential for large-scale retrospective studies.

Method: The authors utilize pretrained latent diffusion models to conditionally generate multiplex images marker-by-marker. They fine-tuned the model for single-step sampling, improving pixel-level fidelity and inference speed.

Result: Validation on two public datasets demonstrated the generation of up to 18 different marker types with higher accuracy compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: This framework pioneers virtual multiplex staining, bridging H&E and multiplex imaging, and unlocking possibilities for retrospective and large-scale studies with existing data repositories.

Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous
visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing
molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition
have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large
repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting
opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage
recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling
complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a
target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual
multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate
multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our
approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion
model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.
To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different
marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for
single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference
efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two
publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in
generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a
substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.
This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual
multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and
multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale
analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

Conclusion: This work bridges medical image analysis with biomechanical simulations, enhancing the digital twin ecosystem for personalized healthcare applications, particularly in large-scale and underrepresented population studies.

Abstract: Digital twins offer a powerful framework for subject-specific simulation and
clinical decision support, yet their development often hinges on accurate,
individualized anatomical modeling. In this work, we present a rule-based
approach for subpixel-accurate key-point extraction from MRI, adapted from
prior CT-based methods. Our approach incorporates robust image alignment and
vertebra-specific orientation estimation to generate anatomically meaningful
landmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points, like
muscle and ligament insertions in biomechanical models. These models enable the
simulation of spinal mechanics considering the subject's individual anatomy,
and thus support the development of tailored approaches in clinical diagnostics
and treatment planning. By leveraging MR imaging, our method is radiation-free
and well-suited for large-scale studies and use in underrepresented
populations. This work contributes to the digital twin ecosystem by bridging
the gap between precise medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation,
and aligns with key themes in personalized modeling for healthcare.

### [333] [Distributional Adversarial Attacks and Training in Deep Hedging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14757)
*Guangyi He,Tobias Sutter,Lukas Gonon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the robustness of classical deep hedging models under distributional shifts and introduces an adversarial training framework to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical deep hedging strategies are susceptible to performance degradation under small input perturbations, highlighting the need for more robust methodologies.

Method: The authors adapt adversarial attacks to the distributional setting by using a Wasserstein ball-based reformulation for adversarial optimization, enabling computational efficiency in training resilient deep hedging strategies.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that deep hedging strategies trained adversarially perform better in out-of-sample scenarios and are more resilient to model misspecifications compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial training framework provides a robust and practical approach to address real market uncertainties in deep hedging strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies
under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks.
We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to
small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant
performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training
framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our
approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting
and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial
optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient
training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional
perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that
adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their
classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to
model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective
framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.

### [335] [Lagrangian Simulation Volume-Based Contour Tree Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14339)
*Domantas Dilys,Hamish Carr,Steven Boeing*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for efficient contour tree simplification directly on parcel-in-cell simulation data without resampling, leveraging Delaunay tetrahedralization and hypersweep implementation in Viskores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies and inaccuracies in using resampled grid data for contour tree computation and simplification in parcel-based convective cloud simulations.

Method: The authors use Delaunay tetrahedralization of parcel centroids combined with hypersweep-style implementation in Viskores, avoiding reliance on uniform grids and enabling volume calculations directly on irregular data.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly faster while providing better quality segmentation by avoiding interpolation artifacts compared to traditional grid-based approaches.

Conclusion: The approach improves computational efficiency and data fidelity in contour tree computation for irregular parcel-in-cell simulations.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering problems are modelled by simulating scalar
fields defined either on space-filling meshes (Eulerian) or as particles
(Lagrangian). For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as
contour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out
small-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,
simplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than
persistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting
regular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data
onto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a
high sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for
processing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to
parcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using
Delaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of
relying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done
for cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.
10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement
this in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for
parallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any
integrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed
directly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a
resampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,
avoiding interpolation artifacts.

TL;DR: The paper studies the Hilbert geometry of an extended Gaussian family and provides closed-form formulas for its metric, exploring properties and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the geometry and metric properties of the extended Gaussian family for broader mathematical and practical understanding.

Method: The research investigates the symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone's Hilbert geometry, deriving closed-form formulas for its metric distance and analyzing invariance properties.

Result: The study offers a closed-form formula for Hilbert metric distance in the bicone, alongside a thorough investigation of its invariance features.

Conclusion: The findings advance knowledge about the geometry of extended Gaussian distributions, with potential implications for their application in statistical and practical domains.

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained
by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by
degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both
degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a
symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric
positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we
study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric
positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the
corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance
properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for
dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

*Jordan Peper,Yan Miao,Sayan Mitra,Ivan Ruchkin*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flexible methodology for verifying vision-based autonomy systems under out-of-distribution conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread use of deep learning in autonomous systems, verifying their safety is challenging due to their black-box nature and sensitivity to distribution shifts.

Method: The paper proposes an abstraction-based verification methodology that uses interval Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to link perception models with offline validation, offering adaptive guarantees to match out-of-distribution test-time scenarios.

Result: The approach was evaluated on synthetic perception models and the mountain car benchmark, demonstrating its ability to establish rigorous and tight safety bounds under varying conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel and flexible verification framework, overcoming the rigidity of traditional approaches, to enhance reliable situational awareness in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Precise and comprehensive situational awareness is a critical capability of
modern autonomous systems. Deep neural networks that perceive task-critical
details from rich sensory signals have become ubiquitous; however, their
black-box behavior and sensitivity to environmental uncertainty and
distribution shifts make them challenging to verify formally. Abstraction-based
verification techniques for vision-based autonomy produce safety guarantees
contingent on rigid assumptions, such as bounded errors or known unique
distributions. Such overly restrictive and inflexible assumptions limit the
validity of the guarantees, especially in diverse and uncertain test-time
environments. We propose a methodology that unifies the verification models of
perception with their offline validation. Our methodology leverages interval
MDPs and provides a flexible end-to-end guarantee that adapts directly to the
out-of-distribution test-time conditions. We evaluate our methodology on a
synthetic perception Markov chain with well-defined state estimation
distributions and a mountain car benchmark. Our findings reveal that we can
guarantee tight yet rigorous bounds on overall system safety.

existing algorithms in addressing multi-agent reinforcement learning problems.
Then, based on the existing algorithm MADDPG, we introduce a new parameter to
increase the reward that an agent can obtain when cooperative behavior among

environments from PettingZoo. The results show that the new algorithm helps
agents achieve both higher team rewards and individual rewards.

TL;DR: OmniSense is an edge-assisted framework aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of 360° video analytics for extended reality applications by optimizing resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of 360° cameras and extended reality applications has created a need for advanced video analytics capable of extracting actionable insights with minimal latency and resource expenditure.

Method: OmniSense introduces a spherical region of interest (SRoI) prediction algorithm to filter out redundant data. It dynamically scales vision models based on video content and network conditions for efficient analysis.

Result: Evaluations on real-world 360° video datasets show OmniSense improves accuracy by 19.8%–114.6% compared to resource-agnostic baselines while maintaining similar latency. It also achieves 2.0×–2.4× speedups while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: OmniSense successfully addresses computational and network resource challenges, making it a leading framework for immersive video analytics in handling 360° video data.

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we
present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video
analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the
significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end
latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping
the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

Conclusion: Surya represents a significant step forward in heliophysics, leveraging time advancement tasks on full-resolution Solar Dynamics Observatory data to learn generalized solar representations and potentially uncover underlying solar physics.

Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events
and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and
constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize
across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model
for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from
multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and
long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image
forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning.
Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and
flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active
region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the
first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext
task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper proves the conjecture by Nelson and Nguyen on optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, introducing a random matrix method that achieves high precision and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conjecture on optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, and to improve computational efficiency in matrix-based linear regression tasks.

Method: The authors propose a random matrix construction with parameters optimized for dimension and sparsity, combined with an innovative matrix concentration technique termed 'iterative decoupling.'

Result: The paper proves that a random matrix with specific sparsity and dimensions achieves precision and sparsity bounds for oblivious subspace embeddings, and offers the fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction for certain regression tasks.

Conclusion: The paper addresses and confirms the conjecture by Nelson and Nguyen, introducing new tools and techniques for improving efficiency in linear regression applications with theoretical guarantees on precision and sparsity.

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the
optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to
sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$,
there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde
O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability,
$(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic
factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current
matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a
broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call
iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment
bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya
and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

*Phurinut Srisawad,Juergen Branke,Long Tran-Thanh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This study explores how a leader can manipulate the follower's deterministic best response in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games by inferring their unknown linear utility function through interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of manipulating follower preferences in multi-objective games without prior knowledge of their utility function, balancing utility maximization with preference elicitation.

Method: The authors formalize the problem and propose two manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), designed to optimize leader actions and incentive offerings.

Result: The study demonstrates, both theoretically and empirically, that the longEU policy converges to optimal manipulation under infinite interactions, enhancing leader utility while fostering mutually beneficial outcomes.

Conclusion: This approach allows leaders to effectively manipulate followers in Stackelberg games, achieving improved cumulative utility for themselves and favorable outcomes for followers without explicit negotiation.

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces TraceQ, a trace-based method for reconstructing quantum circuit dataflow by observing patch activity during lattice surgery operations in fault-tolerant quantum computing. TraceQ demonstrates high accuracy in recovering quantum program structures from access traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in understanding and analyzing logical qubit interactions during lattice surgery operations in fault-tolerant quantum computing setups, particularly using surface codes.

Method: The authors define access traces to capture space-time activity patterns during lattice surgery and introduce the TraceQ framework. This framework uses heuristics and subgraph matching algorithms to reconstruct quantum circuits and analyze program execution.

Result: TraceQ can accurately recover subroutines or entire quantum programs using minimal access traces. It enables profiling, offline reconstruction, and precise identification of circuit structures in fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks.

Conclusion: Access traces, coupled with TraceQ, offer powerful tools for analyzing quantum program execution. They also pose potential risks as side channels, allowing reconstruction of circuit structures with high accuracy even offline.

Abstract: Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices
that employ error correction. A promising quantum error-correcting code for
large-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code,
Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery,
i.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice
surgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined
in this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces
reveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this
formulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction
framework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by
observing the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by
heuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its
effectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The
access traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling
analysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they
run on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such
traces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the
circuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even
whole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be
used to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high
accuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the
processing can be done fully offline. Along with the custom heuristics,
advanced subgraph matching algorithms used in this work enable a high rate of
locating the subroutines while executing in minimal time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust CNN-based method for segmenting live unstained cells imaged under challenging bright-field microscopy conditions, achieving high accuracy and generalizability across imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The segmentation of live cells using bright-field microscopy faces challenges such as low contrast, noise, and motion blur, which are not consistently addressed by existing methods. High throughput imaging adds to the complexity.

Method: A U-Net-based CNN pipeline was developed incorporating attention mechanisms, adaptive loss functions, ensemble techniques, hard instance retraining, and dynamic learning rates, among other innovations. The model was trained using a dataset mainly consisting of bright-field images.

Result: The proposed model achieved 93% test accuracy and an F1-score of 89% on noisy, low-contrast, and blurry images from a public dataset. It also generalized well to phase-contrast live cell imaging, which it was minimally trained on.

Conclusion: This method is low-cost, robust, adaptable, and deployable in real-world labs utilizing basic deep learning setups. It outperforms prior approaches for segmenting bright-field microscopy images, with strong potential for diverse biomedical applications.

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell
properties and dynamics in vitro. This study focuses on segmenting unstained
live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation
approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the
challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where
temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from
cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based
pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified
U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,
adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,
progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The
model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,
showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%
test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,
noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on
bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),
yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,
demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its
potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The
model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning
setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell
variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision
for bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available

### [347] [TIME$[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ via Tree Height Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831)
*Logan Nye*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper presents a proof demonstrating that deterministic multitape Turing machines with time complexity t can be simulated in a space complexity proportional to the square root of t. This is achieved using a novel Height Compression Theorem along with efficient methods for reshaping computational trees and managing memory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a tighter relationship between time and space complexity, specifically exploring whether multitape Turing machines can achieve significant space reductions without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Method: The authors prove a Height Compression Theorem and develop computational techniques like balanced recursion, potential bounding per DFS path, and binary combiners to reduce space usage. They also use an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-size tokens to ensure efficiency.

Result: The result is a deterministic simulation of TIME[t] in SPACE[O(√t)] for multitape Turing machines. By choosing optimal block sizes, they prove an additive tradeoff for space, achieving the desired square-root space usage.

Conclusion: The findings provide new upper bounds for branching programs, reinforce quadratic-time space lower bounds, and extend to higher-dimensional models under specific assumptions. The work has implications for theoretical computer science and complexity theory.

Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing
machines, showing ${\rm TIME}[[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key
step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes
the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run
into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log
T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$
at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness
across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique
interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential
that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an
indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners.
Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a
constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming,
ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding
the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with
$b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$
gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks
where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction
is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences
include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$
bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for
SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and
$O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality
assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.

### [348] [A Real-world Display Inverse Rendering Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14411)
*Seokjun Choi,Hoon-Gyu Chung,Yujin Jeon,Giljoo Nam,Seung-Hwan Baek*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for display-based inverse rendering using an LCD display and polarization cameras, enabling advanced evaluations and outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no publicly available real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering, despite the unique benefits of display-camera systems.

Method: The authors built an imaging system using an LCD display and stereo polarization cameras, capturing diverse objects under one-light-at-a-time patterns, along with high-quality ground-truth geometry.

Result: The dataset facilitates image synthesis under varied conditions, enables evaluations of existing inverse rendering methods, and demonstrates strong performance with a proposed baseline.

Conclusion: This work fills a gap in resources for display-based inverse rendering, setting a foundation for future research and evaluation in this domain, with code and dataset openly shared.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MeshCoder reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python scripts using a new multimodal large language model (LLM) and an expressive set of Blender Python APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with limited domain-specific languages and small datasets, hindering their ability to handle complex geometries and enable intuitive editing.

Method: MeshCoder introduces new Blender Python APIs and constructs a large paired object-code dataset. It trains a multimodal LLM to translate 3D point clouds into executable Blender Python scripts.

Result: MeshCoder achieves superior performance in converting shapes to code, enables intuitive editing through code changes, and improves a language model's reasoning in 3D shape tasks.

Conclusion: MeshCoder is a flexible, high-performing solution for reconstructing 3D shapes programmatically and improving 3D understanding via a code-based approach.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

### [350] [Snap-Snap: Taking Two Images to Reconstruct 3D Human Gaussians in Milliseconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14892)
*Jia Lu,Taoran Yi,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Chuiyun Wu,Wei Shen,Wenyu Liu,Qi Tian,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human bodies from just two images (front and back view), employing redesigned geometry models and enhancement algorithms for color data recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to lower barriers for creating 3D digital humans by enabling reconstruction from minimal input data, which can expand accessibility and application scope.

Method: Using redesigned geometry reconstruction models and an enhancement algorithm to predict point clouds and recover missing color data, followed by conversion into 3D Gaussians for improved rendering.

Result: The method achieves high-speed and high-quality reconstruction (190ms on an RTX 4090) with state-of-the-art performance, even on low-cost mobile-captured images.

Conclusion: This approach broadens the accessibility of 3D human reconstruction while maintaining precision and speed, suitable for diverse datasets and low-cost devices.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

### [351] [Non-Dissipative Graph Propagation for Non-Local Community Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14097)
*William Leeney,Alessio Gravina,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces uAGNN, an unsupervised graph neural network designed for community detection in heterophilic graphs using long-range information propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Community detection in heterophilic graphs is challenging due to distant connectivity among nodes from the same community.

Method: The proposed uAGNN uses antisymmetric weight matrices and non-dissipative dynamical systems to propagate long-range information efficiently during message passing.

Result: Experiments across ten datasets show uAGNN's superior performance in medium to high heterophilic graph settings compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: uAGNN is a promising tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph types, particularly those with heterophilic characteristics.

Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a
task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing
similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly
connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph
neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme
to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities.
In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information
during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in
heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric
Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach
leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to
propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight
matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the
limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten
datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium
heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range
dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for
unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.
