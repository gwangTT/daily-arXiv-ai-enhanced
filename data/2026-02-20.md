### [1] [AIdentifyAGE Ontology for Decision Support in Forensic Dental Age Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16714)
*Renato Marcelo,Ana Rodrigues,Cristiana Palmela Pereira,António Figueiras,Rui Santos,José Rui Figueira,Alexandre P Francisco,Cátia Vaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIdentifyAGE ontology to standardize and improve forensic and judicial dental age assessment, overcoming current challenges like methodological inconsistency and limited interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in forensic and judicial age assessments, such as methodological heterogeneity, lack of standardization, and transparency issues exacerbated by increasing AI adoption.

Method: This paper proposes the AIdentifyAGE ontology, a domain-specific framework that integrates manual and AI-assisted workflows for forensic dental age assessment, built with domain experts and adhering to FAIR principles.

Result: The ontology facilitates standardized workflows, interoperability, and traceability for forensic dental age assessment, benefiting judiciary and medico-legal systems.

Conclusion: AIdentifyAGE enhances transparency and reproducibility, paving the way for ontology-based decision support systems in judicial and medico-legal contexts.

Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.

### [2] [Retrieval Augmented (Knowledge Graph), and Large Language Model-Driven Design Structure Matrix (DSM) Generation of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16715)
*H. Sinan Bank,Daniel R. Herber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the potential of LLMs, RAG, and GraphRAG in generating Design Structure Matrices (DSMs), focusing on two test cases and tasks, while addressing performance and automated solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to automate the generation of Design Structure Matrices (DSMs) using advanced computational methods to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in systems architecture design.

Method: The paper employs Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Graph-based RAG methods, testing them on two real-use cases (power screwdriver and CubeSat) for tasks involving relationship identification and component discovery.

Result: The analysis highlights computational and design challenges but uncovers promising opportunities for automated DSM generation, presenting quantitative performance results for each DSM element and overall architectural assessment.

Conclusion: Despite inherent challenges, automated DSM generation showcases potential, with publicly available code to validate methodology and invite feedback from domain experts for refinement.

Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) for generating Design Structure Matrices (DSMs). We test these methods on two distinct use cases -- a power screwdriver and a CubeSat with known architectural references -- evaluating their performance on two key tasks: determining relationships between predefined components, and the more complex challenge of identifying components and their subsequent relationships. We measure the performance by assessing each element of the DSM and overall architecture. Despite design and computational challenges, we identify opportunities for automated DSM generation, with all code publicly available for reproducibility and further feedback from the domain experts.

### [3] [Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716)
*Song-Ju Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive systems reusing a single-state across contexts inevitably encounter contextuality, challenging representation capabilities within classical probabilistic frameworks due to irreducible information-theoretic costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the representational limitations and consequences of single-state reuse in adaptive systems operating across multiple contexts, and to clarify how classical and nonclassical frameworks handle contextuality.

Method: The authors model contexts as interventions on a shared internal state, proving through theoretical analysis that classical models incur irreducible information-theoretic costs when reproducing contextual outcome statistics.

Result: The paper demonstrates contextuality as inevitable in classical probabilistic models under single-state reuse, confirms the information-theoretic costs, and provides a constructive example to illustrate this phenomenon.

Conclusion: Contextuality emerges as a fundamental representational constraint on adaptive intelligence in classical systems, while nonclassical frameworks overcome these limitations by avoiding a global joint probability space.

Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.

### [4] [Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16727)
*Hua Yan,Heng Tan,Yingxue Zhang,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobCache is a framework that enhances large-scale human mobility simulations efficiently and effectively by utilizing reconstructible caches and lightweight decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the efficiency and scalability of large-scale human mobility simulations, which are critical for various applications, by mitigating the high computational cost of using large language models (LLMs).

Method: MobCache integrates a reasoning component to reuse reasoning steps through latent-space embeddings and a decoding component which uses constrained distillation to translate reasoning chains into natural language, optimizing simulation fidelity and cost.

Result: MobCache demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining comparable performance to current LLM-based methodologies.

Conclusion: MobCache provides a scalable and efficient solution for human mobility simulation, showcasing its potential for widespread application without compromising on accuracy or realism.

Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

### [5] [When AI Benchmarks Plateau: A Systematic Study of Benchmark Saturation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16763)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes benchmark saturation in 60 LLM benchmarks, identifies factors contributing to it, and suggests design choices for longer-lasting evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the issue of benchmark saturation, which hampers the ability to measure progress and distinguish performance among top LLM models as benchmarks age, reducing their long-term value.

Method: The research analyzed 60 benchmarks on various properties, tested five hypotheses related to saturation, and compared expert-curated to crowdsourced benchmarks to understand factors driving saturation.

Result: The study found that almost half of the benchmarks experience saturation, especially as they age. Expert-curated benchmarks are more resistant to saturation, while hiding test data does not significantly help reduce it.

Conclusion: Design choices, such as using expert curation over crowdsourcing, can improve benchmark longevity. The work provides insights to guide the development of more durable AI evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.

### [6] [Simple Baselines are Competitive with Code Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16805)
*Yonatan Gideoni,Sebastian Risi,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of code evolution pipelines compared to simpler baselines across three domains. It finds simpler methods perform as well or better in some cases, emphasizing shortcomings in current code evolution practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if complex code evolution methods are necessary or if simpler baselines suffice, and to identify limitations in current code evolution techniques.

Method: The authors tested two simple baselines against sophisticated code evolution pipelines across three domains: mathematical bounds, agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. They also analyzed search space design, evaluation stochasticity, and scaffolding methods.

Result: Simple baselines matched or exceeded performance of advanced code evolution techniques in all tested domains. It was observed that factors like search space design and reduction of stochastic evaluation often make a bigger impact.

Conclusion: Simpler methods can outperform sophisticated methods in certain cases. There is a need for better-designed search spaces, reduced evaluation stochasticity, and improved practices for enabling rigorous code evolution methods.

Abstract: Code evolution is a family of techniques that rely on large language models to search through possible computer programs by evolving or mutating existing code. Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.

### [7] [Improved Upper Bounds for Slicing the Hypercube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16807)
*Duncan Soiffer,Nathaniel Itty,Christopher D. Rosin,Blake Bruell,Mason DiCicco,Gábor N. Sárközy,Ryan Offstein,Daniel Reichman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves the upper bound on the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube ($S(n)$) to $\lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, with exceptions for certain $n$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the understanding and bounds of a mathematical problem related to hyperplanes intersecting $n$-dimensional hypercube edges, as the existing upper bound ($\lceil \frac{5n}{6} \rceil$) has remained since 1971.

Method: The authors construct hyperplanes for various cases, utilizing $8$ hyperplanes to slice $Q_{10}$, aided by the newly developed tool CPro1 that combines reasoning LLMs with hyperparameter optimization.

Result: New bounds are established: $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, with an exception for $n$ being an odd multiple of $5$. Additionally, lower bounds on edges sliced by fewer hyperplanes are provided.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective improvement over a long-standing mathematical bound, leveraging advanced tools (CPro1) to aid in finding computational solutions.

Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k<n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.

### [8] [NeuDiff Agent: A Governed AI Workflow for Single-Crystal Neutron Crystallography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16812)
*Zhongcan Xiao,Leyi Zhang,Guannan Zhang,Xiaoping Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuDiff Agent, an AI-driven workflow, streamlines complex data analysis in crystallography, significantly reducing time while ensuring reliable and validated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale scientific facilities face delays in processing data due to complexity in sample analyses requiring iterative procedures. Faster and more reliable solutions are needed.

Method: NeuDiff Agent uses AI workflows restricted to approved tools, incorporates validation gates, governance protocols, and tracks provenance for audits. It was tested on TOPAZ instrument data with two large language model backends.

Result: NeuDiff Agent achieved a time reduction from 435 minutes (manual) to approximately 86-94 minutes (5x faster) while yielding validated outputs without major CheckCIF errors.

Conclusion: Agentic AI like NeuDiff Agent demonstrates promising efficiency gains in facility crystallography workflows while meeting validation and traceability standards.

Abstract: Large-scale facilities increasingly face analysis and reporting latency as the limiting step in scientific throughput, particularly for structurally and magnetically complex samples that require iterative reduction, integration, refinement, and validation. To improve time-to-result and analysis efficiency, NeuDiff Agent is introduced as a governed, tool-using AI workflow for TOPAZ at the Spallation Neutron Source that takes instrument data products through reduction, integration, refinement, and validation to a validated crystal structure and a publication-ready CIF. NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay. Performance is assessed using a fixed prompt protocol and repeated end-to-end runs with two large language model backends, with user and machine time partitioned and intervention burden and recovery behaviors quantified under gating. In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts. These results establish a practical route to deploy agentic AI in facility crystallography while preserving traceability and publication-facing validation requirements.

### [9] [Node Learning: A Framework for Adaptive, Decentralised and Collaborative Network Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16814)
*Eiman Kanjo,Mustafa Aslanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Node Learning', a decentralized approach for AI at the edge, aiming to overcome limitations of centralized intelligence by enabling edge nodes to learn independently and collaborate selectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI faces challenges like high costs, latency, energy consumption, and inefficient scaling for edge and resource-constrained environments.

Method: The paper introduces a new paradigm where edge nodes locally process data, maintain their model states, engage in selective peer learning, and propagate knowledge via diffusion rather than global synchronization.

Result: The paper establishes the conceptual foundation of Node Learning and explores its implications for communication, trust, hardware, and governance in a decentralized AI ecosystem.

Conclusion: Node Learning offers a unified framework for autonomous and cooperative intelligence at the edge while complementing existing approaches by integrating decentralization into AI systems.

Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective

### [10] [An order-oriented approach to scoring hesitant fuzzy elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16827)
*Luis Merino,Gabriel Navarro,Carlos Salvatierra,Evangelina Santos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes hesitant fuzzy sets and provides a unified framework for scoring based on order theory, introducing dominance functions for ranking and supporting group decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for scoring hesitant fuzzy sets lack formal foundations in order theory, creating inconsistencies and limitations in decision-making applications.

Method: The authors adopt an order-oriented perspective, exploring classical orders and developing dominance functions for comparing hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets.

Result: They prove symmetric orders adhere to key normative criteria and introduce dominance functions as practical tools for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements and constructing fuzzy preference relations.

Conclusion: This framework enhances scoring mechanisms' flexibility and coherence, aiding group decision-making by addressing deficiencies in prior approaches.

Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.

### [11] [IndicJR: A Judge-Free Benchmark of Jailbreak Robustness in South Asian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16832)
*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Sanchari Chowdhuri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces Indic Jailbreak Robustness (IJR) as a benchmark to evaluate safety alignment of LLMs in 12 Indic languages, revealing vulnerabilities under different adversarial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment of large language models is under-evaluated across multilingual settings, specifically Indic and South Asian languages, with existing evaluations mostly restricted to English.

Method: The research employs 45,216 prompts across JSON (contract-bound) and Free (naturalistic) tracks to analyze the adversarial robustness of LLaMA, Sarvam, and other models in 12 Indic languages.

Result: Key findings include inflated refusals in contract-bound scenarios that fail to prevent jailbreaks, strong transferability of English attacks to Indic languages, and reduced jailbreak success rates in romanized inputs under certain constraints.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights hidden vulnerabilities in multilingual LLM safety evaluations, emphasizing the importance of addressing regional-specific challenges, especially in Indic languages.

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is mostly evaluated in English and contract-bound, leaving multilingual vulnerabilities understudied. We introduce \textbf{Indic Jailbreak Robustness (IJR)}, a judge-free benchmark for adversarial safety across 12 Indic and South Asian languages (2.1 Billion speakers), covering 45216 prompts in JSON (contract-bound) and Free (naturalistic) tracks.
  IJR reveals three patterns. (1) Contracts inflate refusals but do not stop jailbreaks: in JSON, LLaMA and Sarvam exceed 0.92 JSR, and in Free all models reach 1.0 with refusals collapsing. (2) English to Indic attacks transfer strongly, with format wrappers often outperforming instruction wrappers. (3) Orthography matters: romanized or mixed inputs reduce JSR under JSON, with correlations to romanization share and tokenization (approx 0.28 to 0.32) indicating systematic effects. Human audits confirm detector reliability, and lite-to-full comparisons preserve conclusions. IJR offers a reproducible multilingual stress test revealing risks hidden by English-only, contract-focused evaluations, especially for South Asian users who frequently code-switch and romanize.

(2) Unified Enhancement of Agent Capabilities: we use a unified thought-synthesis pipeline to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, while placing particular emphasis on improving key agent abilities, including Tool/MCP use, memory and multi-agent adaptation; (3) Multi-platform Environment RL Scaling: We propose a new environment RL algorithm, MRPO, to address the challenges of multi-platform conflicts and the low training efficiency of long-horizon tasks. The GUI-Owl-1.5 models are open-sourced, and an online cloud-sandbox demo is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

### [13] [OpenSage: Self-programming Agent Generation Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16891)
*Hongwei Li,Zhun Wang,Qinrun Dai,Yuzhou Nie,Jinjun Peng,Ruitong Liu,Jingyang Zhang,Kaijie Zhu,Jingxuan He,Lun Wang,Yangruibo Ding,Yueqi Chen,Wenbo Guo,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenSage, an agent development kit (ADK) allowing large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create agents with self-generated topology, toolsets, and memory, achieving higher generalizability and performance compared to current ADKs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADKs lack sufficient functional support or require extensive human input, limiting the ability to design adaptive and high-performing agents. The authors aim to develop an enhanced ADK to overcome these limitations.

Method: OpenSage enables LLMs to autonomously generate agents' topology and toolsets while equipping them with a hierarchical, graph-based memory system. It allows agents to manage sub-agents and features specialized tools for software engineering tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art benchmarks show OpenSage's superior performance over existing ADKs, with clear evidence of improvements through rigorous ablation studies for its components.

Conclusion: OpenSage marks a shift in agent development, paving the way for AI-driven agent designs with enhanced autonomy, functionality, and efficiency.

Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.

### [14] [AgentLAB: Benchmarking LLM Agents against Long-Horizon Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16901)
*Tanqiu Jiang,Yuhui Wang,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentLAB, a benchmark to evaluate LLM agent vulnerabilities to long-horizon attacks using novel attack types in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the risk of long-horizon attacks in LLM agents, which exploit multi-turn interactions to achieve harmful objectives, a challenge unmet by single-turn security measures.

Method: The authors develop AgentLAB, a benchmark that supports five attack types (intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning) across 28 environments and 644 test cases. It evaluates LLM agents' response to these adaptive attacks.

Result: Results show that LLM agents are vulnerable to long-horizon attacks, and existing single-turn defenses are ineffective against these threats.

Conclusion: AgentLAB is proposed as a crucial tool for improving the security of LLM agents in complex, real-world applications by enabling the benchmarking of vulnerabilities and defenses against long-horizon risks.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed in long-horizon, complex environments to solve challenging problems, but this expansion exposes them to long-horizon attacks that exploit multi-turn user-agent-environment interactions to achieve objectives infeasible in single-turn settings. To measure agent vulnerabilities to such risks, we present AgentLAB, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating LLM agent susceptibility to adaptive, long-horizon attacks. Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats. We anticipate that AgentLAB will serve as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings. The benchmark is publicly available at https://tanqiujiang.github.io/AgentLAB_main.

TL;DR: LLM-Wikirace is a benchmark testing the planning, reasoning, and world knowledge of large language models through step-by-step navigation on Wikipedia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that effectively evaluates LLMs' planning, reasoning, and use of world knowledge in navigating complex tasks.

Method: Developed a benchmark task requiring models to traverse Wikipedia links from a source to a target page, with performance evaluated on different difficulty levels.

Result: Gemini-3 and other advanced models showed strong performance on easy tasks but struggled significantly on harder tasks, showing limitations in planning and adaptive reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in long-horizon reasoning and replanning, exposing areas for improvement in planning-capable systems. LLM-Wikirace can guide future advancements.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.

### [16] [Narrow fine-tuning erodes safety alignment in vision-language agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16931)
*Idhant Gulati,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies the challenges in ensuring safety alignment when fine-tuning vision-language models on harmful data and demonstrates how misalignment from such tuning can generalize broadly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research is to explore how continuously adapting multimodal agents to new tasks can affect the safety alignment of these models, particularly when fine-tuned on harmful datasets.

Method: Authors conducted experiments on the Gemma3-4B model, analyzing the effects of fine-tuning with various levels of harmful data. They used multimodal and unimodal evaluations to measure alignment degradation and explored geometric properties of harmful behavior spaces.

Result: The study found that fine-tuning on harmful data induces significant safety misalignment, which scales with model dimensionality. Harmful behaviors were found to occupy a low-dimensional subspace, and both multimodal evaluations revealed higher misalignment compared to text-only evaluations.

Conclusion: Existing continual learning methods are insufficient to fully preserve safety alignment in vision-language models post-deployment. The research calls for robust new frameworks to address these challenges.

Abstract: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.

### [17] [DeepContext: Stateful Real-Time Detection of Multi-Turn Adversarial Intent Drift in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16935)
*Justin Albrethsen,Yash Datta,Kunal Kumar,Sharath Rajasekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepContext is a stateful monitoring framework that uses RNNs to tackle adversarial bypasses in multi-turn dialogues, achieving superior performance in detecting jailbreak attempts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the 'Safety Gap' in stateless safety mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs), where adversarial tactics exploit turn-to-turn lack of context to bypass filters.

Method: DeepContext employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach to track user intent over multiple dialogue turns by propagating hidden states, enabling temporal awareness.

Result: DeepContext outperforms leading models in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving an F1 score of 0.84, surpassing other models like Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 and Granite-Guardian. It also performs inference in under 20ms.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal awareness using RNN-based methods like DeepContext is more effective and computationally efficient than employing stateless solutions for ensuring safety in multi-turn dialogues.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have scaled, safety guardrails remain largely stateless, treating multi-turn dialogues as a series of disconnected events. This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SourceBench, a benchmark for evaluating the quality of sources cited by large language models (LLMs) across different query types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of emphasis on evidence quality in LLM evaluations, particularly focusing on the quality of cited web sources.

Method: Development of SourceBench, an eight-metric evaluation framework assessing content quality (relevance, accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (freshness, authority, etc.), along with human-labeled datasets and calibrated LLM-based evaluators.

Result: Eight LLMs, Google Search, and AI search tools were evaluated on SourceBench, revealing key insights for improving GenAI and web search capabilities.

Conclusion: SourceBench provides a robust framework for assessing source quality and opens new directions for enhancing LLM performance in citing reliable, high-quality evidence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly answer queries by citing web sources, but existing evaluations emphasize answer correctness rather than evidence quality. We introduce SourceBench, a benchmark for measuring the quality of cited web sources across 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. SourceBench uses an eight-metric framework covering content quality (content relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (e.g., freshness, authority/accountability, clarity), and includes a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments closely. We evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources using SourceBench and conduct further experiments to understand the evaluation results. Overall, our work reveals four key new insights that can guide future research in the direction of GenAI and web search.

### [19] [Mind the GAP: Text Safety Does Not Transfer to Tool-Call Safety in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16943)
*Arnold Cartagena,Ariane Teixeira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text-level safety evaluations do not guarantee tool-call safety in large language models interacting with external systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical gap of understanding whether alignment suppressing harmful text also suppresses harmful actions through tool calls.

Method: Introduced the GAP benchmark to systematically evaluate the divergence between text-level safety and tool-call safety in LLM agents across various regulated domains, jailbreak scenarios, system prompts, and models.

Result: Observed significant divergence between text safety and tool-call safety. Text refusal often co-exists with harmful tool actions, even under reinforced safety prompts.

Conclusion: Text-only safety measures are insufficient; dedicated methodologies are required to ensure tool-call safety in LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.

TL;DR: The paper investigates differences in pull request (PR) styles created by AI coding agents and their impact on human reviewer responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI coding agents' pull request description styles affect reviewer interaction and merge outcomes in collaborative software development.

Method: An empirical analysis of pull requests from five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset, focusing on structural features, reviewer engagement, sentiment, timing, and outcomes.

Result: AI coding agents have distinct pull request styles, influencing reviewer engagement, response timing, sentiment, and merge success rates.

Conclusion: AI pull request description styles and human reviewer interaction dynamics play a crucial role in collaborative software development.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models has led to the emergence of AI coding agents that autonomously create pull requests on GitHub. However, how these agents differ in their pull request description characteristics, and how human reviewers respond to them, remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset. We analyze agent differences in pull request description characteristics, including structural features, and examine human reviewer response in terms of review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes. We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates. These findings highlight the role of pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics in human-AI collaborative software development.

*Hejia Zhang,Zhongming Yu,Chia-Tung Ho,Haoxing Ren,Brucek Khailany,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4Cov, a framework for training execution-aware LLM agents offline, addressing the challenges of expensive and slow feedback in tool-driven tasks like hardware verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in online reinforcement learning due to the high cost and inefficiency of feedback, especially in domains like hardware verification reliant on industrial simulators.

Method: LLM4Cov reforms verification tasks into state transitions governed by deterministic feedback, employing techniques like execution-validated data curation, policy-aware data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling.

Result: The framework achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate on a benchmark with a 4B-parameter model, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and rivaling much larger models.

Conclusion: LLM4Cov demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of offline execution-aware learning, reducing reliance on costly tool feedback and setting a new standard in verification tasks.

Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.

*Xinhao Deng,Jiaqing Wu,Miao Chen,Yue Xiao,Ke Xu,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Phantom, an automated framework for agent hijacking in Large Language Model ecosystems, leveraging structured template injection to exploit fundamental architectural weaknesses of LLM agents. Experiments show high attack success rates and practical vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the identified critical threat of agent hijacking in LLM ecosystems by OWASP and improve upon existing attacks that show low success rates and poor transferability to closed-source models.

Method: The method introduces Structured Template Injection to exploit chat template tokens for role confusion. Phantom combines template augmentation with a Template Autoencoder (TAE) and Bayesian optimization to identify optimal attack templates with high transferability against black-box agents.

Result: Phantom achieves superior attack success rates and query efficiency compared to existing methods, identifying over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products.

Conclusion: Phantom demonstrates the severity of structured template-based hijacking, providing critical insights for securing agentic systems through its high efficacy and identification of vulnerabilities in deployed products.

Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.

*Srikumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HQFS integrates forecasting, optimization, and auditability into a single process, using quantum and classical methods to improve financial risk decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for stable decision-making in financial risk systems under real-world constraints, providing better predictions, faster optimizations, and auditability.

Method: Developing HQFS, which incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQC) for prediction, QUBO solvers (quantum/classical) for optimization, and post-quantum signatures for traceable decisions.

Result: HQFS achieved lower prediction error (7.8% for returns, 6.1% for volatility) and improved decision metrics (9.4% higher Sharpe ratio, 11.7% lower maximum drawdown). It also reduced optimization time by 28%.

Conclusion: HQFS demonstrates the practical application of quantum and hybrid methods to financial risk systems, showing significant improvements in performance, stability, and traceability.

Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.

*Vishal Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores limitations of black-box evaluations for AI safety, showing they fail under specific complex conditions, and discusses needed safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the fundamental limits of black-box safety evaluations and improve understanding on how these systems might fail in deployment scenarios.

Method: Develops theoretical frameworks and proofs, including minimax lower bounds, adaptive query analysis, and uses computational assumptions to highlight issues.

Result: Proves black-box evaluations cannot reliably estimate deployment risk under certain settings and quantifies worst-case errors. Discusses safeguards that are mathematically necessary.

Conclusion: Black-box safety evaluations are sometimes statistically inadequate, necessitating additional safeguards for AI systems to ensure safety in deployment environments.

Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Conv-FinRe, a benchmark for evaluating stock recommendation models beyond simply imitating user behavior. It incorporates investor goals, risk preferences, and broader decision-making standards across real market and user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendation models for financial advisory often rely on imitating user actions, which may be noisy or short-sighted under volatile conditions. The authors identify the need for a benchmark that evaluates models on their decision quality rather than behavior-matching alone.

Method: Conv-FinRe introduces a longitudinal benchmark combining onboarding interviews, contextual advisory dialogues, and real-market data to evaluate stock recommendation models. Multi-view references are employed to assess whether models mimic noise, follow investor preferences, or align with market rationale.

Result: Conv-FinRe evaluations show a trade-off: models optimized for utility-based rationality do not align well with user behavior, while behaviorally aligned models tend to overfit short-term volatility. The benchmark's dataset and codebase are publicly available for wider use.

Conclusion: The study highlights the discrepancy between behavioral imitation and rational decision-making in financial advisory systems. Conv-FinRe provides a robust platform for assessing and advancing recommendation models by focusing on investor-centric and utility-driven outcomes.

Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist non-expert users in extracting meaningful information from massive temporal records, addressing gaps in Text-to-SQL methods and time series models, which struggle with morphological intents and ultra-long histories.

Method: The study introduces Sonar-TS, which follows a Search-Then-Verify pipeline using SQL-based window searches and Python programs for candidate verification against raw time series signals. It also introduces NLQTSBench for evaluation.

Result: Sonar-TS successfully handles complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail, as demonstrated through experiments with the newly introduced NLQTSBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Sonar-TS establishes an effective benchmark and framework for NLQ4TSDB, presenting a significant step forward in facilitating research and resolving challenges in querying time series databases.

Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cinder, a fast and fair matchmaking system for multiplayer online games, addressing challenges in balancing lobbies of varying skill levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in matchmaking between pre-made teams with diverse skill levels, ensuring fair and satisfying gameplay for players.

Method: The system has two stages: first, lobbies are filtered using the Ruzicka similarity index based on skill range; second, fairness is further assessed using an innovative metric involving skill buckets and the Kantorovich distance.

Result: Cinder successfully evaluated 140 million simulated lobby pairings using Sanction Scores, establishing solid metrics for matchmaking fairness thresholds.

Conclusion: Cinder improves matchmaking fairness and speed, providing a robust framework for multiplayer online games by addressing issues in heterogeneity and skill distribution.

Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.

*Zichen Wang,Wanli Ma,Zhenyu Ming,Gong Zhang,Kun Yuan,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces M2F, a framework for formalizing entire textbooks into Lean code, achieving significant automation success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formalizing mathematical content allows for mechanical verification but is limited by challenges in handling large-scale projects.

Method: Two stages: 1) Statement compilation - splits and manages dependencies, ensuring project compiles with proof placeholders. 2) Proof repair - fills proof holes using local goal-conditioned edits verified by tool feedback.

Result: M2F formalized 479 pages of textbooks into 153,853 lines of Lean code in three weeks, achieving 96% proof success compared to baseline 80%.

Conclusion: This framework showcases that large-scale, automated formalization of mathematical literature is feasible, saving significant time.

Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach.

Result: The Sales Research Agent outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 and ChatGPT-5 in qualitative scoring across various customer-oriented metrics.

Conclusion: The AI system and benchmark offer enterprises a robust solution for assessing AI reliability and improving CRM data reasoning and decision-making insights.

Abstract: Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can answer sales-leader questions over live, customized CRM data, but most available models do not expose transparent, repeatable evidence of quality. This paper describes the Sales Research Agent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, an AI-first application that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and produces decision-ready insights through text and chart outputs. To make quality observable, we introduce the Sales Research Bench, a purpose-built benchmark that scores systems on eight customer-weighted dimensions, including text and chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, and chart quality. In a 200-question run on a customized enterprise schema on October 19, 2025, the Sales Research Agent outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 by 13 points and ChatGPT-5 by 24.1 points on the 100-point composite score, giving customers a repeatable way to compare AI solutions.

### [30] [Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17038)
*Shengtian Yang,Yu Li,Shuo He,Yewen Li,Qingpeng Cai,Peng Jiang,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE) to address simplicity bias in RL methods by using a phase-aware routing system for better specialization in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the simplicity bias in RL methods, which arises when simple tasks dominate gradient updates and leave insufficient capacity for complex tasks.

Method: The proposed PA-MoE employs a lightweight phase router to learn latent phase boundaries from the RL objective and allocates temporally consistent phase-specific assignments to experts.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PA-MoE in enhancing parameter specialization and addressing simplicity bias.

Conclusion: PA-MoE successfully addresses simplicity bias in RL by preserving phase-specific expertise through phase-aware routing, enhancing task specialization and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \emph{single} policy network, causing \emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.

### [31] [Dynamic System Instructions and Tool Exposure for Efficient Agentic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17046)
*Uria Franko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method named Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR) that dynamically minimizes prompts and toolsets per step, reducing cost and improving performance for large language model agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inefficiencies in LLM agents, such as high costs, errors, and latency due to excessive system prompts and large tool catalogs being re-ingested every step.

Method: ITR retrieves and composes minimal system-prompt fragments and necessary tool subsets for each step, including confidence-gated fallbacks to produce a dynamic runtime system prompt.

Result: ITR reduces context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and lowers episode costs by 70%, enabling agents to conduct 2-20x more loops within context limits.

Conclusion: The method enhances performance and cost efficiency in long-running autonomous agents, particularly benefiting scenarios with extensive agent steps.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents often run for many steps while re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each turn. This increases cost, agent derailment probability, latency, and tool-selection errors. We propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG variant that retrieves, per step, only the minimal system-prompt fragments and the smallest necessary subset of tools. ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents. We detail the method, evaluation protocol, ablations, and operational guidance for practical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentCUA is a multi-agent framework for desktop automation that uses intent-aligned plan memory to improve long-horizon task performance by reducing error propagation and redundant work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in desktop automation often face inefficiency and errors due to noisy perceptions and evolving contexts, leading to a need for systems that better align with user intent over long task horizons.

Method: The framework consists of a Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic working over shared memory with multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. Intent prototypes retrieve skills to enhance partial plans, reducing redundancy and errors.

Result: IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate and a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, surpassing RL-based and trajectory-focused approaches. Ablations confirmed the impact of intent abstraction and shared plan memory on performance.

Conclusion: Multi-view intent abstraction and memory-based coordination are key to achieving stable, efficient computer-use automation, making IntentCUA an effective solution for large, dynamic desktop environments.

Abstract: Computer-use agents operate over long horizons under noisy perception, multi-window contexts, evolving environment states. Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks. These results highlight that system-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments.

### [33] [RFEval: Benchmarking Reasoning Faithfulness under Counterfactual Reasoning Intervention in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17053)
*Yunseok Han,Yejoon Lee,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce reasoning that sounds plausible but isn't faithful to their decision process. The paper introduces an evaluation framework, RFEval, which assesses faithfulness using two criteria: stance consistency and causal influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study addresses the challenge of ensuring that the reasoning generated by LRMs is faithful to their actual decision-making process, promoting trust and reliability in AI systems.

Method: The authors propose a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness and develop RFEval, a benchmark designed to test faithfulness by using controlled counterfactual interventions across multiple tasks.

Result: Evaluations reveal that nearly half (49.7%) of LRM outputs are unfaithful, largely due to stance inconsistency. Faithfulness issues are particularly prominent in domains like math and code, and post-training objectives can worsen faithfulness despite preserved accuracy.

Conclusion: Accuracy alone is an insufficient indicator of faithfulness. Reliable AI systems require not only correct answers but also structurally faithful reasoning processes. The paper establishes a foundation for auditing and improving reasoning faithfulness in LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach called Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q) to improve cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning by enabling adaptability and persistent exploration during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value decomposition methods in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning struggle with adaptability when value functions shift dynamically, often resulting in suboptimal policies.

Method: The method introduces Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions. These are incorporated into a Softmax-based behavior policy to facilitate exploration and accommodate shifting value optima.

Result: Experimental results show that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms on challenging benchmarks, achieving better adaptability and performance.

Conclusion: S2Q improves MARL adaptability by learning alternative high-value actions and encouraging exploration, and proves superior to existing approaches in experimental testing.

Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

*Sumedh Rasal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS) optimizes language model training by focusing on high-loss samples, achieving faster convergence with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and convergence speed of language models without requiring expensive computations or predefined difficulty metrics.

Method: PBS uses a lightweight linear predictor, trained online, to estimate sample difficulty from token-level features like token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio.

Result: Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer show PBS accelerates convergence by 6-13% and improves predictor correlation to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps.

Conclusion: Token frequency statistics effectively encode sample difficulty for training optimization, making PBS an efficient and practical approach to curriculum learning.

Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.

### [36] [Agentic Wireless Communication for 6G: Intent-Aware and Continuously Evolving Physical-Layer Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17096)
*Zhaoyang Li,Xingzhi Jin,Junyu Pan,Qianqian Yang,Zhiguo Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in 6G wireless systems to enable intent-driven communications, and presents a case study of the AgenCom agent for intent-aware link decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing complexity and dynamics in 6G systems, necessitating a shift from static, rule-based approaches to adaptive, intent-driven intelligence for meeting multidimensional user requirements.

Method: The study examines the role of large language models in enabling intent perception, autonomous decision-making, and network execution through a closed-loop approach. It also includes a case study on an LLM-based agent, AgenCom, for adaptive link decision-making.

Result: The paper demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of using LLM-based agents to integrate user intent and environmental dynamics for more responsive and efficient 6G physical-layer solutions.

Conclusion: LLM-based agentic AI offers a promising pathway to achieving intent-aware and adaptive systems for the 6G physical layer, despite challenges in multimodal perception and sustainable decision-making.

Abstract: As 6G wireless systems evolve, growing functional complexity and diverse service demands are driving a shift from rule-based control to intent-driven autonomous intelligence. User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.
  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.
  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-AI collaboration framework to standardize sustainability ratings across agencies using principled criteria and AI-powered approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is inconsistency in sustainability ratings from different agencies, which affects their comparability and credibility, limiting their value in decision-making.

Method: Proposes a framework consisting of two components: STRIDE to create benchmark datasets, and SR-Delta to analyze discrepancies in ratings using large language models.

Result: The framework enables scalable and comparable assessments, thereby improving the reliability of sustainability ratings and methodologies.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for the AI community to adopt AI-powered frameworks to improve sustainability rating methodologies and better support global sustainability initiatives.

Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating & Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.

*Xiangyu Zhou,Chenhan Xiao,Yang Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving Shapley value-based methods for XAI by proposing O-Shap, a new segmentation approach that satisfies the T-property for better accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley value methods are limited in vision tasks due to feature dependencies, and existing grouping methods violate consistency properties, calling for better feature group-based techniques.

Method: The authors introduce a segmentation approach adhering to the T-property, which ensures semantic alignment in feature hierarchies to improve Owen value-based attributions.

Result: O-Shap demonstrates superior attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency on image and tabular datasets compared to baseline SHAP implementations.

Conclusion: By addressing hierarchical feature dependencies with the T-property, O-Shap enhances attribution accuracy and interpretability in XAI tasks, particularly in structured environments.

Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.

### [39] [Instructor-Aligned Knowledge Graphs for Personalized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17111)
*Abdulrahman AlRabah,Priyanka Kargupta,Jiawei Han,Abdussalam Alawini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstructKG, a framework for constructing knowledge graphs from course materials to capture learning progressions and dependencies, aiding personalized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In large-scale courses, diagnosing student misunderstandings and identifying concepts that need reinforcement is impractical for instructors. Existing methods fail to capture in-depth pedagogical relationships in course content.

Method: InstructKG constructs instructor-aligned knowledge graphs from lecture materials by extracting significant concepts (nodes) and learning dependencies (edges), leveraging semantic and temporal signals along with large language models.

Result: Experiments with diverse courses and human evaluation show that InstructKG effectively represents rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions and captures meaningful relationships within educational materials.

Conclusion: InstructKG is a powerful tool for automatic knowledge graph generation, enabling personalized educational approaches by accurately mapping course relationships and supporting targeted learning interventions.

Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.

*Ilya Levin*

TL;DR: This paper proposes an 'Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces' to understand how generative AI produces knowledge, introducing a novel paradigm that breaks from traditional computational approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the epistemic gap in understanding the mechanisms behind generative AI, which is critical for its responsible integration into science, education, and institutions.

Method: The paper analyzes neural network architectures and high-dimensional geometry, leveraging concepts from Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, to conceptualize a new framework for investigating generative AI.

Result: It develops an Indexical Epistemology that redefines how generative models operate, emphasizing their role as navigators of learned semantic manifolds of high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: Generative AI necessitates a new epistemic paradigm distinct from traditional symbolic reasoning and statistical approaches, fundamentally shaping our knowledge production systems.

Abstract: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.

Motivation: The need for effective solutions to manage increasing size, power use, and execution time in advanced CNNs.

Method: Introduce Combine as a criterion-based pruning framework with standard language and novel criterion functions.

Result: Achieved up to 79% filter pruning, retaining or improving accuracy, and reduced computational load by 68% using VGG-inspired models.

Conclusion: Combine is a fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, offering a standard language for comparisons and demonstrating various criterion impacts.

Abstract: As the need for more accurate and powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) increases, so too does the size, execution time, memory footprint, and power consumption. To overcome this, solutions such as pruning have been proposed with their own metrics and methodologies, or criteria, for how weights should be removed. These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions. We show the capacity of these criterion functions and the framework on VGG inspired models, pruning up to 79\% of filters while retaining or improving accuracy, and reducing the computations needed by the network by up to 68\%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JEPA-DNA, a novel framework integrating Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with MLM/NTP for better genomic understanding by focusing on high-level functional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional genomic foundation models using MLM or NTP fail to capture broader functional contexts necessary for global biological insights.

Method: JEPA-DNA combines token-level recovery with a predictive latent objective, employing a CLS token for functional embeddings and extending MLM/NTP paradigms.

Result: Evaluation demonstrates JEPA-DNA’s superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to prior generative approaches.

Conclusion: JEPA-DNA provides a biologically robust representation that combines sequence understanding and functional logic, paving the way for improved genomic foundation models.

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.

*Enrique Crespo-Fernandez,Oliver Ray,Telmo de Menezes e Silva Filho,Peter Flach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for symbolic causal world models that enhance efficiency, transparency, and scalability by integrating continuous learning with high-level abstraction generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents often face challenges in navigating complex environments due to the inefficiencies, lack of clarity, and scalability issues in existing world modeling methods.

Method: The framework uses Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to construct symbolic causal world models online, enabling agents to form reusable and meaningful abstractions.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior scalability to handle complex relational dynamics and achieves significantly higher sample efficiency compared to PPO neural network methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances world modeling by enabling agents to efficiently and transparently understand and adapt to complex environments through symbolic abstraction.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating complex environments requires agents to internalize the underlying logic of their world, yet standard world modelling methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability. We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.

*Yi-Chih Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a seven-stage modular workflow for integrating AI in humanities and social science research, using Taiwan's usage data from Claude.ai for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the methodological gap in using generative AI for humanities and social science research, compared to its predominant focus in natural sciences and engineering.

Method: The study proposes a seven-stage AI and human collaborative workflow based on principles like task modularization and human-AI division of labor, validated using empirical data from Claude.ai.

Result: The workflow was applied successfully, identifying three collaboration modes: direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led, while highlighting the importance of human judgment.

Conclusion: The study provides a replicable framework for AI collaboration in research, emphasizing the irreplaceability of human roles in critical research areas, while discussing limitations and risks involved.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping knowledge work, yet existing research focuses predominantly on software engineering and the natural sciences, with limited methodological exploration for the humanities and social sciences. Positioned as a "methodological experiment," this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.
  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).
  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged.

*Ben Yellin,Ehud Ezra,Mark Foreman,Shula Grinapol*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a fine-tuned behavioral foundation model designed to predict individual decision-making based on psychological traits and situational factors, offering significant improvements over prompting-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in predicting consistent and individual-specific decision-making, particularly in complex, high-stakes scenarios that involve psychological and situational interactions.

Method: LBM is a fine-tuned behavioral model that uses high-dimensional trait profiles derived from psychometric data instead of transient persona prompts. It maps psychological profiles to discrete choices through training on a proprietary dataset of strategic dilemmas.

Result: LBM improves behavioral prediction over the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model and performs comparably to advanced baselines using Big Five trait conditioning. Its performance continues to improve with an increase in trait dimensions, unlike prompting-based baselines.

Conclusion: LBM offers a scalable, high-fidelity method for behavioral simulation, making it useful for applications like strategic foresight, negotiation, cognitive security, and decision support.

Abstract: Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.

*Bianca Raimondi,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines Large Language Models' (LLMs) cognitive complexity through internal neural analysis and finds that cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy are linearly separable in the models' representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate and provide deeper insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs' neural representations, addressing their black-box nature by analyzing cognitive complexity through Bloom's Taxonomy.

Method: The researchers analyzed residual stream representations in LLMs using linear classifiers to detect the separability of Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels within the models' high-dimensional activation data.

Result: Linear classifiers achieved ~95% mean accuracy in identifying cognitive levels, indicating that cognitive complexity is encoded in linearly accessible subspaces. This separability increases across model layers.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMs process and encode cognitive complexity early during the forward pass, with increasingly distinct representations of cognitive difficulty in deeper layers.

Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.

### [49] [All Leaks Count, Some Count More: Interpretable Temporal Contamination Detection in LLM Backtesting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17234)
*Zeyu Zhang,Ryan Chen,Bradly C. Stadie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines large language models’ ability to predict past events without leaking later knowledge and presents a framework to measure and reduce such knowledge leakage for reliable evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately assess the predictive capability of large language models on past events, it is critical to prevent the models from using post-event knowledge encoded in their training data.

Method: The authors propose a claim-level framework using Shapley values to quantify knowledge leakage (Shapley-DCLR) and introduce TimeSPEC, a method to ensure time-specific predictions by interleaving claim verification and regeneration.

Result: Experiments on tasks like Supreme Court case predictions, NBA salaries, and stock returns showed significant knowledge leakage in standard approaches, while TimeSPEC reduced leakage while maintaining task performance.

Conclusion: Explicit claim-level verification and filtering (TimeSPEC) enhance the reliability of large language models for backtesting, outperforming traditional prompt-based temporal constraints.

Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.

*Linxi Jiang,Rui Xi,Zhijie Liu,Shuo Chen,Zhiqiang Lin,Suman Nath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Web Verbs,' a semantic layer of web actions that enables efficient, reliable, and auditable workflows for web agents using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents rely on low-level primitives like clicks and keystrokes, which are fragile, inefficient, and hard to verify. The authors aim to address this limitation by creating a higher-level semantic abstraction for web interactions.

Method: The authors propose 'Web Verbs'—a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that standardize site capabilities. These functions abstract user actions into stable units, enabling LLMs to generate reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow.

Result: The authors provide a proof-of-concept implementation and case studies demonstrating the advantages of 'Web Verbs,' including enhanced execution reliability, efficiency, and verifiability compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: 'Web Verbs' unify API-based and browser-based paradigms, achieving reliable and concise workflows for web agents. The paper also outlines steps for standardizing this approach for web-scale deployment.

Abstract: The Web is evolving from a medium that humans browse to an environment where software agents act on behalf of users. Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow. Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces. We present our vision, a proof-of-concept implementation, and representative case studies that demonstrate concise and robust execution compared to existing agents. Finally, we outline a roadmap for standardization to make verbs deployable and trustworthy at web scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide practical insights for researchers aiming to develop domain-specific scientific language models with constrained compute resources.

Method: The authors outline an end-to-end pipeline including metadata filtering, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, tokenization, and transformer training using 2xA100 GPUs.

Result: The study identifies the importance of preprocessing and tokenization in data yield and training stability, and highlights scalability challenges under storage and compute constraints.

Conclusion: The work offers a detailed case study and engineering insights for training small-scale scientific models, stressing transparent processes and challenges for moderate-budget researchers.

Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.

*Hui Min Wong,Philip Heesen,Pascal Janetzky,Martin Bendszus,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedClarify, an AI agent, improves medical diagnoses by iterative questioning and reasoning using information gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in medical reasoning due to incomplete cases and missing information, and improve diagnostic performance.

Method: MedClarify generates follow-up questions based on candidate diagnoses and selects those with the highest expected information gain to support diagnostic decision-making.

Result: MedClarify reduces diagnostic errors by approximately 27 percentage points compared to standard LLMs.

Conclusion: MedClarify enhances medical LLM performance through systematic follow-up questioning, supporting real-world clinical diagnostic processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.

*Angelo Porrello,Pietro Buzzega,Felix Dangel,Thomas Sommariva,Riccardo Salami,Lorenzo Bonicelli,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dataless method to handle representation drift using curvature matrix approximation, achieving state-of-the-art results in task arithmetic while maintaining modularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task modularity in foundation models facilitates adaptation, but combining task vectors can lead to performance degradation due to cross-task interference and representation drift. Existing regularization approaches depend on external data, conflicting with modularity and privacy requirements.

Method: The authors present a dataless regularization method based on framing representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem, using techniques like Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature to achieve scalability and task vector disentanglement.

Result: Their approach shows state-of-the-art performance in task addition and negation, offering robustness and avoiding dependency on held-out data for tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed dataless regularizer effectively mitigates task interference in a scalable and modular manner, making it practical and robust for task adaptation in foundation models.

Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.

*Adrià Molina,Oriol Ramos Terrades,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework integrating formal verification with deep learning-based image retrieval to improve reliability and accuracy in handling complex natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current embedding-based models in handling complex queries involving relationships, compositions, or specific constraints.

Method: Integration of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation to support open-vocabulary natural language queries with verifiable results.

Result: The framework offers trustworthy, verifiable, and transparent retrieval processes by explicitly verifying query constraints against retrieved content.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the reliability and accountability of information retrieval systems, surpassing current limitations in natural language search.

Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.

*Michele Zanitti,Vanja Miskovic,Francesco Trovò,Alessandra Laura Giulia Pedrocchi,Ming Shen,Yan Kyaw Tun,Arsela Prelaj,Sokol Kosta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to predict survival outcomes for NSCLC patients using incomplete, multi-modal clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survival prediction for NSCLC patients is difficult due to diverse prognostic features and incomplete clinical datasets, motivating the need for a robust model that manages missing information effectively across multiple data modalities.

Method: The proposed MCVAE utilizes modality-specific variational encoders, a fusion bottleneck with gating mechanisms, and a multi-task objective combining survival, reconstruction, and contrastive losses. Stochastic modality masking is used during training to improve robustness against missing data.

Result: MCVAE demonstrates superior performance in predicting disease-specific survival and robustness under severe missing data conditions on TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC datasets, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study introduces MCVAE as a robust solution to handle incomplete multimodal NSCLC datasets, suggesting that while multimodal integration can be beneficial, it does not always enhance task performance.

Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Privacy-by-Design framework aimed at ensuring privacy and legal compliance for AI applications used by children, with key focus on privacy principles and protective design strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI technologies by children raises privacy concerns, with companies struggling to meet privacy regulations effectively.

Method: The authors propose a Privacy-by-Design framework that integrates principles from various international privacy laws and stages of AI application development, including guidelines specific to children's needs.

Result: The framework provides actionable steps for AI designers and developers to implement privacy protections using academic insights, and demonstrates its application through a case study on an AI educational tool for children.

Conclusion: The adoption of Privacy-by-Design helps reduce privacy risks, supports legal compliance, and facilitates the creation of AI tools that are safe and privacy-focused for children.

Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.

Abstract: This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.

Conclusion: KG-RAG effectively enhances factual accuracy and reliability for telecom tasks, demonstrating its value in complex and specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.

### [60] [Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544)
*Shashank Aggarwal,Ram Vikas Mishra,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multi-agent IR pipelines that use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in reasoning, introducing two new measures, reusability and verifiability, revealing gaps in accuracy-based evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current CoT evaluations, which focus only on accuracy and fail to assess the reasoning process's quality and utility.

Method: The authors propose two new metrics, reusability and verifiability, using a Thinker-Executor framework for decoupling CoT generation from execution. Experiments involve four Thinker models and ten Executor models across five benchmarks.

Result: Findings show that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with accuracy, and specialized reasoning models do not consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs in these metrics.

Conclusion: Current metrics, like accuracy, inadequately represent reasoning capabilities in multi-agent IR settings. Reusability and verifiability offer more nuanced insights into CoT reasoning quality.

Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.

*Yue Liu,Zhiyuan Hu,Flood Sung,Jiaheng Zhang,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents KLong, an open-source model to solve long-horizon tasks, leveraging trajectory-splitting SFT and progressive RL techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing models capable of solving long-horizon tasks efficiently and effectively.

Method: Introduced the trajectory-splitting SFT and Research-Factory pipeline for generating and handling long-horizon training data. Applied progressive RL for staged training with extended timeouts.

Result: The KLong model outperformed Kimi K2 Thinking by 11.28% on PaperBench and showed generalization improvements across other benchmarks.

Conclusion: KLong demonstrates superior long-horizon task-solving and generalization capabilities, making it successful in challenging, extended tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ODESteer, an ODE-based framework for activation steering in LLM alignment, achieving empirical improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods lack a unified theoretical framework and overly rely on one-step steering, limiting their efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Proposes an ODE-based theoretical framework where steering directions stem from barrier functions, enabling multi-step and adaptive steering.

Result: ODESteer provides consistent improvements across LLM alignment benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in TruthfulQA, UltraFeedback, and RealToxicityPrompts.

Conclusion: The work unifies activation steering's theoretical foundations using ODEs and demonstrates its efficacy through ODESteer, advancing LLM alignment methods.

Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights a novel method to evaluate AI on human-like general intelligence by comparing their ability to play and learn diverse human-designed games. The authors introduce the AI GameStore platform and test seven AI models, finding gaps in AI capabilities relative to human benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks focus narrowly on specific skills and are static, becoming ineffective over time. There's a need for more holistic methods to evaluate AI for general human intelligence.

Method: The researchers propose evaluating AI abilities through general game playing, focusing on all conceivable human games. They introduced the AI GameStore, a platform using LLMs and human input to create diverse game environments for evaluation.

Result: As a proof of concept, the researchers generated 100 games and tested seven vision-language models. The results showed that AI achieved under 10% of human average scores across most games, especially in areas requiring world-modeling, memory, and planning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of the AI GameStore for evaluating AI general intelligence, emphasizing AI's limitations and the need for further development to achieve human-like cognitive abilities.

Abstract: Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.

Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models struggle with low chemical validity and lack effectiveness compared to 1D modeling in molecular generation.

Method: MolHIT leverages the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model and decoupled atom encoding, incorporating chemical priors and role-based atom type distinctions.

Result: New state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset, high validity in graph-based generation, surpassing 1D baselines, and impressive results in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MolHIT addresses limitations of graph diffusion methods, marking a breakthrough in AI-driven drug discovery and materials science applications.

Abstract: Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.

Method: The paper presents "AutoNumerics," a multi-agent system that uses classical numerical analysis principles for solver design. It incorporates a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification system for automated numerical solver design and verification.

Result: Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems show that "AutoNumerics" achieves competitive or better accuracy compared to neural and LLM-based methods. It effectively selects numerical schemes based on the structural properties of the PDEs.

Conclusion: "AutoNumerics" showcases a novel, interpretable, and automated approach to designing accurate numerical solvers for PDEs, overcoming limitations of black-box neural methods and emphasizing classical analysis.

Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.

Result: The lab sets up a framework for semantic relation extraction with an emphasis on multilingual and temporal dimensions.

Conclusion: HIPE-2026 contributes to historical data processing by supporting tasks like knowledge-graph construction and spatial analysis.

Abstract: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of IoT-based remote ECG monitoring systems for early detection of cardiovascular diseases, aiming to improve healthcare access and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible and timely health facilities globally, especially for cardiovascular diseases, by leveraging IoT technology.

Method: The system relies on IoT technology, connecting operators, doctors, and servers to facilitate remote ECG monitoring and telemedicine support for patients.

Result: The implementation of such systems helps detect chronic diseases early, reduces travel and associated costs, and provides timely medical intervention.

Conclusion: IoT-enabled remote ECG monitoring systems significantly enhance accessibility to healthcare, supporting patients in underserved areas and promoting early disease management.

Abstract: With the availability of automation machinery and its superiority, are being slothful and inviting many diseases to invade them. The world still has so many places where people lack basic health facilities. Due to early detection and intervention, CDV can be cured to an extreme extent. It heavily reduces travel and associated costs. A remote ECG monitoring system enables community health workers to support and empower patients through telemedicine. However, there remains some financial and logistical burden. Heart disease cannot be taken lightly. These patients require regular health check-ups and the attention of health personnel in a short period if their health deteriorates suddenly and rapidly. Chronic diseases are extremely variable in their symptoms and evolution of treatment. Some, if not treated early, will end the patient's life. The trend of the INTERNET OF THINGS, IoT, is spreading massively. This paper focuses on the three main: the operator, the doctor, and the server over which the data is being sent.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Canon is a parallel architecture that combines dynamic data-driven orchestration and novel execution strategies to achieve both flexibility and high performance comparable to specialized accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an architecture that achieves the high efficiency of specialized accelerators while maintaining the flexibility of general-purpose architectures in handling irregular or sparse data.

Method: The paper introduces two key innovations: programmable FSMs for dynamic data orchestration and time-lapsed SIMD execution for efficient, staggered pipelined processing.

Result: Canon achieves high performance across diverse kernels and matches the efficiency of specialized accelerators while preserving programmability.

Conclusion: Canon bridges the gap between specialized and general-purpose architectures, offering high performance, efficiency, and adaptability to a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Domain-specific accelerators deliver exceptional performance on their target workloads through fabrication-time orchestrated datapaths. However, such specialized architectures often exhibit performance fragility when exposed to new kernels or irregular input patterns. In contrast, programmable architectures like FPGAs, CGRAs, and GPUs rely on compile-time orchestration to support a broader range of applications; but they are typically less efficient under irregular or sparse data. Pushing the boundaries of programmable architectures requires designs that can achieve efficiency and high-performance on par with specialized accelerators while retaining the agility of general-purpose architectures.
  We introduce Canon, a parallel architecture that bridges the gap between specialized and general purpose architectures. Canon exploits data-level and instruction-level parallelism through its novel design. First, it employs a novel dynamic data-driven orchestration mechanism using programmable Finite State Machines (FSMs). These FSMs are programmed at compile time to encode high-level dataflow per state and translate incoming meta-information (e.g., sparse coordinates) into control instructions at runtime. Second, Canon introduces a time-lapsed SIMD execution in which instructions are issued across a row of processing elements over several cycles, creating a staggered pipelined execution. These innovations amortize control overhead, allowing dynamic instruction changes while constructing a continuously evolving dataflow that maximizes parallelism. Experimental evaluation shows that Canon delivers high performance across diverse data-agnostic and data-driven kernels while achieving efficiency comparable to specialized accelerators, yet retaining the flexibility of a general-purpose architecture.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) often fail to adapt to locally redefined semantics in digital logic contexts, exposing flaws in their reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to investigate LLMs' reliability in settings where operators or semantics are explicitly redefined locally, a critical requirement in formal and hardware documentation contexts.

Method: The authors created a micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks to evaluate the models’ ability to comply with local specifications and tested three advanced LLMs.

Result: Persistent issues were identified in the evaluated LLMs, including failure to comply with local definitions and reliance on pretrained assumptions, even in simple cases.

Conclusion: The study underscores the gap between surface-level and specification-faithful reasoning, advocating for evaluation methods focused on local unlearning and semantic adherence in formal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on standard digital logic and Boolean reasoning tasks, yet their reliability under locally redefined semantics remains poorly understood. In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARTH-PUM, a hybrid architecture combining analog and digital in-memory computing for energy-efficient, general-purpose computation across various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the utility of Analog Processing-Using-Memory (PUM), which has been mainly limited to machine learning inference, into general-purpose computation while addressing limitations of analog PUM in performing non-MVM operations.

Method: The authors design a hybrid PUM architecture named DARTH-PUM by integrating analog and digital PUM, optimizing peripheral circuitry, developing coordination hardware, a user-friendly programming interface, and supporting flexible data widths.

Result: DARTH-PUM demonstrates significant performance improvements in diverse applications, achieving speedups of 59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x for AES encryption, CNNs, and large-language models, respectively, over an analog+CPU baseline.

Conclusion: DARTH-PUM provides a scalable, efficient, and general-purpose PUM solution, showcasing its capability to execute kernels fully in memory and extend its applicability beyond traditional analog PUM limitations.

Abstract: Analog processing-using-memory (PUM; a.k.a. in-memory computing) makes use of electrical interactions inside memory arrays to perform bulk matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations. However, many popular matrix-based kernels need to execute non-MVM operations, which analog PUM cannot directly perform. To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.
  We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM. We propose optimized peripheral circuitry, coordinating hardware to manage and interface between both types of PUM, an easy-to-use programming interface, and low-cost support for flexible data widths. These design elements allow us to build a practical PUM architecture that can execute kernels fully in memory, and can scale easily to cater to domains ranging from embedded applications to large-scale data-driven computing. We show how three popular applications (AES encryption, convolutional neural networks, large-language models) can map to and benefit from DARTH-PUM, with speedups of 59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x over an analog+CPU baseline.

*Kejian Shi,Yixin Liu,Peifeng Wang,Alexander R. Fabbri,Shafiq Joty,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing non-verifiable domains like LLM alignment by using reference-guided LLM evaluators as soft verifiers, demonstrating improvements in alignment tuning and self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards struggles in non-verifiable domains such as LLM alignment due to the lack of ground-truth verifiers. The motivation is to investigate whether reference outputs can act as soft 'verifiers' to aid alignment processes.

Method: The authors leverage reference-guided evaluation protocols to enhance the accuracy of LLM judges. They use references from frontier models and high-quality human-written outputs to guide alignment tuning and self-improvement processes.

Result: The reference-guided approach significantly improves evaluator accuracy and boosts performance metrics in LLM alignment tuning, achieving notable gains over existing methods like direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reference-free self-improvement. Results include substantial performance improvements in benchmarks like AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: Using reference-guided LLM evaluators presents a promising pathway for effective post-training of LLMs in non-verifiable domains, enabling better alignment outcomes and self-improvement methodologies.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong effectiveness in reasoning tasks, it cannot be directly applied to non-verifiable domains lacking ground-truth verifiers, such as LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft "verifiers". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.

### [74] [Evaluating Monolingual and Multilingual Large Language Models for Greek Question Answering: The DemosQA Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16811)
*Charalampos Mastrokostas,Nikolaos Giarelis,Nikos Karacapilidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in studying monolingual models for under-resourced languages with a focus on Greek QA. It introduces a novel dataset (DemosQA), a memory-efficient evaluation framework, and evaluates multiple LLMs against Greek language-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research on monolingual models for under-resourced languages like Greek, and high-resourced languages dominate LLM development. This may lead to biases and misrepresentation of local cultural contexts.

Method: The paper contributes with a new dataset (DemosQA) derived from social media, a memory-efficient framework for evaluating LLMs, and thorough evaluations of various monolingual and multilingual models utilizing different prompting strategies.

Result: The study delivers DemosQA as a culturally representative dataset, demonstrates the utility of a novel evaluation framework, and presents comparative analyses of 11 LLMs on language-specific QA tasks in Greek.

Conclusion: The approach underscores the importance of developing and assessing monolingual LLMs for under-resourced languages to better reflect cultural and linguistic uniqueness, offering reproducible tools and data for further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning have enabled the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art across a wide range of tasks, including Question Answering (QA). Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility.

*Chanhyuk Lee,Jaehoon Yoo,Manan Agarwal,Sheel Shah,Jerry Huang,Aditi Raghunathan,Seunghoon Hong,Nicholas M. Boffi,Jinwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flow-based language model (FLM) that achieves faster and higher-quality generation compared to discrete diffusion models, with successful results in one-step generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion language models promise faster generation but underperform in few-step regimes. The aim is to propose an alternative method that avoids these limitations.

Method: The authors propose FLM, leveraging Euclidean denoising over one-hot encodings, and introduce time reparameterization for stability and quality. They distill FLM into FMLM for efficient few-step generation.

Result: FLM matches state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models in quality, while FMLM outperforms existing few-step models, achieving superior quality even in one-step generation.

Conclusion: Flow-based modeling can be an efficient alternative to discrete diffusion for language generation, challenging existing assumptions and enabling acceleration at scale.

Abstract: Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

### [76] [Claim Automation using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16836)
*Zhengda Mo,Zhiyu Quan,Eli O'Donohue,Kaiwen Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a locally deployed fine-tuned language model (LM) designed to process warranty claims and generate corrective-action recommendations in the insurance domain, showing promising results in domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel in general tasks, their adoption in sensitive regulated domains like insurance is limited. This paper aims to address this gap by focusing on structured recommendations based on unstructured claim narratives.

Method: The authors propose fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on historical warranty claim data. They use a governance-aware framework and evaluate results through both automated metrics and human assessments.

Result: Domain-specific fine-tuning achieves approximately 80% agreement with ground-truth corrective actions and outperforms commercial general-purpose and prompt-based LLMs in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs aligned with specific domains can significantly enhance both utility and accuracy in real-world applications within regulated sectors like insurance, proving their feasibility and reliability.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on general-purpose language tasks, their deployment in regulated and data-sensitive domains, including insurance, remains limited. Leveraging millions of historical warranty claims, we propose a locally deployed governance-aware language modeling component that generates structured corrective-action recommendations from unstructured claim narratives. We fine-tune pretrained LLMs using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), scoping the model to an initial decision module within the claim processing pipeline to speed up claim adjusters' decisions. We assess this module using a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that combines automated semantic similarity metrics with human evaluation, enabling a rigorous examination of both practical utility and predictive accuracy. Our results show that domain-specific fine-tuning substantially outperforms commercial general-purpose and prompt-based LLMs, with approximately 80% of the evaluated cases achieving near-identical matches to ground-truth corrective actions. Overall, this study provides both theoretical and empirical evidence to prove that domain-adaptive fine-tuning can align model output distributions more closely with real-world operational data, demonstrating its promise as a reliable and governable building block for insurance applications.

*Ahmed Rafid,Rumman Adib,Fariya Ahmed,Ajwad Abrar,Mohammed Saidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BanglaSummEval, a reference-free, question-answering-based system to evaluate factual consistency in Bangla text summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of reliable evaluation metrics for Bangla summarization, a widely spoken but under-resourced language, especially in critical domains such as healthcare and news.

Method: The method uses an end-to-end multilingual instruction-tuned language model to generate and compare questions and answers for factual consistency, enhanced by BERTScore-Recall for semantic accuracy.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated strong correlation with human expert judgments on 300 human-written summaries across educational and medical domains (Pearson's $r=0.694$, Spearman's $ρ=0.763$).

Conclusion: BanglaSummEval provides a reliable and interpretable framework for evaluating factual consistency in Bangla summaries and contributes to low-resource language processing.

Abstract: Evaluating factual consistency is essential for reliable text summarization, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and news. However, most existing evaluation metrics overlook Bangla, a widely spoken yet under-resourced language, and often depend on reference summaries. We introduce BanglaSummEval, a reference-free, question-answering-based framework for evaluating factual consistency in Bangla summarization. The proposed method assesses both factual accuracy and content coverage through automatically generated questions and answers derived from the source document and the summary. A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $ρ= 0.763$). By providing interpretable, step-wise diagnostics alongside reliable evaluation scores, BanglaSummEval offers a practical and transparent solution for factual consistency evaluation in low-resource language settings.

*Minh Duc Bui,Manuel Mager,Peter Herbert Kann,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the potential of NLP for Meenzerisch, a German dialect, by developing a digital dictionary and testing large language models, finding their current performance inadequate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the declining use of Meenzerisch, the German dialect of Mainz, and investigate how NLP tools can aid its preservation and revival amidst broader efforts for endangered languages and dialects.

Method: The authors introduce a digital dictionary with 2,351 Meenzerisch words and definitions in Standard German. They experiment with large language models to assess their ability to define dialect words and generate dialect words from definitions, including additional techniques like few-shot learning and rule-based approaches.

Result: The tested language models proved ineffective, achieving only 6.27% accuracy for definitions and 1.51% for word generation. Even enhancement strategies failed to achieve accuracy above 10%.

Conclusion: NLP technology is far from ready to support Meenzerisch preservation. Urgent further research and resources are required to address this gap for German dialects and endangered languages generally.

Abstract: Meenzerisch, the dialect spoken in the German city of Mainz, is also the traditional language of the Mainz carnival, a yearly celebration well known throughout Germany. However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed.

*Ofer Meshi,Krisztian Balog,Sally Goldman,Avi Caciularu,Guy Tennenholtz,Jihwan Jeong,Amir Globerson,Craig Boutilier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConvApparel, a dataset addressing the realism gap in LLM-based user simulators, with a validation framework showing that data-driven simulators perform better in counterfactual evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the realism gap in conversational AI, where systems optimized on simulated data perform poorly in real-world applications.

Method: The study creates ConvApparel, a dual-agent conversational dataset with "good" and "bad" recommenders, first-person user annotations, and a validation framework incorporating statistical alignment, human-likeness scores, and counterfactual validation.

Result: Finds a significant realism gap across tested simulators, but data-driven models outperform prompted baselines, particularly in adapting to new behaviors.

Conclusion: Data-driven simulators better approximate realistic user behavior, making them more effective for improving conversational AI, despite remaining imperfections.

Abstract: The promise of LLM-based user simulators to improve conversational AI is hindered by a critical "realism gap," leading to systems that are optimized for simulated interactions, but may fail to perform well in the real world. We introduce ConvApparel, a new dataset of human-AI conversations designed to address this gap. Its unique dual-agent data collection protocol -- using both "good" and "bad" recommenders -- enables counterfactual validation by capturing a wide spectrum of user experiences, enriched with first-person annotations of user satisfaction. We propose a comprehensive validation framework that combines statistical alignment, a human-likeness score, and counterfactual validation to test for generalization. Our experiments reveal a significant realism gap across all simulators. However, the framework also shows that data-driven simulators outperform a prompted baseline, particularly in counterfactual validation where they adapt more realistically to unseen behaviors, suggesting they embody more robust, if imperfect, user models.

*Hasan Can Biyik,Libby Barak,Jing Peng,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-lingual transfer challenges in multilingual euphemism detection, particularly focusing on English-Turkish pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the challenges of multilingual euphemism detection highlights how cultural and pragmatic contexts affect AI language translation and transfer.

Method: The study categorizes Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) into Overlapping and Non-Overlapping subsets, analyzing their semantic and pragmatic alignment for cross-lingual performance in Turkish and English.

Result: Finds a transfer asymmetry where semantic overlap does not guarantee successful transfer, with low-resource Turkish-to-English often deteriorating performance.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural and label-based differences significantly impact multilingual euphemism modeling, with domain-specific factors playing a potential role in transfer dynamics.

Abstract: Euphemisms substitute socially sensitive expressions, often softening or reframing meaning, and their reliance on cultural and pragmatic context complicates modeling across languages. In this study, we investigate how cross-lingual equivalence influences transfer in multilingual euphemism detection. We categorize Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English into Overlapping (OPETs) and Non-Overlapping (NOPETs) subsets based on their functional, pragmatic, and semantic alignment. Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training. Differences in label distribution help explain these counterintuitive results. Category-level analysis suggests that transfer may be influenced by domain-specific alignment, though evidence is limited by sparsity.

*Kourosh Shahnazari,Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh,Mohammadali Keshtparvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an uncertainty-aware computational framework for analyzing Classical Persian poetry, associating verses with psychological concepts and ensuring interpretive caution through uncertainty propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome challenges in large-scale, reproducible analysis of Classical Persian poetry that is rich in metaphor, intertextual convention, and rhetorical complexity, making close reading indispensable.

Method: The framework uses multi-label automatic annotation to associate verses with psychological concepts, confidence scores, and an abstention flag. The analysis includes confidence-weighted aggregation, divergence measures, a co-occurrence graph, and Eigenmood embedding for interpretation.

Result: On a corpus of 61,573 verses from 10 poets, 22.2% of verses were marked with insufficient evidence for analysis, highlighting the significance of uncertainty. Methodological insights such as sensitivity analysis and selection-bias diagnostics were conducted.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable and auditable psychological analysis of poetry while maintaining interpretive caution by incorporating uncertainty into the analysis process.

Abstract: Classical Persian poetry is a historically sustained archive in which affective life is expressed through metaphor, intertextual convention, and rhetorical indirection. These properties make close reading indispensable while limiting reproducible comparison at scale. We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes. The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference.

*Serin Kim,Sangam Lee,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Persona2Web, a benchmark designed to evaluate how well personalized web agents handle ambiguous queries using user history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents lack adequate personalization capabilities, making it crucial to develop systems that can infer user preferences and contexts from ambiguous queries without relying solely on explicit instructions.

Method: Persona2Web is developed as a multi-component benchmark featuring user histories, ambiguous queries, and a reasoning-aware evaluation framework. Experiments were conducted extensively to test various components and their performance.

Result: Experiments highlight significant challenges and gaps in current personalized web agent systems, especially when handling varying query ambiguity and incorporating user history.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a foundational framework for developing more effective personalized web agents, with reproducible datasets and codes to advance future research in this field.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced web agents, yet current agents lack personalization capabilities. Since users rarely specify every detail of their intent, practical web agents must be able to interpret ambiguous queries by inferring user preferences and contexts. To address this challenge, we present Persona2Web, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized web agents on the real open web, built upon the clarify-to-personalize principle, which requires agents to resolve ambiguity based on user history rather than relying on explicit instructions. Persona2Web consists of: (1) user histories that reveal preferences implicitly over long time spans, (2) ambiguous queries that require agents to infer implicit user preferences, and (3) a reasoning-aware evaluation framework that enables fine-grained assessment of personalization. We conduct extensive experiments across various agent architectures, backbone models, history access schemes, and queries with varying ambiguity levels, revealing key challenges in personalized web agent behavior. For reproducibility, our codes and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Persona2Web-73E8.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time method for error recovery in LLM-powered conversational agents, improving resilience without fine-tuning or prompt modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in conversational agents due to user-induced errors and explore error recovery methods without costly model fine-tuning or prompt modification.

Method: The proposed Reasoning Inception (ReIn) uses an external module to identify dialogue errors, generate recovery plans, and integrate them into the agent's decision-making process during test-time, without altering the model's architecture.

Result: ReIn improves task success, handles unseen error types, and outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches across various agent models and error scenarios.

Conclusion: Reasoning Inception provides an efficient and adaptable strategy for enhancing the resilience of conversational agents, avoiding modifications to backbone models or system prompts.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with tool integration achieve strong performance on fixed task-oriented dialogue datasets but remain vulnerable to unanticipated, user-induced errors. Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts.

*Jared Moore,Rasmus Overmark,Ned Cooper,Beba Cibralic,Nick Haber,Cameron R. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates theory of mind (ToM) in humans and LLMs through a persuasion task, revealing differences in their ability to infer and act upon mental states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in theory of mind evaluation by introducing an interactive persuasion task to assess sensitivity to knowledge and motivational states.

Method: Participants engaged in a novel persuasion task with varied conditions (Revealed or Hidden states). Experiments assessed interaction with both bots and humans.

Result: LLMs performed well in Revealed conditions but struggled in Hidden ones, whereas humans were moderately successful in both. LLMs excelled in human-targeted persuasion across all conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs show persuasive capabilities without explicit ToM, emphasizing caution in attributing human-like ToM abilities to them while noting their influence potential.

Abstract: A growing body of work attempts to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) abilities of humans and large language models (LLMs) using static, non-interactive question-and-answer benchmarks. However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior.

*Deepak Uniyal,Md Abul Bashar,Richi Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four methods for cross-lingual text classification to analyze multilingual social media discourse in the context of hydrogen energy debates using a dataset of over 9 million tweets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on addressing the difficulty of analyzing multilingual social media discourse during global debates spanning diverse languages, using hydrogen energy discussions as a case study.

Method: Four cross-lingual approaches are explored: (1) language-specific models using translated English annotations, (2) a single English-based model with translated unlabeled data, (3) multilingual transformer models applied to target languages, and (4) a hybrid strategy combining translated annotations with multilingual training. These models are evaluated for filtering relevant tweets and topic modeling to identify themes.

Result: The evaluation highlights trade-offs in translation-based and multilingual approaches, providing insights into how each method performs in filtering hydrogen-related tweets and extracting dominant themes from the data.

Conclusion: The results offer actionable insights for optimizing cross-lingual pipelines in large-scale multilingual social media analysis, demonstrating strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in effectively analyzing global conversations.

Abstract: Analysing multilingual social media discourse remains a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly when large-scale public debates span across diverse languages. This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis.

TL;DR: ALPS is an expert-curated linguistic diagnostic set for assessing deep Arabic language understanding, testing 23 NLP models and finding major gaps in morpho-syntactic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of synthetic or translated data in prevalent Arabic NLP benchmarks and create a resource focused on in-depth linguistic and pragmatic examination.

Method: Developed ALPS, a 531-question, expert-curated diagnostic dataset targeting 15 tasks and 47 subtasks. Arabic linguistic expertise was utilized to ensure cultural and linguistic authenticity.

Result: Evaluation of 23 models showed significant challenges in morpho-syntactic tasks. Top-performing models still fell short of human expert performance.

Conclusion: ALPS highlights the need for improvements in Arabic-specific NLP models and provides a robust diagnostic tool for linguistic capabilities.

Abstract: While recent Arabic NLP benchmarks focus on scale, they often rely on synthetic or translated data which may benefit from deeper linguistic verification. We introduce ALPS (Arabic Linguistic & Pragmatic Suite), a native, expert-curated diagnostic challenge set probing Deep Semantics and Pragmatics, capabilities that complement specialized large-scale benchmarks. While broad-coverage benchmarks prioritize scale and multi-task coverage, ALPS targets the depth of linguistic understanding through 531 rigorously crafted questions across 15 tasks and 47 subtasks. We developed the dataset with deep expertise in Arabic linguistics, guaranteeing cultural authenticity and eliminating translation artifacts. Evaluating 23 diverse models (commercial, open-source, and Arabic-native) against a single-pass human performance (avg. 84.6% accuracy) and an expert-adjudicated oracle (99.2%), we reveal a critical dissociation: models achieve high fluency but fail on fundamental morpho-syntactic dependencies, with elevated error rates on morpho-syntactic dependencies (36.5% across diacritics-reliant tasks) compared to compositional semantics. While top commercial models (Gemini-3-flash at 94.2%) surpass the average single human, a substantial gap persists between commercial giants and Arabic-native models, with the best Arabic-specific model (Jais-2-70B at 83.6%) approaching but not matching human performance.

### [87] [BankMathBench: A Benchmark for Numerical Reasoning in Banking Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17072)
*Yunseung Lee,Subin Kim,Youngjun Kwak,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BankMathBench, a dataset addressing limitations of LLMs in performing banking-specific numerical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with core banking computations, such as interest and payout calculations, due to their inability to perform multi-step numerical reasoning and context-based understanding. Existing benchmarks inadequately assess these everyday banking tasks.

Method: The authors propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset representing realistic banking scenarios. The dataset is structured into three difficulty levels to test various reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Result: BankMathBench-trained LLMs significantly improved in formula generation and numerical reasoning, achieving accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced) compared to zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: BankMathBench is an effective benchmark for evaluating and advancing LLMs' abilities in complex, real-world banking tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based chatbots are increasingly being adopted in the financial domain, particularly in digital banking, to handle customer inquiries about products such as deposits, savings, and loans. However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines. These findings highlight BankMathBench as a reliable benchmark for evaluating and advancing LLMs' numerical reasoning in real-world banking scenarios.

### [88] [Projective Psychological Assessment of Large Multimodal Models Using Thematic Apperception Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17108)
*Anton Dzega,Aviad Elyashar,Ortal Slobodin,Odeya Cohen,Rami Puzis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LMMs can be assessed using a psychological framework (TAT) and a scoring methodology (SCORS-G) for evaluating personality traits in non-language modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LMMs can exhibit traits typically associated with human personality and to assess their abilities to interpret and analyze interpersonal dynamics.

Method: LMMs served as both subject models (SMs) generating stories based on TAT images and evaluator models (EMs) assessing these stories within the SCORS-G framework.

Result: Evaluator models showed a high degree of understanding, aligning their interpretations closely with human experts. Larger and newer LMMs consistently outperformed smaller, older models across various SCORS-G dimensions, though they struggled with aggression-related aspects.

Conclusion: The study reveals that while LMMs exhibit strong interpersonal and self-concept understanding, there are limitations in their ability to manage aggression. Model performance improves with size and recency of development.

Abstract: Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is a psychometrically grounded, multidimensional assessment framework that systematically differentiates between cognitive-representational and affective-relational components of personality-like functioning. This test is a projective psychological framework designed to uncover unconscious aspects of personality. This study examines whether the personality traits of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can be assessed through non-language-based modalities, using the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale - Global (SCORS-G). LMMs are employed in two distinct roles: as subject models (SMs), which generate stories in response to TAT images, and as evaluator models (EMs), who assess these narratives using the SCORS-G framework. Evaluators demonstrated an excellent ability to understand and analyze TAT responses. Their interpretations are highly consistent with those of human experts. Assessment results highlight that all models understand interpersonal dynamics very well and have a good grasp of the concept of self. However, they consistently fail to perceive and regulate aggression. Performance varied systematically across model families, with larger and more recent models consistently outperforming smaller and earlier ones across SCORS-G dimensions.

### [89] [The Emergence of Lab-Driven Alignment Signatures: A Psychometric Framework for Auditing Latent Bias and Compounding Risk in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17127)
*Dusan Bosnjakovic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an auditing framework for LLMs to detect stable latent biases embedded during training, aiming to ensure safe, unbiased multi-agent system designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need for reliable techniques to uncover stable behavioral biases (latent tendencies) in LLMs to ensure their safe and fair deployment in multi-agent systems and critical applications.

Method: The methodology employs psychometric measurement theory using forced-choice ordinal vignettes with cryptographic permutation invariance, alongside statistical analyses like Mixed Linear Models and ICC.

Result: The study revealed stable lab-specific behavioral clustering in LLMs, demonstrating that biases are embedded and can propagate in multi-layered systems.

Conclusion: Latent biases in LLMs can evolve into ideological reinforcement within interconnected systems, necessitating robust auditing to prevent recursive echo chambers.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from standalone chat interfaces to foundational reasoning layers in multi-agent systems and recursive evaluation loops (LLM-as-a-judge), the detection of durable, provider-level behavioral signatures becomes a critical requirement for safety and governance. Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions.
  This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.
  Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures.

*Adrian Cosma,Cosmin Dumitrache,Emilian Radoi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies patient satisfaction in Romanian text-based telemedicine by analyzing 77,334 consultation exchanges and identifying features influencing feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how patient ratings and satisfaction signals are influenced by communication characteristics in text-based telemedicine, where clinicians are evaluated mostly on patient communication quality rather than clinical accuracy.

Method: A binary classification model was trained on 77,334 anonymized doctor-patient text interactions. The study explored language-agnostic features and psycholinguistic markers, employing SHAP-based analyses and subgroup correlations.

Result: Patient and clinician history were dominant predictors of feedback. Politeness and hedging markers positively correlated with feedback, while lexical diversity showed a negative association.

Conclusion: Improving patient satisfaction in text-based telemedicine requires attention to communication styles, particularly politeness and hedging, more than clinical accuracy.

Abstract: Text-based telemedicine has become a common mode of care, requiring clinicians to deliver medical advice clearly and effectively in writing. As platforms increasingly rely on patient ratings and feedback, clinicians face growing pressure to maintain satisfaction scores, even though these evaluations often reflect communication quality more than clinical accuracy. We analyse patient satisfaction signals in Romanian text-based telemedicine. Using a sample of 77,334 anonymised patient question--doctor response pairs, we model feedback as a binary outcome, treating thumbs-up responses as positive and grouping negative or absent feedback into the other class. We extract interpretable, predominantly language-agnostic features (e.g., length, structural characteristics, readability proxies), along with Romanian LIWC psycholinguistic features and politeness/hedging markers where available. We train a classifier with a time-based split and perform SHAP-based analyses, which indicate that patient and clinician history features dominate prediction, functioning as strong priors, while characteristics of the response text provide a smaller but, crucially, actionable signal. In subgroup correlation analyses, politeness and hedging are consistently positively associated with patient feedback, whereas lexical diversity shows a negative association.

### [91] [Quantifying and Mitigating Socially Desirable Responding in LLMs: A Desirability-Matched Graded Forced-Choice Psychometric Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17262)
*Kensuke Okada,Yui Furukawa,Kyosuke Bunji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of socially desirable responding (SDR) in using self-report questionnaires to evaluate large language models (LLMs) and introduces methods to quantify and mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bias caused by LLMs tending to respond with socially desirable answers during questionnaire-based evaluations, which skews results and conclusions.

Method: A psychometric framework is introduced that calculates SDR by comparing responses under HONEST vs. FAKE-GOOD conditions using item response theory (IRT) latent scores. A graded forced-choice (GFC) inventory for Big Five traits is also developed to minimize SDR.

Result: The study finds that standard Likert-style questionnaires produce significant SDR, while the GFC format effectively reduces SDR and maintains profile recovery across nine instruction-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SDR substantially impacts questionnaire-based LLM evaluations and recommends adopting SDR-aware practices and tools, such as GFC, to improve evaluation reliability.

Abstract: Human self-report questionnaires are increasingly used in NLP to benchmark and audit large language models (LLMs), from persona consistency to safety and bias assessments. Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.

*Yukun Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Jialong Tang,Yu Wan,Baosong Yang,Yiming Li,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents X-Value, a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on assessing content values cross-linguistically, highlighting current deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus in current evaluation paradigms on detecting subtle value dimensions in digital content, particularly from a global perspective.

Method: The authors developed X-Value, consisting of over 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values. They also introduced a two-stage annotation framework for systematic evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate poor accuracy (less than 77%) on cross-lingual values assessment, with disparities exceeding 20% across languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are insufficient for nuanced, values-aware content assessment; further improvements are necessary, and X-Value is presented to aid this development.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal to content safety, current evaluation paradigms primarily focus on detecting explicit harms (e.g., violence or hate speech), neglecting the subtler value dimensions conveyed in digital content. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Value, a novel Cross-lingual Values Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess deep-level values of content from a global perspective. X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($ΔAcc > 20\%$). This work highlights the urgent need to improve the nuanced, values-aware content assessment capability of LLMs. Our X-Value is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Whitolf/X-Value.

*Evgeniia Tokarchuk,Maya K. Nachesa,Sergey Troshin,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates representation collapse in Transformer-based neural machine translation and introduces a regularization technique to combat it, improving translation quality and quantization outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of representation collapse in modern Transformer-based neural translation models, especially during the end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation systems.

Method: The authors analyze representation collapse dynamics in discrete and continuous Transformers and adopt an angular dispersion-based regularization method to rectify it.

Result: The proposed regularization not only reduces representation collapse but also enhances translation quality. Additionally, its benefits extend to quantized models, preserving model performance even after quantization.

Conclusion: Angular dispersion-based regularization effectively mitigates representation collapse in both continuous and quantized neural machine translation models, leading to overall performance improvements.

Abstract: Modern neural translation models based on the Transformer architecture are known for their high performance, particularly when trained on high-resource datasets. A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization.

*Bogdan Kostić,Conor Fallon,Julian Risch,Alexander Löser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper assesses the reliability of benchmarks for LLM evaluation under controlled linguistic perturbations, revealing substantial vulnerability to surface-level changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks are crucial for comparing LLMs, but their reliability is questionable due to sensitivity to minor input changes.

Method: The study applies linguistically principled pipelines for synonym substitution and dependency-based syntactic transformations to analyze 23 LLMs across three benchmarks.

Result: Lexical perturbations lead to significant performance drops, while syntactic variations show mixed impacts, destabilizing model rankings across tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs rely heavily on lexical patterns rather than deep linguistic understanding, advocating for robustness testing in evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established standardized evaluation benchmarks as the primary instrument for model comparison. Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.

*Yiming Zhang,Siyue Zhang,Junbo Zhao,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge faced by large language models in long-tail question answering by introducing RPDR, a data augmentation framework that outperforms existing retrievers on niche knowledge retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve retrieval systems' performance for less common and niche knowledge in long-tail question answering, addressing the generalization issues of dense retrievers.

Method: The authors propose RPDR, a framework involving synthetic data generation, filtering datasets via Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and training dense retrievers using these selected datasets.

Result: RPDR demonstrates significant performance improvements over conventional baselines like BM25 and Contriver on long-tail retrieval benchmarks (PopQA and EntityQuestion), particularly excelling in extremely rare categories.

Conclusion: RPDR enhances long-tail retrieval by utilizing targeted data augmentation techniques and proposes dynamic query routing mechanisms for future retrieval improvement.

Abstract: Long-tail question answering presents significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to their limited ability to acquire and accurately recall less common knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in mitigating this limitation by integrating external retrieval mechanisms. However, dense retrieval models often face the same difficulties when generalizing to rare or niche knowledge. In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance.

*Leonidas Zotos,Hedderik van Rijn,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Students can use cognitive availability, operationalized by the prevalence of options in large datasets, to answer multiple-choice questions effectively. Choosing the most mentally available option improves performance versus random guessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the cognitive availability heuristic can serve as a strategy for guessing answers in multiple-choice questions when test-takers are unsure.

Method: A computational method was developed to assess the cognitive availability of MCQ options using their prevalence in large corpora, with Wikipedia serving as the corpus for analysis.

Result: Correct MCQ answers are significantly more available than incorrect options. Using availability as a guessing strategy results in 13.5% to 32.9% better scores than random guessing, and patterns hold for both expert-created and LLM-generated options.

Conclusion: Availability is a valid mental heuristic for answering MCQs and should be considered when modeling student behavior. Computational methods can enhance understanding of cognitive processes in learning environments.

Abstract: When students are unsure of the correct answer to a multiple-choice question (MCQ), guessing is common practice. The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour.

TL;DR: The paper revises an annotation scheme for CDCR to enhance analysis of diverse and polarized news discourse, focusing on both identity and near-identity relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CDCR datasets are limited as they narrowly define coreference, which isn't effective for analyzing diverse, polarized news coverage.

Method: The authors propose modifying CDCR annotation in the NewsWCL50 dataset to include broader identity relations and reannotate related datasets using a unified framework.

Result: The reannotated datasets show improved balance and alignment, enabling better discourse-aware CDCR research.

Conclusion: This revised annotation scheme improves the ability of CDCR models to capture lexical diversity and framing variations in polarized news environments.

Abstract: Cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) identifies and links mentions of the same entities and events across related documents, enabling content analysis that aggregates information at the level of discourse participants. However, existing datasets primarily focus on event resolution and employ a narrow definition of coreference, which limits their effectiveness in analyzing diverse and polarized news coverage where wording varies widely. This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking "the caravan" - "asylum seekers" - "those contemplating illegal entry", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates BLEU and ChrF++ metrics for machine translation in extremely low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating machine translation quality in extremely low-resource language scenarios where common metrics like BLEU often fail.

Method: A comparative analysis of BLEU and ChrF++ metrics, while testing on three extremely low-resource languages: Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi. The analysis focuses on translation artifacts like hallucinations and repetitions.

Result: Findings show that BLEU, despite lower absolute scores, complements ChrF++ by providing valuable lexical-precision insights in low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: BLEU and ChrF++ metrics together offer a more comprehensive evaluation approach for low-resource language translation quality.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in extremely low-resource language (ELRL) scenarios poses unique challenges, as widely used metrics such as BLEU, effective in high-resource settings, often misrepresent quality in data-scarce contexts. This work presents a comparative analysis of BLEU, an n-gram-based metric, and ChrF++, a character-based metric, for MT evaluation in ELRL settings. We examine how each metric responds to translation artifacts, including hallucinations, repetition, source-text copying, and diacritic (\textit{matra}) variations across three ELRLs: Magahi, Bhojpuri, and Chhattisgarhi, with a focus on outputs from large language models (LLMs) and neural MT (NMT) systems. While recent work often relies solely on ChrF++, our findings show that BLEU, despite its lower absolute scores, provides complementary lexical-precision insights that improve interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined taxonomy and framework for uncertainty quantification in long-form outputs of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods for hallucination detection in LLMs are tailored to short-form outputs and do not adapt effectively to long-form generation.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy based on three design stages—response decomposition, unit-level scoring, response-level aggregation—and extend consistency-based black-box scoring methods.

Result: The study finds that claim-response entailment performs strongly, claim-level scoring outperforms sentence-level scoring, and uncertainty-aware decoding enhances the factuality of long-form outputs.

Conclusion: The framework bridges prior methods, facilitates direct comparisons, and serves as a practical guide for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM tasks.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the strategic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a new game-theoretic framework called AIDG, highlighting their strong defense performance but weaker deduction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the dynamic strategic reasoning abilities of LLMs by moving beyond static benchmarks and exploring multi-turn interactions.

Method: The authors introduce AIDG, a framework with two tasks (AIDG-I for pragmatic strategy and AIDG-II for constraint satisfaction), to evaluate LLMs through adversarial games involving deduction and containment.

Result: LLMs show an asymmetry in abilities, performing significantly better at containment (350 ELO advantage, Cohen's d = 5.47) than at active deduction, with notable bottlenecks in Information Dynamics and Constraint Adherence.

Conclusion: LLMs are proficient in local defensive coherence but struggle with global state tracking, suggesting limitations in strategic reasoning for inquiry tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating the strategic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires moving beyond static benchmarks to dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured "20 Questions" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry.

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in LLMs' responses to MCQs and proposes a bias-reduced evaluation method to improve robustness by using uniform, unordered labels, demonstrating significant variance reduction with negligible performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by biases observed in large language models (LLMs) when responding to multiple-choice questions, where these biases can affect fairness and robustness in performance evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce an evaluation protocol that replaces specific labels in MCQs with uniform, unordered alternatives and uses a sentence similarity model to analyze LLM responses under reduced artifacts.

Result: The proposed method reduces mean accuracy variance by threefold while maintaining comparable performance of LLMs, demonstrating improved consistency across answer permutations.

Conclusion: The bias-reduced protocol proves effective in revealing LLMs' true capabilities with fewer artifacts, increasing evaluation fairness and reliability across benchmarks and models.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have been a standard evaluation practice for measuring LLMs' ability to reason and answer knowledge-based questions. Through a synthetic NonsenseQA benchmark, we observe that different LLMs exhibit varying degrees of label-position-few-shot-prompt bias, where the model either uses the answer position, the label in front of the answer, the distributions of correct answers present in the few-shot prompt, or a combination of all to answer each MCQ question. We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones.

TL;DR: The study introduces an Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework, which optimizes data selection for fine-tuning language models while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome resource limitations in fine-tuning language models by improving data selection efficiency, especially under compute-constrained scenarios.

Method: The study uses entropy-based unsupervised data selection to filter and optimize training data for different NLP tasks, minimizing data requirements and computational demands.

Result: Experiments on sentiment analysis, topic classification, and question answering tasks validated EUDS as effective, reducing computational costs and improving training efficiency.

Conclusion: The EUDS framework provides an innovative solution for fine-tuning language models with less training data, addressing both computational resource constraints and data usability challenges effectively.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) increasingly require two critical resources: computational resources and data resources. Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement. This provides an innovative solution for the efficient fine-tuning of LMs in the compute-constrained scenarios.

*Greta Damo,Stéphane Petiot,Elena Cabrio,Serena Villata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEACE 2.0 is a novel tool to analyze hate speech, explain its nature, and generate evidence-based counter-speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the growing societal problem of hate speech on online platforms and the need for effective counter-speech responses.

Method: The tool employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ground hate speech explanations in evidence, generate counter-speech, and analyze counter-speech characteristics.

Result: PEACE 2.0 successfully integrates hate speech analysis and evidence-based counter-speech generation, covering both explicit and implicit hateful messages.

Conclusion: By using PEACE 2.0, researchers or other users can deeply analyze and effectively respond to hateful content online, advancing tools for mitigating hate speech effects.

Abstract: The increasing volume of hate speech on online platforms poses significant societal challenges. While the Natural Language Processing community has developed effective methods to automatically detect the presence of hate speech, responses to it, called counter-speech, are still an open challenge. We present PEACE 2.0, a novel tool that, besides analysing and explaining why a message is considered hateful or not, also generates a response to it. More specifically, PEACE 2.0 has three main new functionalities: leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline i) to ground HS explanations into evidence and facts, ii) to automatically generate evidence-grounded counter-speech, and iii) exploring the characteristics of counter-speech replies. By integrating these capabilities, PEACE 2.0 enables in-depth analysis and response generation for both explicit and implicit hateful messages.

*Nusrat Jahan Lia,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Cross-Lingual Sentiment Misalignment between Bengali and English using four transformer architectures and uncovers significant failures in sentiment interpretation and trust-building mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of AI alignment across language barriers, focusing on sentiment understanding and preserving human intent and trust in multilingual contexts.

Method: The study benchmarks four transformer models, assesses their sentiment alignment effectiveness, and investigates systemic factors like empathy and bias affecting AI-human trust.

Result: Compressed model (mDistilBERT) shows a 28.7% Sentiment Inversion Rate, while IndicBERT exhibits bias towards formal Bengali, increasing alignment errors. The paper highlights empathy asymmetry and modern bias issues.

Conclusion: Culturally grounded pluralistic alignment is essential for AI systems, emphasizing the need for Affective Stability metrics to maintain emotional fidelity across languages and dialects.

Abstract: The core theme of bidirectional alignment is ensuring that AI systems accurately understand human intent and that humans can trust AI behavior. However, this loop fractures significantly across language barriers. Our research addresses Cross-Lingual Sentiment Misalignment between Bengali and English by benchmarking four transformer architectures. We reveal severe safety and representational failures in current alignment paradigms. We demonstrate that compressed model (mDistilBERT) exhibits 28.7% "Sentiment Inversion Rate," fundamentally misinterpreting positive user intent as negative (or vice versa). Furthermore, we identify systemic nuances affecting human-AI trust, including "Asymmetric Empathy" where some models systematically dampen and others amplify the affective weight of Bengali text relative to its English counterpart. Finally, we reveal a "Modern Bias" in the regional model (IndicBERT), which shows a 57% increase in alignment error when processing formal (Sadhu) Bengali. We argue that equitable human-AI co-evolution requires pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment that respects language and dialectal diversity over universal compression, which fails to preserve the emotional fidelity required for reciprocal human-AI trust. We recommend that alignment benchmarks incorporate "Affective Stability" metrics that explicitly penalize polarity inversions in low-resource and dialectal contexts.

*Pietro Ferrazzi,Mattia Franzin,Alberto Lavelli,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates whether smaller LLMs (around 1B parameters) can effectively perform medical NLP tasks. Fine-tuning is the most effective adaptation strategy, and smaller models outperform larger counterparts in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of large LLMs and investigate whether smaller models can provide comparable performance in medical NLP tasks.

Method: The study evaluated LLMs (Llama-3, Gemma-3, Qwen3) on 20 clinical NLP tasks across various strategies including few-shot prompting, constraint decoding, fine-tuning, and continual pretraining.

Result: Small LLMs demonstrated strong performance, with the best model (Qwen3-1.7B) surpassing a much larger model (Qwen3-32B) by +9.2 points.

Conclusion: Small LLMs, when fine-tuned or strategically adapted, can match or surpass the performance of significantly larger models, making them feasible for medical NLP tasks in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently excel in diverse medical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial computational requirements often limit deployment in real-world healthcare settings. In this work, we investigate whether "small" LLMs (around one billion parameters) can effectively perform medical tasks while maintaining competitive accuracy. We evaluate models from three major families-Llama-3, Gemma-3, and Qwen3-across 20 clinical NLP tasks among Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Case Report Form Filling, Question Answering, and Argument Mining. We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives. Our results show that small LLMs can match or even surpass larger baselines, with our best configuration based on Qwen3-1.7B achieving an average score +9.2 points higher than Qwen3-32B. We release a comprehensive collection of all the publicly available Italian medical datasets for NLP tasks, together with our top-performing models. Furthermore, we release an Italian dataset of 126M words from the Emergency Department of an Italian Hospital, and 175M words from various sources that we used for continual pre-training.

*Baris Karacan,Barbara Di Eugenio,Patrick Thornton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces advancements in clinical section segmentation through a new dataset, systematic evaluation of transformer models, and comparison with zero-shot large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical free-text notes hold essential patient information, and recognizing labelled sections within these notes can enhance clinical decision-making and support NLP tasks.

Method: The study curates a new obstetrics notes dataset, evaluates transformer-based supervised models in-domain and out-of-domain, and compares them with zero-shot large language models.

Result: Supervised models perform well in-domain but struggle out-of-domain, whereas zero-shot models exhibit robust adaptability with corrected hallucinated section headers.

Conclusion: Domain-specific clinical resources are crucial for accurate segmentation, and zero-shot models present a promising approach for diverse healthcare NLP applications if hallucination issues are managed.

Abstract: Clinical free-text notes contain vital patient information. They are structured into labelled sections; recognizing these sections has been shown to support clinical decision-making and downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed.

### [107] [Using LLMs for Knowledge Component-level Correctness Labeling in Open-ended Coding Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17542)
*Zhangqi Duan,Arnav Kankaria,Dhruv Kartik,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-based framework to directly label fine-grained knowledge components (KCs) in student code to enhance student modeling, demonstrating improved learning curve fitting and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately labeling KC-level correctness is crucial for understanding student mastery, yet real-world programming datasets lack such granular annotations, complicating analysis.

Method: An automated framework uses large language models (LLMs) to tag KC correctness in programming code. It employs a temporal Code-KC mapping to align labels with student code dynamics.

Result: The proposed framework yields learning curves better aligned with cognitive theory and enhances predictive performance over baselines, with human evaluations confirming significant agreement with expert annotations.

Conclusion: The LLM-based approach enables precise KC-level correctness evaluation, advancing student modeling and learning analytics.

Abstract: Fine-grained skill representations, commonly referred to as knowledge components (KCs), are fundamental to many approaches in student modeling and learning analytics. However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.

### [108] [Learning to Stay Safe: Adaptive Regularization Against Safety Degradation during Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546)
*Jyotin Goel,Souvik Maji,Pratik Mazumder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study presents a training framework for fine-tuning language models while maintaining safety, using adaptive regularization and risk estimation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue where instruction-following language models lose safety under benign and adversarial fine-tuning, and to provide an approach that avoids the trade-off between safety and utility.

Method: The method involves adaptive regularization informed by safety risk estimation. Two approaches are explored: a judge-based Safety Critic using harm scores and an activation-based risk predictor leveraging model activations. Risk signals constrain high-risk updates, keeping them aligned with a safe reference policy.

Result: The framework consistently lowers attack success rates, preserves downstream task performance, and incurs no inference-time cost across various models and attack scenarios.

Conclusion: Adaptive regularization informed by safety-based risk estimation is effective in maintaining the safety alignment of language models without compromising their utility.

Abstract: Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task of modeling human intervention in collaborative web task execution and presents an intervention-aware system that improves agent adaptability and usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a principled understanding of when and why humans intervene in autonomous web agents' decision-making, which frequently leads to errors or inefficiencies.

Method: The authors collected CowCorpus, a dataset containing 400 real-user web navigation trajectories. They identified four user-agent interaction patterns and trained language models (LMs) to predict human intervention based on these patterns. They deployed these models in live web agents and conducted a user study.

Result: The intervention-aware models improved intervention prediction accuracy by 61.4-63.4% over base LMs. Moreover, the live deployment led to a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness.

Conclusion: Structured modeling of human intervention enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of collaborative web agents, enabling them to better align with user needs.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous web agents, human involvement remains essential for shaping preferences and correcting agent behavior as tasks unfold. However, current agentic systems lack a principled understanding of when and why humans intervene, often proceeding autonomously past critical decision points or requesting unnecessary confirmation. In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents.

### [110] [The Cascade Equivalence Hypothesis: When Do Speech LLMs Behave Like ASR$\rightarrow$LLM Pipelines?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17598)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates four speech LLMs, analyzing their similarity to Whisper-to-LLM cascades and demonstrating that most existing models implicitly perform ASR, with some distinctions under unique architectures and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether speech-language models (speech LLMs) implicitly operate as automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and assess their efficiency and deviations from simpler cascade systems in varied contexts.

Method: The authors conducted matched-backbone testing on four speech LLMs across six tasks, utilized logit lens analysis on hidden states, and employed LEACE concept erasure to verify if text representations are causally necessary. They compared performance under clean and noisy audio conditions.

Result: Most speech LLMs were statistically similar to Whisper-to-LLM cascades, especially Ultravox, which showed indistinguishable results. However, Qwen2-Audio deviated significantly, demonstrating architecture-specific divergence. Performance severely degraded under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Current speech LLMs are computationally expensive and often equivalent to cascaded systems, with significant limitations under noisy conditions. The findings emphasize the need for architecture-specific development to address these issues.

Abstract: Current speech LLMs largely perform implicit ASR: on tasks solvable from a transcript, they are behaviorally and mechanistically equivalent to simple Whisper$\to$LLM cascades. We show this through matched-backbone testing across four speech LLMs and six tasks, controlling for the LLM backbone for the first time. Ultravox is statistically indistinguishable from its matched cascade ($κ{=}0.93$); logit lens reveals literal text emerging in hidden states; LEACE concept erasure confirms text representations are causally necessary in both architectures tested, collapsing accuracy to near-zero. Qwen2-Audio genuinely diverges, revealing cascade equivalence is architecture-dependent, not universal. For most deployed use cases, current speech LLMs are expensive cascades, and under noise, they are worse ones, with clean-condition advantages reversing by up to 7.6% at 0 dB.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DivanBench, a Persian benchmark to assess language models on superstitions and customs. Major performance gaps and biases in Persian LLMs are revealed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Persian NLP benchmarks, which fail to differentiate between memorized cultural facts and reasoning about implicit social norms.

Method: The authors designed a diagnostic benchmark, DivanBench, with 315 questions and three task types to evaluate Persian language models on cultural reasoning.

Result: Persian LLMs exhibit acquiescence bias, struggle with reasoning in cultural contexts, and show a 21% performance gap between factual retrieval and situational application.

Conclusion: Current Persian language models do not fully internalize cultural reasoning despite training on monolingual data, underlining the need for better approaches.

Abstract: While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.

*Iskar Deng,Nathalia Xu,Shane Steinert-Threlkeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of GPT-2 models trained on synthetic corpora to emulate human-like typological preferences in differential argument marking (DAM) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether language models, like GPT-2, can mimic human language typological tendencies in differential argument marking, a feature where morphological marking is influenced by semantic prominence.

Method: Controlled experiments training GPT-2 models on 18 synthetically generated corpora representing different DAM systems, followed by evaluation using minimal pairs to assess typological generalizations.

Result: Models replicate human-like tendencies for markedness direction but fail to reproduce the strong object preference human languages typically exhibit in DAM systems.

Conclusion: While language models can capture some typological preferences in DAM, other tendencies may reflect distinct underlying linguistic influences, highlighting limits of model-based cross-linguistic generalization.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained on synthetic corpora can exhibit typological preferences that resemble cross-linguistic regularities in human languages, particularly for syntactic phenomena such as word order. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources.

TL;DR: UniLID is a new language identification method focusing on low-resource and closely related language settings using the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance language identification systems, especially for low-resource and closely related language scenarios, to address performance brittleness.

Method: UniLID learns language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary, treating segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon.

Result: UniLID demonstrates competitive performance against fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings, and achieves over 70% accuracy with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: UniLID offers a data-efficient, modular approach to multilingual language identification with strong results in low-resource and dialect identification contexts.

Abstract: Language Identification (LID) is an important component of many multilingual natural language processing pipelines, where it facilitates corpus curation, training data analysis, and cross-lingual evaluation of large language models. Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.

*Aidar Myrzakhan,Tianyi Li,Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pruning method for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), focusing on unstable attention sinks, to improve efficiency without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high inference cost of Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) due to iterative denoising motivates the need for more efficient model pruning.

Method: The paper introduces 'Sink-Aware Pruning,' a pruning strategy that identifies and prunes unstable attention sinks in DLMs, diverging from traditional pruning strategies in autoregressive language models which preserve stable sink tokens.

Result: Sink-Aware Pruning achieves a superior quality-efficiency trade-off compared to prior pruning methods for DLMs, without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed method adapts pruning specifically for DLMs, overcoming inefficiencies in traditional techniques and demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing computation while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\bf \texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Sink-Aware-Pruning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using Gaussian Splatting (GS) for creating a digital twin that enables efficient, precise 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better 3D damage visualization methods, as current solutions based on photogrammetry or 2D approaches are limited in handling complex infrastructure inspections.

Method: Proposes a GS-enabled digital twin method focusing on GS-based 3D reconstruction, multi-scale strategies for detail balance, and dynamic updating of damage information.

Result: Demonstrated on a synthetic post-earthquake inspection dataset, the method shows enhanced 3D damage visualization and reduced segmentation errors.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective solution for 3D damage representation in digital twins, indicating great potential for real-world civil infrastructure inspections.

Abstract: Recent advancements in civil infrastructure inspections underscore the need for precise three-dimensional (3D) damage visualization on digital twins, transcending traditional 2D image-based damage identifications. Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the UltraVQA dataset for multi-dimensional evaluation of video quality and proposes a novel method, Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), for enhancing quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond single-number video quality scores toward more multi-faceted and interpretable evaluations of User-Generated Content (UGC).

Method: The authors developed the UltraVQA dataset annotated with multi-dimensional quality features, and proposed Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a post-training objective for improving video quality assessments through a regularized decision-making framework.

Result: The proposed ASO method outperformed baselines (both open-source and closed-source) and reduced mean absolute error (MAE) in quality predictions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the value of rich, multi-dimensional annotations and reinforcement-based approaches for enhancing video quality assessment methodologies.

Abstract: Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is evolving beyond single-number mean opinion score toward richer, multi-faceted evaluations of video content. In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations and reinforcement-based alignment in advancing video quality assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DODO, a Vision-Language Model that utilizes block discrete diffusion for efficient Optical Character Recognition (OCR), achieving up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive models with near state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern OCR systems using Vision-Language Models rely heavily on autoregressive decoding, which is computationally expensive and slow, especially for long documents. The paper is motivated to overcome these inefficiencies while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: The authors propose DODO, a model leveraging block discrete diffusion for OCR. It decomposes the generation process into blocks to reduce synchronization errors, addressing the instabilities of existing masked diffusion models for deterministic tasks like OCR.

Result: DODO achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy in OCR tasks and offers up to 3x faster inference speeds compared to traditional autoregressive models.

Conclusion: By effectively utilizing block discrete diffusion, DODO represents a breakthrough in efficient and accurate OCR processing, providing a significant improvement in speed without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fundamental task for digitizing information, serving as a critical bridge between visual data and textual understanding. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater stereo depth estimation faces challenges due to wavelength-dependent light effects and the limitations of GRU-based methods in propagating disparities efficiently in large-disparity and textureless regions.

Result: StereoAdapter-2 achieves state-of-the-art results, improving zero-shot performance by 17% on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% on SQUID, with real-world validation on BlueROV2 showcasing its robustness.

Conclusion: StereoAdapter-2 efficiently addresses underwater depth estimation challenges through its novel ConvSS2D operator and large-scale synthetic dataset, achieving superior performance and robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is fundamental to underwater robotic perception, yet suffers from severe domain shifts caused by wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and refraction. Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

*Sakib Ahammed,Xia Cui,Xinqi Fan,Wenqi Lu,Moi Hoon Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI) in vision models, proposing a novel model, SemCovNet, for improving semantic fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models struggle with semantic bias, specifically Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), which affects learning of rare but meaningful features in datasets.

Method: The paper introduces SemCovNet, incorporating a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM), Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM), and Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss to address SCI.

Result: SemCovNet reduces Coverage Disparity Index (CDI) and enhances model reliability across multiple datasets, improving semantic fairness and interpretability.

Conclusion: This study identifies SCI as a key bias in vision models and provides measurable, effective methods to mitigate it, laying groundwork for fairer semantic learning.

Abstract: Modern vision models increasingly rely on rich semantic representations that extend beyond class labels to include descriptive concepts and contextual attributes. However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning.

TL;DR: Hyperspectral imaging combined with a stationary-camera NeRF framework enables efficient 3D reconstruction for analysis of agricultural produce, addressing challenges of high-throughput automated phenotyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving agricultural sustainability and phenotyping tasks requires accurate inspection methods integrating biochemical and morphological analyses, hindered by hardware complexity and throughput limitations.

Method: HSI-SC-NeRF employs stationary cameras with rotating objects in a diffuse illumination chamber, leveraging pose calibration and a multi-channel NeRF optimization approach for hyperspectral 3D reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves high spatial accuracy and spectral fidelity in reconstructed agricultural produce samples, providing robust visible and near-infrared spectrum analysis.

Conclusion: HSI-SC-NeRF offers a scalable solution for integrating hyperspectral 3D imaging into automated agricultural systems, supporting sustainable agriculture and breeding programs.

Abstract: Advances in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate, high-throughput characterization of agricultural produce quality and plant phenotypes, both essential for advancing agricultural sustainability and breeding programs. HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows.

*Dahye Kim,Deepti Ghadiyaram,Raghudeep Gadde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces dynamic tokenization in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce computational costs by varying patch sizes during denoising based on content complexity and timestep.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers excel in generation tasks but suffer inefficiency due to fixed patch sizes, leading to unnecessary high computation costs, especially in scenarios with varying content complexities.

Method: Dynamic tokenization adapts patch sizes during the denoising process based on the timestep and content complexity: coarse patches for early stages and finer patches for later stages.

Result: The method achieves significant computational speedups (up to 3.52× and 3.2×) without compromising perceptual image and video generation quality or prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Dynamic tokenization provides an efficient compromise for DiTs, maintaining high generation quality while substantially improving inference speed.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\times$ and $3.2\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.

### [123] [Characterizing the Predictive Impact of Modalities with Supervised Latent-Variable Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16979)
*Divyam Madaan,Sumit Chopra,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRIMO is a model addressing the challenge of missing modalities in multimodal learning by leveraging a latent-variable approach for imputation and prediction. It caters to both partial and full modality datasets and provides a way to quantify the importance of missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the practical challenge of incomplete multimodal data due to missing, asynchronous, or sparsely available modalities during training and inference, which limits the adaptability of existing MLLMs.

Method: PRIMO employs a latent-variable imputation model to reconstruct missing modalities, captures their relationships with available data for prediction, and evaluates their predictive impact through variance-based metrics.

Result: PRIMO achieved performance comparable to unimodal methods when modalities were missing and matched multimodal methods when all modalities were present across XOR synthetic datasets, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRIMO effectively handles incomplete multimodal data and offers insights into the predictive impact of absent modalities, making it suitable for real-world multimodal learning scenarios with imperfect datasets.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing approaches predominantly assume the availability of multiple modalities during training and inference. In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels.

*Eric Chen,Patricia Alves-Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a patch-based framework for identifying authorship in collaborative human-robot paintings, achieving up to 88.8% accuracy and quantifying stylistic overlaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing involvement of AI in creative works, documenting authorship has become essential for artistic, legal, and collection purposes.

Method: A case-study method using 15 paintings by one human and one robot is analyzed using a patch-based system on scanned images, employing cross-validation techniques to measure attribution accuracy.

Result: The method achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy and 86.7% painting-level accuracy, outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, Shannon entropy is used to measure stylistic overlaps with hybrid regions showing higher uncertainty.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient method for attributing authorship in human-AI collaborative artworks and sets the foundation for broader applications in data-scarce AI-human creative settings.

Abstract: As agentic AI becomes increasingly involved in creative production, documenting authorship has become critical for artists, collectors, and legal contexts. We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting.

TL;DR: PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework, improves single-image 3D generation by integrating an external part database with a diffusion transformer for editable and consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-image 3D generation struggles with diverse part geometries, multi-view consistency, and lacks fine-grained editing capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module, which aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents, and a part-level editor enabling targeted edits without regenerating entire objects.

Result: PartRAG shows improved quantitative performance, reducing Chamfer Distance and raising F-Score on benchmarks like Objaverse. It also provides faster inference and interactive editing capabilities.

Conclusion: PartRAG achieves competitive results with improved part structure fidelity, enabling efficient and precise model editing, addressing challenges in 3D generation.

Abstract: Single-image 3D generation with part-level structure remains challenging: learned priors struggle to cover the long tail of part geometries and maintain multi-view consistency, and existing systems provide limited support for precise, localized edits. We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s. Qualitatively, PartRAG produces sharper part boundaries, better thin-structure fidelity, and robust behavior on articulated objects. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PartRAG.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework to efficiently compress Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion transformers, introducing Amber-Image models that reduce computational costs significantly without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and deployment obstacles associated with large Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion transformer models.

Method: The authors develop Amber-Image models using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, hybrid-stream architecture, local weight averaging, distillation techniques, and fine-tuning, reducing parameters by 70%.

Result: Amber-Image models achieve high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering comparable to larger models, demonstrating cost-efficiency with fewer than 2,000 GPU hours required for the entire pipeline.

Conclusion: Amber-Image provides a cost-efficient and effective solution for compressing T2I models, significantly reducing computational burdens while maintaining performance levels.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures have significantly advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs and deployment barriers. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient compression framework that transforms the 60-layer dual-stream MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight models without training from scratch. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like DPG-Bench and LongText-Bench show that Amber-Image achieves high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering, matching much larger models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max pooling in anomaly detection can miss key structural cues; StructCore uses a structure-aware method to enhance detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalent max pooling method for image-level anomaly detection discards critical structural information, leading to overlaps in normal and anomalous scores.

Method: The paper proposes StructCore, a training-free scoring approach that uses a structural descriptor and Mahalanobis calibration to refine anomaly detection.

Result: StructCore achieves high anomaly detection accuracy with image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA.

Conclusion: StructCore enhances anomaly detection robustness by leveraging structural features, offering superior performance over traditional max pooling methods.

Abstract: Max pooling is the de facto standard for converting anomaly score maps into image-level decisions in memory-bank-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). However, because it relies on a single extreme response, it discards most information about how anomaly evidence is distributed and structured across the image, often causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap.
  We propose StructCore, a training-free, structure-aware image-level scoring method that goes beyond max pooling. Given an anomaly score map, StructCore computes a low-dimensional structural descriptor phi(S) that captures distributional and spatial characteristics, and refines image-level scoring via a diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from train-good samples, without modifying pixel-level localization.
  StructCore achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection by exploiting structural signatures missed by max pooling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cholec80-port, a trocar port segmentation dataset with geometrically consistent annotations, and demonstrates its advantages in improving cross-dataset robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trocar ports in laparoscopic surgery significantly obstruct visual processing pipelines by causing tracking and alignment issues, yet existing datasets have inconsistent or insufficient port annotations.

Method: The authors create the Cholec80-port dataset, implementing a rigorous annotation protocol (SOP) to mask only the trocar sleeves while excluding anatomical regions visible through the central openings. They also standardize and cleanse other public datasets under this protocol.

Result: Cholec80-port with consistent geometry-based annotations improves performance across datasets, enhancing robustness compared to increasing dataset size alone.

Conclusion: Geometrically accurate annotations of trocar ports can mitigate their disruptive effects on geometry-reliant visual tasks, benefiting surgical image analysis and downstream pipeline stability.

Abstract: Trocar ports are camera-fixed, pseudo-static structures that can persistently occlude laparoscopic views and attract disproportionate feature points due to specular, textured surfaces. This makes ports particularly detrimental to geometry-based downstream pipelines such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM, where dynamic or non-anatomical outliers degrade alignment and tracking stability. Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP. Experiments demonstrate that geometrically consistent annotations substantially improve cross-dataset robustness beyond what dataset size alone provides.

Result: CPL-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets for both anomaly detection and classifying abnormal events.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines temporal and semantic strengths, advancing the field of weakly supervised video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection aims to detect anomalies and identify abnormal categories with only video-level labels. We propose CPL-VAD, a dual-branch framework with cross pseudo labeling. The binary anomaly detection branch focuses on snippet-level anomaly localization, while the category classification branch leverages vision-language alignment to recognize abnormal event categories. By exchanging pseudo labels, the two branches transfer complementary strengths, combining temporal precision with semantic discrimination.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework, to improve gamma-ray burst (GRB) localization under challenging conditions of low photon statistics and noisy backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting faint GRBs from distant parts of the universe is crucial for understanding early star formation, but existing methods struggle due to low photon counts and high background noise.

Method: This work proposes ComptonUNet, a novel hybrid architecture combining raw data processing with image reconstruction to enhance GRB localization under challenging conditions.

Result: Simulations reveal that ComptonUNet surpasses existing approaches, achieving greater localization accuracy in low-photon and noisy background scenarios.

Conclusion: ComptonUNet provides a robust and effective solution for localizing weak GRBs, making it highly suitable for astrophysical missions in low-Earth orbit.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transient phenomena in the universe and serve as powerful probes for high-energy astrophysical processes. In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing with 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for more robust and efficient 3D scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of vision-based GS pipelines in adverse conditions such as poor weather, low illumination, and occlusions.

Method: Integrating RF sensing (e.g., automotive radar) with GS-based rendering, leveraging RF-informed depth inputs to initialize Gaussian functions and improve structural accuracy.

Result: The approach enables high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction, backed by numerical tests showing improved performance driven by RF-based input.

Conclusion: Incorporating RF sensing with GS renders robust 3D reconstructions even under challenging conditions, reducing reliance on traditional vision-based methods.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting segmentation is vital in real-time asset editing for film and gaming, but current methods face limitations such as reliance on predefined viewpoints, labels, or retraining.

Method: The method employs a Bayesian framework using Beta-Bernoulli updates and an analytic Expected Information Gain to guide adaptive view selection, ensuring efficiency in segmentation.

Result: The proposed B$^3$-Seg achieves comparable segmentation results to supervised methods while being fast, training-free, and camera-free, operating within seconds on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: B$^3$-Seg is a practical, interactive solution for 3DGS segmentation, offering a theoretically grounded and efficient alternative for real-time applications.

Abstract: Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation is essential for real-time editing of pre-reconstructed assets in film and game production. However, existing methods rely on predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency use. We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy. Experiments on multiple datasets show that B$^3$-Seg achieves competitive results to high-cost supervised methods while operating end-to-end segmentation within a few seconds. The results demonstrate that B$^3$-Seg enables practical, interactive 3DGS segmentation with provable information efficiency.

TL;DR: BadCLIP++ is a framework for backdoor attacks on multimodal contrastive learning models, overcoming challenges of stealthiness and persistence, achieving high attack success rates with minimal poisoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in backdoor attacks, specifically stealthiness and persistence, which are inadequately addressed by existing methods for multimodal contrastive learning models.

Method: Introduced semantic-fusion QR micro-triggers and target-aligned subset selection to enhance invisibility. Used techniques like radius shrinkage, centroid alignment, curvature control, and elastic weight consolidation for persistent effect. Supported by theoretical analysis for robustness.

Result: BadCLIP++ achieved 99.99% attack success rate with 0.3% poisoning, superior to baselines, and remained robust under defenses with minimal clean accuracy drop. Also achieved 65.03% success in physical attacks.

Conclusion: BadCLIP++ demonstrates high stealth, persistence, theoretical soundness, and effectiveness in backdoor attacks, outperforming baselines across various defense settings and offering robust performance with minimal trade-offs.

Abstract: Research on backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models faces two key challenges: stealthiness and persistence. Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes NRGS-SLAM, a novel monocular non-rigid SLAM system tailored for endoscopic scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve tracking and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing persistent challenges in V-SLAM for endoscopy, where soft-tissue deformations break rigidity assumptions, causing ambiguity between camera motion and tissue deformation.

Method: Introducing a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that integrates learnable deformation probabilities and a deformable tracking module with coarse-to-fine pose estimation. It also employs a robust geometric loss and an efficient mapping module.

Result: NRGS-SLAM demonstrates up to 50% improvement in camera pose estimation RMSE and offers higher-quality reconstructions on public endoscopic datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed NRGS-SLAM significantly enhances monocular non-rigid SLAM performance in endoscopy by effectively decoupling motion and deformation, and its effectiveness is corroborated through experiments and ablations.

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) is a fundamental capability for autonomous perception and navigation. However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

### [135] [Selective Training for Large Vision Language Models via Visual Information Gain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17186)
*Seulbi Lee,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Visual Information Gain (VIG), a metric for measuring how visual input reduces prediction uncertainty in LVLMs, and uses it to guide training for improved visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision Language Models often suffer from language bias by providing answers not grounded in visual evidence.

Method: The paper introduces VIG, a perplexity-based metric to analyze visual grounding and proposes a selective training scheme focusing on high-VIG samples and tokens.

Result: Using VIG-guided training enhances visual grounding and mitigates language bias in LVLMs with reduced supervision.

Conclusion: VIG is a promising metric for improving visual grounding in LVLMs, offering enhanced performance with more efficient training.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias, producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EntropyPrune, an efficient token-pruning method for multimodal large language models, achieving high efficiency and robust acceleration by identifying and pruning redundant information during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the high inference cost caused by processing numerous visual tokens per image in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and aims to provide a principled and interpretable approach for token pruning.

Method: The method, EntropyPrune, uses a matrix-entropy perspective to identify an 'Entropy Collapse Layer' (ECL) for selecting the pruning stage. It evaluates the information value of each visual token, prunes redundant ones, and employs spectral equivalence for efficient entropy computation, significantly reducing complexity.

Result: EntropyPrune outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in accuracy and efficiency. It achieves a 68.2% FLOP reduction while retaining 96.0% of performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B and generalizes effectively to diverse high-resolution and video-based models.

Conclusion: EntropyPrune is a robust and scalable framework for accelerating MLLMs, offering a significant performance-cost trade-off and reinforcing the benefits of matrix-entropy-guided token pruning in practical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) incur substantial inference cost due to the processing of hundreds of visual tokens per image. Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an "Entropy Collapse Layer" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/YahongWang1/EntropyPrune.

*Ye Zhu,Kaleb S. Newman,Johannes F. Lutzeyer,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to improve text-to-image generative models' diversity by controlling prompt-dependent and prompt-independent variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image generative models face challenges in producing diverse images for the same prompt, restricting user options and amplifying societal biases.

Method: GASS enhances diversity by decomposing CLIP embeddings into orthogonal directions: semantic variation and prompt-independent variation. It increases projection spread along these axes during sampling.

Result: Experiments with T2I backbones like U-Net, DiT, diffusion, and flow show improved diversity with minimal effect on image quality or semantic alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed GASS method effectively controls and enhances diversity in T2I models while preserving fidelity and alignment with prompts.

Abstract: Despite high semantic alignment, modern text-to-image (T2I) generative models still struggle to synthesize diverse images from a given prompt. This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.

*Yiming Xu,Yi Yang,Hao Cheng,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiMAP, a tracking-free framework for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving that remains reliable under MOT failures, presenting robust performance without relying on identity association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of motion forecasting in autonomous driving caused by failures in multi-object tracking (MOT) such as identity switches, missed detections, or occlusion, which compromise prediction quality and safety.

Method: Transform past detections into historical occupancy maps and use a historical query module to retrieve agent-specific histories, which are processed via a DETR-style decoder to predict multi-modal future trajectories without reliance on identity tracking.

Result: HiMAP demonstrates comparable performance to tracking-based methods on Argoverse~2 and outperforms baselines in no-tracking configurations with notable gains in FDE, ADE, and MR. It also achieves stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously.

Conclusion: HiMAP offers a reliable, tracking-free solution to trajectory prediction in autonomous driving scenarios, improving safety-critical systems by delivering robust performance without dependence on object tracking.

Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for autonomous driving, yet most predictors rely on multi-object tracking (MOT) with identity association, assuming that objects are correctly and continuously tracked. When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\% in FDE, 12\% in ADE, and a 4\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how AlphaEarth Embeddings can be utilized in DL models for surface height mapping, demonstrating strong performance, challenges with generalization, and the promise of enhancing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if AlphaEarth Embeddings and geospatial features can effectively guide DL regression models for terrain height mapping.

Method: U-Net and U-Net++ lightweight convolutional decoders were used to evaluate the geospatial information encoded in embeddings for terrain height estimation.

Result: Training performance showed $R^2 = 0.97$ for both models. Testing demonstrated U-Net++ superior generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared to U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), highlighting challenges with distribution shifts.

Conclusion: AlphaEarth Embeddings exhibit potential in height mapping workflows, especially when paired with spatial-aware architectures, but biases must be addressed for improved transferability.

Abstract: This study investigates whether the geospatial and multimodal features encoded in \textit{Earth Embeddings} can effectively guide deep learning (DL) regression models for regional surface height mapping. In particular, we focused on AlphaEarth Embeddings at 10 m spatial resolution and evaluated their capability to support terrain height inference using a high-quality Digital Surface Model (DSM) as reference. U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns. Overall, the results demonstrate the promising potential of AlphaEarth Embeddings to guide DL-based height mapping workflows, particularly when combined with spatially aware convolutional architectures, while emphasizing the need to address bias for improved regional transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed setup is a practical and effective solution for supporting infrastructure-based sensing and FSP operations, with high accuracy in freight vehicle monitoring.

Abstract: Freight vehicles approaching signalized intersections require reliable detection and motion estimation to support infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority (FSP). Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications.

Motivation: Current detection methods are inadequate for detecting advanced synthetic videos created by modern generators like Sora2 and Veo3.

Method: The paper introduces EA-Swin, a spatiotemporal detection model using a Swin Transformer with windowed attention, and a benchmark dataset, EA-Video, with 130K diverse videos.

Result: EA-Swin outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 0.97-0.99, surpassing prior methods by 5-20%, and generalizes well to unseen distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed EA-Swin model and EA-Video dataset provide a robust and scalable solution for detecting modern AI-generated synthetic videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation video generators such as Sora2, Veo3, and other commercial systems have produced highly realistic synthetic videos, exposing the limitations of existing detection methods that rely on shallow embedding trajectories, image-based adaptation, or computationally heavy MLLMs. We propose EA-Swin, an Embedding-Agnostic Swin Transformer that models spatiotemporal dependencies directly on pretrained video embeddings via a factorized windowed attention design, making it compatible with generic ViT-style patch-based encoders. Alongside the model, we construct the EA-Video dataset, a benchmark dataset comprising 130K videos that integrates newly collected samples with curated existing datasets, covering diverse commercial and open-source generators and including unseen-generator splits for rigorous cross-distribution evaluation. Extensive experiments show that EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior SoTA methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions, establishing a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced super-resolution method for satellite imagery of tropical cyclones, incorporating physical laws to achieve better meteorological fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the resolution of satellite images for tracking tropical cyclones often neglects the atmospheric physical laws, which are crucial for accurate representation and prediction.

Method: Developed a Physics Encoded Spatial and Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (PESTGAN), utilizing a generator with a PhyCell module to encode physical dynamics and a dual-discriminator framework for ensuring motion consistency and spatial realism.

Result: PESTGAN achieves superior performance in structural fidelity, meteorological plausibility, and perceptual quality, validated on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4x upscaling.

Conclusion: The method outperforms existing approaches in reconstructing high-resolution cyclone image sequences while maintaining physical and meteorological accuracy.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is indispensable for tracking the genesis, intensification, and trajectory of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, existing deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods often treat satellite image sequences as generic videos, neglecting the underlying atmospheric physical laws governing cloud motion. To address this, we propose a Physics Encoded Spatial and Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (PESTGAN) for TC image super-resolution. Specifically, we design a disentangled generator architecture incorporating a PhyCell module, which approximates the vorticity equation via constrained convolutions and encodes the resulting approximate physical dynamics as implicit latent representations to separate physical dynamics from visual textures. Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. While maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy compared to existing approaches, our method significantly excels in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces attachment anchors as an intermediate representation to improve grasping point prediction for autonomous tissue manipulation in colorectal surgeries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal surgeries, being complex and prolonged, are underrepresented in research despite their potential for autonomous, machine learning-driven assistance through repetitive tissue manipulation.

Method: The authors propose attachment anchors as a structured representation encoding local geometric and mechanical relationships in surgical scenes. They use machine learning to predict these anchors from laparoscopic images and integrate them into a grasping framework.

Result: Experiments on 90 colorectal surgeries show attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines, with strong performance even in out-of-distribution scenarios including unseen procedures and surgeons.

Conclusion: Attachment anchors are a promising intermediate representation that enhance learning-based tissue manipulation, particularly for complex and variable contexts such as colorectal surgery.

Abstract: Accurate grasping point prediction is a key challenge for autonomous tissue manipulation in minimally invasive surgery, particularly in complex and variable procedures such as colorectal interventions. Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting tampered text in document images by proposing a novel data generation pipeline for high-quality tampered documents, resulting in better model performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating tampered document images suffer from poor visual quality and limited variety, leading to models that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. The paper is motivated by the need to bridge this gap with improved data generation techniques.

Method: The paper introduces a framework for generating high-quality tampered documents, utilizing two auxiliary networks: one trained with contrastive learning to compare text crops and another to ensure accurate character enclosure in crops. Both are integrated into a robust, carefully designed generation pipeline.

Result: Models trained on datasets generated using the proposed method outperform those trained on datasets from existing approaches, consistently improving performance on multiple architectures and open-source datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed generation framework produces diverse and realistic tampered documents, addressing data scarcity and improving the generalization of models for detecting tampered text in document images.

Abstract: Detecting tampered text in document images is a challenging task due to data scarcity. To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: Polaffini is a deep learning-driven framework for anatomically grounded medical image registration using centroid-based feature points to achieve robust and accurate alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in intensity-based medical image registration and leverage advancements in deep learning for anatomically grounded algorithms.

Method: Polaffini uses pre-trained segmentation models to extract anatomical centroids, enabling global and local affine matching with adjustable smoothness for polyaffine transformations.

Result: Polaffini showcases superior structural alignment and effective pre-alignment performance compared to intensity-based techniques, proving its robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Polaffini is a highly effective framework for medical image registration, providing efficient, accurate, and robust solutions and fits well within medical image processing workflows.

Abstract: In this work we present Polaffini, a robust and versatile framework for anatomically grounded registration. Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.

TL;DR: A 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America is developed using deep learning on satellite data, revealing discrepancies in regulatory maps and supporting better deforestation policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To monitor tree crop expansion and resolve data limitations impacting zero-deforestation policies like the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR).

Method: A spatio-temporal deep learning model was trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite time series to produce a 10m-resolution map of tree crops in South America.

Result: The map identifies ~11 million hectares of tree crops, with 23% linked to forest loss from 2000-2020. Regulatory maps often misclassify smallholder agroforestry as forest, causing fairness issues.

Conclusion: This high-resolution map reduces risks of false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties, aiding more accurate and equitable conservation and agricultural policies.

Abstract: Monitoring tree crop expansion is vital for zero-deforestation policies like the European Union's Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR). However, these efforts are hindered by a lack of highresolution data distinguishing diverse agricultural systems from forests. Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as "forest". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable.

Motivation: Existing HTR systems using Transformers suffer from slow and memory-intensive decoding due to growing key-value (KV) cache.

Method: The authors propose a model that replaces softmax attention with softmax-free retention, uses multi-scale sequential priors, and introduces layer-wise gamma scaling to improve efficiency and capture both short- and long-range dependencies.

Result: DRetHTR achieves up to 1.9x faster inference, 38-42% less memory usage, and state-of-the-art or competitive character error rates on multiple datasets without a loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed DRetHTR demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet can match Transformer-level accuracy while offering significant gains in decoding speed and memory efficiency.

Abstract: State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems commonly use Transformers, whose growing key-value (KV) cache makes decoding slow and memory-intensive. We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency.

*Lorenzo Caselli,Marco Mistretta,Simone Magistri,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralGCD is proposed for identifying novel categories in unlabeled data using efficient multimodal representations via CLIP-based cross-modal similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches in Generalized Category Discovery face challenges like overfitting to known classes, treating modalities independently, and high computational costs.

Method: SpectralGCD uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as unified cross-modal representations, spectral filtering to refine useful concepts, and knowledge distillation to align the representations efficiently.

Result: SpectralGCD achieves comparable or better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks while using significantly less computational resources.

Conclusion: SpectralGCD is an effective and efficient solution for incorporating multimodal information into Generalized Category Discovery, enhancing semantic quality and performance at reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD.

*Xiaomeng Peng,Xilang Huang,Seon Han Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAGLE enhances industrial anomaly detection within multimodal large language models (MLLMs) without requiring fine-tuning, offering accurate detection and interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for industrial anomaly detection often lack detailed explanatory capabilities and require expensive fine-tuning.

Method: EAGLE integrates expert model outputs to guide MLLMs for better anomaly detection and semantic descriptions, without modifying the model parameters.

Result: EAGLE demonstrates improved performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuned methods.

Conclusion: By concentrating MLLMs' attention on anomaly regions, EAGLE provides tuning-free improvements in anomaly detection with interpretable explanations.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is important for smart manufacturing, but many deep learning approaches produce only binary decisions and provide limited semantic explanations. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local-EndoGS, a framework for monocular endoscopic 4D reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes with arbitrary camera motion, overcoming challenges of unreliable initialization and large motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing deformable surgical scenes from monocular endoscopic videos, especially under large motion scenarios and without depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion.

Method: It proposes Local-EndoGS, which uses a window-based global representation for local scene modeling, a coarse-to-fine strategy for initialization, and integrates pixel trajectory and motion priors for robust optimization.

Result: The framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry on three public datasets with varying deformable scenes and motions. Key designs were validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: Local-EndoGS demonstrates robust and high-quality 4D reconstruction for monocular endoscopic sequences, addressing prior limitations. It holds significant promise for clinical applications and surgical scene understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing deformable surgical scenes from endoscopic videos is challenging and clinically important. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs. Code will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/Local-EndoGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses counterfactual failures in Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) and introduces a benchmark (LIBERO-CF) for systematic analysis while proposing Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG) to reduce shortcuts and improve task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) frequently failing to accurately follow language instructions due to biases from dataset shortcuts, leading to counterfactual failures.

Method: Introduced the LIBERO-CF benchmark for evaluating VLAs in counterfactual setups and proposed Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a dual-branch inference scheme combining standard VLA policies with language-unconditioned Vision-Action modules for robust task execution.

Result: CAG showed improvements of 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks (using training-free strategy), further gains of 15.5% and 8.5% paired with a VA model, and real-world gains of 17.2% task success while reducing counterfactual failures by 9.4%.

Conclusion: Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG) successfully mitigates counterfactual failures, enhancing language grounding and task robustness without changing pretrained models or requiring additional demonstrations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models struggle with analyzing 2D quantum materials due to subtle contrast differences, insufficient labeled data, and variability in imaging setups. This study aims to address these limitations using a physics-aware approach.

Method: The study includes (1) Synthia, a synthetic data generator for optical simulation; (2) QMat-Instruct, a large-scale quantum materials dataset; (3) QuPAINT, a physics-aware multimodal model architecture; and (4) QF-Bench, a benchmarking dataset for evaluation.

Result: The proposed framework enables better understanding of material thickness and appearance and has been systematically tested across various imaging conditions.

Conclusion: Integrating physics-aware priors and a multimodal architecture makes the framework more effective and generalizable for analyzing 2D quantum materials, bridging data, model, and evaluation gaps in existing systems.

Abstract: Characterizing two-dimensional quantum materials from optical microscopy images is challenging due to the subtle layer-dependent contrast, limited labeled data, and significant variation across laboratories and imaging setups. Existing vision models struggle in this domain since they lack physical priors and cannot generalize to new materials or hardware conditions. This work presents a new physics-aware multimodal framework that addresses these limitations from both the data and model perspectives. We first present Synthia, a physics-based synthetic data generator that simulates realistic optical responses of quantum material flakes under thin-film interference. Synthia produces diverse and high-quality samples, helping reduce the dependence on expert manual annotation. We introduce QMat-Instruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset for quantum materials, comprising multimodal, physics-informed question-answer pairs designed to teach Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand the appearance and thickness of flakes. Then, we propose Physics-Aware Instruction Tuning (QuPAINT), a multimodal architecture that incorporates a Physics-Informed Attention module to fuse visual embeddings with optical priors, enabling more robust and discriminative flake representations. Finally, we establish QF-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple materials, substrates, and imaging settings, offering standardized protocols for fair and reproducible evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper improves Image Copy Detection (ICD) by introducing PixTrace for pixel-level tracking and CopyNCE for geometrically-guided contrastive loss, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICD methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to a lack of fine-grained correspondence learning.

Method: The authors developed PixTrace for spatial mapping and CopyNCE loss, enabling fine-grained patch similarity and suppressing noise in self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in ICD with improved interpretability on the DISC21 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level learning to address limitations in current ICD systems.

Abstract: Image Copy Detection (ICD) aims to identify manipulated content between image pairs through robust feature representation learning. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning. We address this limitation by exploiting the inherent geometric traceability in edited content through two key innovations. First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tumor localization in laparoscopic liver surgery by simplifying deformable registration methods and reducing expertise requirements.

Method: Improved tumor localization using laparoscopic depth maps, foundation pose estimators for camera-liver pose estimation, and non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) for deformation instead of finite-element models.

Result: The proposed pipeline achieved a 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 real patient cases and outperformed rigid-only registration approaches.

Conclusion: This framework offers clinically relevant accuracy while reducing engineering complexity, making it an effective alternative to finite-element-based deformation models.

Abstract: Augmented reality can improve tumor localization in laparoscopic liver surgery. Existing registration pipelines typically depend on organ contours; deformable (non-rigid) alignment is often handled with finite-element (FE) models coupled to dimensionality-reduction or machine-learning components. We integrate laparoscopic depth maps with a foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose estimation and replace FE-based deformation with non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) to lower engineering/modeling complexity and expertise requirements. On real patient data, the depth-augmented foundation pose approach achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases. Combined rigid-NICP registration outperformed rigid-only registration, demonstrating NICP as an efficient substitute for finite-element deformable models. This pipeline achieves clinically relevant accuracy while offering a lightweight, engineering-friendly alternative to FE-based deformation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LATA, a method to refine medical vision-language models (VLMs) predictions, improving efficiency and balance in zero-shot settings without needing training or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and efficiency of medical VLMs in zero-shot predictions under domain shifts while maintaining calibrated uncertainty.

Method: LATA is a label-free refinement using k-NN graph smoothing and failure-aware scoring for efficient and balanced prediction sets, maintaining validity through deterministic transformations.

Result: LATA consistently reduces prediction set size and class-conditioned coverage gaps across three medical VLMs and nine tasks, outperforming baselines with minimal compute and no training.

Conclusion: LATA sharpens zero-shot predictions for medical VLMs, offering an effective and efficient solution that preserves SCP guarantees, outperforming prior methods even in challenging settings.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) are strong zero-shot recognizers for medical imaging, but their reliability under domain shift hinges on calibrated uncertainty with guarantees. Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute. Comprehensive ablations and qualitative analyses show that \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} sharpens zero-shot predictions without compromising exchangeability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphThinker is a method to improve causal understanding in video reasoning by using event-based video scene graphs and reinforcement finetuning to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of causal understanding in video reasoning models, which causes hallucinations due to the absence of explicit causal structure modeling of events.

Method: The method constructs event-based video scene graphs to model intra- and inter-event relationships, and uses reinforcement finetuning with a visual attention reward to strengthen grounding and reduce hallucinations.

Result: GraphThinker outperforms prior methods on RexTime and VidHalluc datasets by better capturing object and event relations with precise event localization and fewer hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances causal reasoning in video models by incorporating event-level scene graphs and visual reinforcement, reducing hallucinations effectively.

Abstract: Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of training multimodal large language models for professional tool-based image editing, which suffers from a lack of verifiable and reliable reward signals due to the subjectivity of creative editing tasks.

Method: The method combines a reinforcement learning approach with a generalist reward model—a fine-tuned multimodal large language model—to interpret user editing instructions and provide dynamic feedback. It curates a dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and fine-tunes the reward model to provide scalar feedback for high-quality gradients.

Result: RetouchIQ significantly improves semantic consistency and perceptual quality in instruction-based image editing compared to previous software and large language model approaches.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of generalist reward-driven multimodal large language model agents as precise, flexible, and explainable assistants for professional image editing, effectively bridging aesthetic goals with fine-grained parameter control.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential for extending vision-language reasoning to professional tool-based image editing, enabling intuitive and creative editing. A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArtSound and ArtToMus, a novel dataset and framework for generating music directly from artworks without reliance on text-based translation or linguistic supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal systems for image-to-music generation are restricted by their focus on natural photographs and reliance on language to bridge the modalities. This limits the exploration of richer artistic content and direct visual-to-audio learning.

Method: The researchers created ArtSound, a dataset of artwork-music pairs enriched with captions, and developed ArtToMus, a diffusion-model-based framework mapping visual embeddings directly to music outputs without intermediate text conversion.

Result: ArtToMus produces musically coherent and stylistically-consistent outputs that align with visual features of artworks, despite achieving lower alignment scores compared to text-conditioned systems.

Conclusion: Direct visual-to-music generation is established as a challenging but meaningful research avenue, with potential applications in multimedia, cultural heritage, and creative AI fields. Resources will be shared publicly upon paper's acceptance.

Abstract: Music generation has advanced markedly through multimodal deep learning, enabling models to synthesize audio from text and, more recently, from images. However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper presents a geospatial discovery framework for efficiently identifying hidden targets in challenging environments with sparse data using active learning, meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the inefficiency of existing learning methods in uncovering hidden targets in geospatial settings with sparse and biased data, focusing on real-world constraints like environmental monitoring.

Method: The proposed method integrates active learning, meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. It introduces concept-weighted uncertainty sampling and relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategies.

Result: Experiments using real-world PFAS contamination data demonstrate the method's reliability in discovering targets with limited data and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently uncovers targets in geospatial settings under resource constraints, showcasing improved generalization and application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In many real-world settings, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, or public health, with costly and difficult data collection and dynamic environments, strategically sampling from unobserved regions is essential for efficiently uncovering hidden targets under tight resource constraints. Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment.

Method: CORAL uses Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with explicit query-key matching alignment. It integrates a correspondence distillation loss and an entropy minimization loss for better attention and alignment.

Result: CORAL improves global shape transfer and local detail preservation, outperforming the baseline, with validation through extensive ablations and a VLM-based evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: Explicit person-garment alignment via CORAL provides significant advancements in Virtual Try-On quality, emphasizing attention precision and robust correspondence matching.

Abstract: Existing methods for Virtual Try-On (VTON) often struggle to preserve fine garment details, especially in unpaired settings where accurate person-garment correspondence is required. These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.

*Pourya Shamsolmoali,Masoumeh Zareapoor,Eric Granger,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that improves upon one-shot object detection by using user feedback to refine predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of retrieving user-specified objects from complex scenes, especially under ambiguous or multi-similar object settings, and enhance accuracy beyond the one-shot capabilities of existing open-vocabulary detectors.

Method: The method leverages an Intent State (IS) to maintain positive and negative cues from user feedback and uses a contrastive alignment function to rank objects by simultaneously maximizing similarity to positive cues and penalizing negative ones.

Result: IntRec demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval accuracy, achieving a 35.4 AP on the LVIS dataset and outperforming other methods like OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE. It also shows a +7.9 AP improvement in the LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark after a single feedback session.

Conclusion: The results validate IntRec's effectiveness in enabling interactive object retrieval, suggesting the approach enhances retrieval accuracy without requiring additional supervision or substantial latency.

Abstract: Retrieving user-specified objects from complex scenes remains a challenging task, especially when queries are ambiguous or involve multiple similar objects. Existing open-vocabulary detectors operate in a one-shot manner, lacking the ability to refine predictions based on user feedback. To address this, we propose IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions based on user feedback. At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision. On LVIS, IntRec achieves 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE by +2.3, +3.7, and +0.5, respectively. On the challenging LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark, it improves performance by +7.9 AP over its one-shot baseline after a single corrective feedback, with less than 30 ms of added latency per interaction.

*Tyler Bonnen,Jitendra Malik,Angjoo Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel neural network modeling framework capable of predicting human-level 3D shape inferences without task-specific training, by leveraging visual-spatial cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve human-level performance in modeling 3D shape inferences, a long-standing challenge in visual intelligence that has not been solved by previous computational methods.

Method: The authors developed neural networks trained with a visual-spatial objective on naturalistic sensory datasets. These models predict spatial information (e.g., camera location, visual depth) from images without relying on object-related inductive biases. A zero-shot evaluation approach was used to compare model predictions to human performance on established 3D perception tasks.

Result: The models matched human accuracy in 3D shape inferences without task-specific training. Independent readouts also predicted fine-grained aspects of human behavior, such as error patterns and reaction times, showing close alignment with human perception processes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that human-level 3D perception can emerge from scalable learning objectives processing naturalistic visual-spatial data, highlighting parallels between model mechanisms and human perception. All associated data and code have been shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: Humans can infer the three-dimensional structure of objects from two-dimensional visual inputs. Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page.

TL;DR: OpenEarthAgent proposes a framework for geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery and reasoning traces to enhance multimodal reasoning in the remote sensing domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable agents to tackle challenges in multimodal reasoning within the remote sensing domain, including spatial, geographic, and analytical complexities.

Method: Developed OpenEarthAgent, a framework trained on verified reasoning steps using supervised fine-tuning and diverse geospatial datasets.

Result: The model achieves structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behavior across varied geospatial tasks, showing improvement over strong baselines.

Conclusion: OpenEarthAgent establishes a viable framework for tool-augmented geospatial reasoning, advancing multimodal analytical capabilities in complex domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has enabled agents that can interpret imagery, connect it with language, and perform structured analytical tasks. Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.

### [165] [Visual Insights into Agentic Optimization of Pervasive Stream Processing Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17282)
*Boris Sedlak,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services on edge devices, addressing challenges like scalability, service-specific policies, and resource conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently processing sensory data close to the source is vital for low-latency applications like smart cities. However, fluctuating demands, diverse service actions, and resource conflicts on edge devices pose challenges to achieving this efficiently.

Method: The study developed a platform enabling context-aware autoscaling for stream processing services, allowing monitoring and individualized scaling via service-specific parameters. A scaling agent learns and optimizes execution by exploring action spaces.

Result: The platform and scaling agent introduce advanced adaptability, understanding and optimizing service operations across different scenarios, as a proof-of-concept.

Conclusion: The solution demonstrates the feasibility of scalable and resource-aware stream processing at the edge, empowering developers with tools to efficiently manage and optimize services.

Abstract: Processing sensory data close to the data source, often involving Edge devices, promises low latency for pervasive applications, like smart cities. This commonly involves a multitude of processing services, executed with limited resources; this setup faces three problems: first, the application demand and the resource availability fluctuate, so the service execution must scale dynamically to sustain processing requirements (e.g., latency); second, each service permits different actions to adjust its operation, so they require individual scaling policies; third, without a higher-level mediator, services would cannibalize any resources of services co-located on the same device. This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge. Participants can revisit the demo contents as video summary and introductory poster, or build a custom agent by extending the artifact repository.

### [166] [Read-Modify-Writable Snapshots from Read/Write operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16903)
*Armando Castañeda,Braulio Ramses Hernández Martínez*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes two algorithms for RMWable snapshots using only read/write operations in shared-memory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether RMWable snapshots can be achieved using weaker read/write operations instead of traditionally powerful primitives.

Method: The paper develops two algorithms: one for a system with finite, known processes, and one for unbounded concurrency but finite participation.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrate that RMWable snapshots are achievable with read/write operations in both finite and unbounded models.

Conclusion: The study extends the capabilities of read/write operations, showing they are sufficient for RMWable snapshot implementations without relying on advanced primitives.

Abstract: In the context of asynchronous concurrent shared-memory systems, a snapshot algorithm allows failure-prone processes to concurrently and atomically write on the entries of a shared array MEM , and also atomically read the whole array. Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution.

*Zikai Zhang,Rui Hu,Jiahao Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fed-PLoRA, a federated fine-tuning framework that addresses challenges of heterogeneous client resources with an innovative approach, improving task accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning (FL) methods struggle with performance issues caused by heterogeneous resources and different LoRA ranks among clients.

Method: Fed-PLoRA incorporates Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA) to replace traditional LoRA modules and introduces a Select-N-Fold strategy to accommodate resource variance by folding modules before local training.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both accuracy and efficiency during extensive evaluations on LLM fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: Fed-PLoRA effectively addresses the noise and resource heterogeneity challenges in FL, enabling better performance while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in adapting to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Federated Learning (FL) extends this capability by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. However, practical deployments face challenges when clients have heterogeneous resources and thus adopt different LoRA ranks, leading to substantial initialization and aggregation noise that undermines performance. To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that Fed-PLoRA consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

*Anton Juerss,Vamsi Addanki,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Trivance is a novel AllReduce algorithm that optimizes latency and congestion on bidirectional ring and multidimensional torus networks, outperforming existing methods in many settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AllReduce algorithms face trade-offs between latency constraints and congestion minimization, particularly in direct-connect topologies like torus networks. A need exists for algorithms that are latency-optimal while also reducing communication distances and congestion.

Method: Trivance achieves $
log_3 n$ steps latency-optimality by exploiting bidirectional transmission ports and joint reductions to minimize congestion and communication distances. It adapts well to both ring and multidimensional torus networks.

Result: Trivance outperforms state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms with 5-30% improvements for small to large message sizes, providing strong benefits in high-bandwidth and multidimensional torus settings.

Conclusion: Trivance bridges the gap between latency-optimality and congestion reduction, making it an effective and efficient improvement for distributed training and inference workloads.

Abstract: AllReduce is a fundamental collective operation in distributed computing and a key performance bottleneck for large-scale training and inference. Its completion time is determined by the number of communication steps, which dominates latency-sensitive workloads, and the communication distance affecting both latency- and bandwidth-bound regimes. Direct-connect topologies, such as torus networks used in Google's TPUv4, are particularly prone to large communication distances due to limited bisection bandwidth. Latency-optimal algorithms such as Bruck's complete AllReduce in $\log_3 n$ steps on a bidirectional ring, but incur large communication distances that result in substantial congestion. In contrast, recent approaches such as Swing reduce communication distance and congestion, but are inherently required to perform $\log_2 n$ steps to complete AllReduce, sacrificing latency-optimality.
  In this paper, we present Trivance, a novel AllReduce algorithm that completes within $\log_3 n$ steps, while reducing congestion compared to Bruck's algorithm by a factor of three and preserving bandwidth-optimality. Trivance exploits both transmission ports of a bidirectional ring within each step to triple the communication distance along both directions simultaneously. Furthermore, by performing joint reductions, Trivance improves both the number of steps and network congestion. We further show that Trivance extends naturally to multidimensional torus networks, retaining its latency advantage while achieving performance comparable to bandwidth-optimal algorithms for large messages.
  Our empirical evaluation shows that Trivance improves state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% for message sizes up to 8\,MiB, in high-bandwidth settings up to 32MiB and for 3D tori up to 128MiB. Throughout the evaluation, Trivance remains the best-performing latency-optimal algorithm.

*Patrick Zojer,Jonas Posner,Taylan Özden*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of resource elasticity and malleable job scheduling to improve high-performance computing efficiency using real workload simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional job scheduling in HPC often leads to underutilized resources and high job waiting times, creating inefficiencies.

Method: Using ElastiSim software and workload traces from three supercomputers (Cori, Eagle, Theta), the paper simulates different proportions of malleable jobs and evaluates five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one.

Result: Compared to rigid workloads, malleable jobs reduced job turnaround times by 37-67%, makespan by 16-65%, wait times by 73-99%, and improved node utilization by 5-52%. Gains are substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.

Conclusion: Malleability proves instrumental in addressing inefficiencies in HPC, with even limited adoption yielding significant benefits. Encouraging its integration into HPC management systems is critical.

Abstract: Optimizing resource utilization in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters is essential for maximizing both system efficiency and user satisfaction. However, traditional rigid job scheduling often results in underutilized resources and increased job waiting times.
  This work evaluates the benefits of resource elasticity, where the job scheduler dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of malleable jobs at runtime. Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.
  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.
  This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies. These findings confirm the potential of malleability to address inefficiencies in current HPC practices and demonstrate that even limited adoption can provide substantial advantages, encouraging its integration into HPC resource management.

*Lelia Blin,Sylvain Gay,Isabella Ziccardi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for anonymous networks that operates using only O(log log n) bits of memory per node.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of designing a self-stabilizing leader election algorithm with minimal memory requirements for nodes in general graphs, an open problem in the field.

Method: The proposed algorithm operates in asynchronous networks, using probabilistic techniques and assuming knowledge of a global parameter (N = Θ(log n)), to converge to a unique leader configuration.

Result: The system converges almost surely to a stable state with a unique leader, stabilizing within O(poly(n)) rounds with high probability, while requiring just O(log log n) memory per node.

Conclusion: The paper achieves a significant result by reducing memory complexity to O(log log n) for leader election in anonymous networks and provides a probabilistic, space-efficient solution for the problem, but sacrifices silence and explicit termination detection.

Abstract: We study the self-stabilizing leader election problem in anonymous $n$-nodes networks. Achieving self-stabilization with low space memory complexity is particularly challenging, and designing space-optimal leader election algorithms remains an open problem for general graphs. In deterministic settings, it is known that $Ω(\log \log n)$ bits of memory per node are necessary [Blin et al., Disc. Math. \& Theor. Comput. Sci., 2023], while in probabilistic settings the same lower bound holds for some values of $n$, but only for an unfair scheduler [Beauquier et al., PODC 1999]. Several deterministic and probabilistic protocols have been proposed in models ranging from the state model to the population protocols. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing solutions either require $Ω(\log n)$ bits of memory per node for general worst case graphs, or achieve low state complexity only under restricted network topologies such as rings, trees, or bounded-degree graphs.
  In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses $O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory per node. Our algorithm operates in the state model under a synchronous scheduler and assumes knowledge of a global parameter $N = Θ(\log n)$. We show that, under our protocol, the system converges almost surely to a stable configuration with a unique leader and stabilizes within $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ rounds with high probability. To achieve $O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory, our algorithm keeps transmitting information after convergence, i.e. it does not verify the silence property. Moreover, like most works in the field, our algorithm does not provide explicit termination detection (i.e., nodes do not detect when the algorithm has converged).

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TopoSZp is a lightweight lossy compressor targeting large-scale HPC datasets, preserving critical topological structures efficiently with competitive performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art lossy compressors like SZ and ZFP fail to effectively preserve critical topological structures essential for scientific analysis while managing large HPC data volumes.

Method: TopoSZp incorporates topology-aware methods such as critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and saddle point refinement under relaxed error bounds. It builds upon the high-throughput SZp compressor.

Result: TopoSZp demonstrates up to 100x fewer non-preserved critical points, zero false positives, high compression/decompression speeds (100–10000x faster), and competitive ratios compared to topology-aware alternatives.

Conclusion: TopoSZp provides an efficient solution for preserving critical topological features in large HPC datasets with superior computational performance and error control.

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is essential for managing the massive data volumes produced by large-scale HPC simulations. While state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ and ZFP provide strong numerical error guarantees, they often fail to preserve topological structures (example, minima, maxima, and saddle points) that are critical for scientific analysis. Existing topology-aware compressors address this limitation but incur substantial computational overhead. We present TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware, error-controlled lossy compressor that preserves critical points and their relationships while maintaining high compression and decompression performance. Built on the high-throughput SZp compressor, TopoSZp integrates efficient critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and targeted saddle point refinement, all within a relaxed but strictly enforced error bound. Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates DAOS and Ceph, object storage systems, for their performance and suitability in HPC and AI applications, showing DAOS outperforms traditional systems like Ceph and Lustre in scalability and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for high-performing storage solutions to manage increasing data volumes in HPC and AI applications like Numerical Weather Prediction, due to challenges in POSIX file systems at scale.

Method: The authors developed software-level adapters and conducted extensive I/O benchmarking of DAOS and Ceph compared to Lustre, analyzing their performance, scalability, and flexibility.

Result: DAOS and Ceph showed excellent performance, with DAOS delivering superior scalability and flexibility, outperforming Lustre and Ceph in testing.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DAOS presents a promising future for HPC storage, particularly for scalable and flexible I/O, though it won't replace POSIX-like I/O entirely.

Abstract: Driven by scientific and industry ambition, HPC and AI applications such as operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) require processing and storing ever-increasing data volumes as fast as possible. Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads.
  This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.
  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVFetcher, a system leveraging GPU-native video codecs to efficiently reuse remote KV caches for LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency in leveraging remote KV caches for LLM inference in bandwidth-limited scenarios, where transmitting KV cache suffers from decompression overhead.

Method: They design KVFetcher, which compresses KV caches into compact video formats using a codec-friendly tensor layout and coordinates efficient pipelined transmission, decoding, and restoration.

Result: The proposed system achieves up to 3.51x reduction in TTFT while maintaining lossless model accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: KVFetcher improves LLM inference efficiency by utilizing GPU-native video codecs for compact KV cache coding and transmission, proving effective across diverse GPUs.

Abstract: Remote KV cache reuse fetches KV cache for identical contexts from remote storage, avoiding recomputation, accelerating LLM inference. While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods.

### [174] [Learning under noisy supervision is governed by a feedback-truth gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16829)
*Elan Schonfeld,Elias Wisnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure evaluation, a gap between feedback and truth emerges, which is a universal constraint across learning systems, whether neural networks or human cognition. Regulation strategies vary by system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how learning systems handle noisy feedback and the inherent feedback-truth gap caused by mismatched absorption rates of feedback versus task evaluation.

Method: The study tested a two-timescale learning model through experiments involving trained neural networks on noisy labels, human probabilistic reversal learning, and human reward/punishment learning with EEG analysis.

Result: The feedback-truth gap emerged universally across systems (neural networks, EEG, human learning) but manifested differently: neural networks showed memorization, sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed gaps, and humans displayed transient over-commitments that were corrected over time. Behavioral commitment amplified neural over-commitment.

Conclusion: The feedback-truth gap is a fundamental limitation in learning processes under noisy supervision. Regulation methods differ across systems, but understanding these mechanisms is crucial to improving learning reliability.

Abstract: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.

Method: The approach uses the MMCAformer model, which employs self-attention for learning macro traffic flow dependencies and cross-attention for integrating micro and macro features. It is trained with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss function.

Result: The proposed method outperformed baseline models, improving metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively. It also reduced prediction uncertainty, particularly under low-speed, congested traffic conditions.

Conclusion: Integrating micro driving behavior features from CV data significantly enhances speed prediction accuracy and reduces uncertainty, especially in challenging traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate speed prediction is crucial for proactive traffic management to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a low-cost, accessible method for identifying dementia risks in Brazil, enabling targeted interventions for vulnerable populations.

Method: The paper employed observational cross-sectional study, using data from ELSI-Brazil. Risk estimation was performed using Random Forest and multivariable logistic regression with selected variables.

Result: The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The Random Forest model showed better accuracy (AUC = 0.776) than logistic regression, identifying risk factors like illiteracy, advanced age, and depression while pinpointing protective factors like education and employment.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes low-cost strategies for dementia detection and suggests that public policies enhancing brain health could improve primary care and prevention measures in Brazil.

Abstract: To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil

TL;DR: The paper introduces a few-shot classification framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict electricity price spikes, showing comparable or superior performance to supervised models, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the prediction of electricity price spikes with minimal data, leveraging the data-efficiency of LLMs in scenarios where historical data is scarce.

Method: Aggregating system state information (demand, renewable generation, weather, etc.) into statistical features formatted as natural-language prompts processed by an LLM to predict spike likelihood and confidence.

Result: The proposed framework achieves performance comparable to Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and surpasses them when historical data availability is limited.

Conclusion: LLMs are proven as an effective and data-efficient method for classifying electricity price spikes, especially under data scarcity conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.

### [178] [Real-time Secondary Crash Likelihood Prediction Excluding Post Primary Crash Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16739)
*Lei Han,Mohamed Abdel-Aty,Zubayer Islam,Chenzhu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework for predicting secondary crash likelihood using real-time data, achieving high accuracy and outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prediction methods rely on post-crash features that are not viable for real-time application, leading to limited effectiveness.

Method: A dynamic spatiotemporal window extracts real-time traffic features for primary crashes, combined with ensemble learning and a voting mechanism across three models.

Result: The approach identified 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20, achieving significantly better predictive performance compared to previous studies.

Conclusion: This hybrid framework is highly effective in real-time secondary crash prediction and improves traffic management systems.

Abstract: Secondary crash likelihood prediction is a critical component of an active traffic management system to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts caused by secondary crashes. However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.

*Karan Bali,Jack Stanley,Praneet Suresh,Danilo Bzdok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the stability of transformer circuits across training runs, highlighting factors affecting representational similarity and functional divergence in attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether transformer circuits reliably emerge across independently trained instances, ensuring cross-instance robustness in deep learning models for safety-critical contexts.

Method: Systematic study of stability across refits in transformer language models, layer-level analysis of attention head representations, and evaluation of weight decay optimization's impact on stability.

Result: Middle layers show greatest instability and distinctiveness, deeper models diverge more in mid-layers, unstable heads exhibit increased functional importance, weight decay enhances stability, and residual streams are comparatively stable.

Conclusion: Cross-instance robustness of circuits is crucial for effective AI system oversight, promoting reliable interpretability methods for scalable monitoring and safety.

Abstract: In mechanistic interpretability, recent work scrutinizes transformer "circuits" - sparse, mono or multi layer sub computations, that may reflect human understandable functions. Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.

Conclusion: DeepVision-103K enhances the visual perception, reasoning, and reflection abilities of large multimodal models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been shown effective in enhancing the visual reflection and reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

*Zhangyi Liu,Huaizhi Qu,Xiaowei Yin,He Sun,Yanjun Han,Tianlong Chen,Zhun Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-Time Self-Consistency), a framework improving test-time reasoning efficiency by optimal trajectory allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under constrained computational budgets.

Method: Formulates a test-time trajectory allocation problem using an optimization framework. Defines a 'self-consistency rate' and connects allocation to crowdsourcing in the offline setting. In the online setting, it dynamically adjusts allocation to question difficulty.

Result: PETS achieves perfect self-consistency while reducing sampling budgets by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) on GPQA relative to uniform allocation.

Conclusion: PETS improves test-time performance by optimizing trajectory allocations with theoretical guarantees, making reasoning more efficient and scalable.

Abstract: Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

### [182] [Low-Dimensional and Transversely Curved Optimization Dynamics in Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16746)
*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates grokking—delayed generalization in neural networks—and finds that it reflects escape from low-dimensional metastable regimes through a geometric analysis of training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the causes of grokking, a poorly understood phenomenon where models transition from memorization to generalization during training on small algorithmic tasks.

Method: The authors analyzed training dynamics in transformers performing modular arithmetic using PCA on attention weights, studied curvature via gradient flow, and performed causal interventions.

Result: The study found the training evolves within a low-dimensional execution subspace, where curvature growth in orthogonal directions signals upcoming grokking. Causal exploration indicated that low-dimensional motion is crucial for generalization but increased curvature alone does not cause grokking.

Conclusion: The results suggest grokking results from escaping low-dimensional metastable confinement, characterized by learning trajectory geometry and curvature interactions, with causal dependency on the learned subspace dynamics.

Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed transition from memorization to generalization in small algorithmic tasks -- remains poorly understood. We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how two-layer neural networks solve the modular addition task, explains learned model dynamics, and introduces new concepts to characterize training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the feature learning process and training dynamics of two-layer neural networks for the modular addition task, filling gaps in prior explanations of feature combination.

Method: Used theoretical analysis and gradient flow analysis to identify learning conditions (phase symmetry and frequency diversification), describe phase coupling dynamics, and explain generalization via a lottery ticket mechanism.

Result: The network learns noisy neuron signals that combine robustly via phase symmetry and majority voting, emerging through competition mechanisms under random initialization. It also explains the grokking phenomenon as a three-stage learning process.

Conclusion: The findings offer a complete explanation of how neural networks solve modular addition tasks, characterizing feature learning, training dynamics, and generalization under overparameterization.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of how two-layer neural networks learn features to solve the modular addition task. Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the "winner" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma. Finally, we use these insights to demystify grokking, characterizing it as a three-stage process involving memorization followed by two generalization phases, driven by the competition between loss minimization and weight decay.

Abstract: The reliability of medical LLM evaluation is critically undermined by data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, leading to inflated scores on static benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Wi-Fi localization methods face inaccuracies due to suboptimal weighting of information from different routers, limiting their performance across environments.

Method: The authors introduce attention layers into a machine learning localization architecture to assign different weights to routers during information aggregation, inspired by traditional weighted triangulation.

Result: The proposed Attention to Routers approach achieves over 30% accuracy improvement compared to the benchmark on open-source datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating router-specific weighting via attention mechanisms significantly enhances Wi-Fi-based localization accuracy, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Modern machine learning-based wireless localization using Wi-Fi signals continues to face significant challenges in achieving groundbreaking performance across diverse environments. A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance. We have also shown through evaluation over the open-sourced datasets and demonstrate that Attention to Routers outperforms the benchmark architecture by over 30% in accuracy.

TL;DR: The study introduces a general framework for detecting and reducing redundant data (ballast) across diverse data types using various analytical methods and presents a novel Ballast Score for optimized pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of redundant or low-utility data in modern datasets, which increases complexity and resource consumption without improving analysis results.

Method: The authors propose using entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modeling, and embedding analysis to identify ballast features, then applying the newly developed Ballast Score for unified pruning.

Result: Experimental results show up to 70% of ballast features in sparse or semi-structured data can be removed while maintaining or improving classification performance and achieving reductions in training time and memory usage.

Conclusion: The framework enhances machine learning pipelines by categorizing ballast types and offering strategies for more efficient data processing and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain ballast as redundant or low-utility information that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational cost without contributing meaningful analytical value. This study introduces a generalized, multimodal framework for ballast detection and reduction across structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and sparse data types. Using diverse datasets, entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modelling, and embedding analysis are applied to identify and eliminate ballast features. A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint. The framework reveals distinct ballast typologies (e.g. statistical, semantic, infrastructural), and offers practical guidance for leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines.

*Alex Moody,Penina Axelrad,Rebecca Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates a machine learning (ML) approach to enhance the accuracy of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite propagation, focusing on Gaussian-based uncertainty handling and error correction from mismodeled atmospheric drag.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately propagating LEO satellite orbits is critical for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. However, conventional Gaussian assumptions on error distributions can become invalid due to atmospheric drag mismodeling, leading to unreliable system performance.

Method: The authors propose an ML approach (using both a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process) to predict and correct errors in the argument of latitude for LEO satellites. These corrections improve the Gaussian distribution modeling and accuracy using open-source datasets and VCM-derived ephemerides.

Result: The proposed ML models successfully predict and correct error growth caused by mismodeled drag, improving the Gaussian distribution accuracy and extending the VCM epoch's applicability to longer durations.

Conclusion: This framework enables more reliable LEO satellite orbit predictions over extended timelines and preserves key functionalities of existing systems, making it a robust tool for improved PNT services.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are leveraged to support new position, navigation, and timing (PNT) service alternatives to GNSS. These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KD-UFSL, a privacy-centric method for federated learning by employing microaggregation and differential privacy to safeguard data while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy vulnerabilities in U-shaped federated split learning, where intermediate representations can expose clients' private data to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors propose KD-UFSL, integrating k-anonymity with differential privacy techniques, to enhance the privacy of intermediate data representations shared in federated learning systems.

Result: KD-UFSL increases reconstruction error by 50% and decreases structural similarity by 40%, demonstrating better privacy protection without significantly sacrificing the utility of the global model.

Conclusion: KD-UFSL offers an effective balance between privacy and utility, making it suitable for large-scale big data scenarios requiring secure decentralized machine learning.

Abstract: Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.

*Victoria Lin,Louis-Philippe Morency,Eli Ben-Michael*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses language models' vulnerabilities to unobservable distribution shifts and proposes a framework to improve their out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models suffer from performance issues when evaluated on data outside their training distribution.

Method: The authors identify omitted variable bias and propose a framework to bound worst-case generalization performance under distribution shifts, incorporating these bounds into evaluation and optimization.

Result: Empirical experiments show improved out-of-distribution performance and better understanding of omitted variables with the proposed method.

Conclusion: Using the introduced framework, language models demonstrate stronger resilience against distribution shifts and improved evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, modern language models remain susceptible to distribution shifts, exhibiting brittle behavior when evaluated on data that differs in distribution from their training data. In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.

TL;DR: This paper proposes OSI-FL, a framework that addresses communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting in federated learning for large-scale, incremental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning struggles with large, dispersed, and privacy-sensitive data, especially in scenarios with incremental tasks and limited communications.

Method: A frozen Vision-Language Model (VLM) generates embeddings that are transferred to a server. A diffusion model synthesizes data from these embeddings for training, and Selective Sample Retention (SSR) prevents forgetting.

Result: OSI-FL performs better than traditional and one-shot FL frameworks in handling incremental learning on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Using OSI-FL improves federated learning by addressing challenges of privacy, communication constraints, and catastrophic forgetting, making it useful for real-world incremental data scenarios.

Abstract: Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.

### [191] [Better Think Thrice: Learning to Reason Causally with Double Counterfactual Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16787)
*Victoria Lin,Xinnuo Xu,Rachel Lawrence,Risa Ueno,Amit Sharma,Javier Gonzalez,Niranjani Prasad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Double Counterfactual Consistency (DCC), a method to evaluate and improve the causal reasoning of large language models (LLMs) without requiring labeled counterfactual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) often struggle with counterfactual questions, highlighting weaknesses in their causal reasoning abilities. However, generating labeled counterfactual data for testing and improving these models is challenging due to its vast scope.

Method: The authors introduced DCC, which measures and guides causality by assessing if models can handle causal intervention and counterfactual prediction, eliminating the need for labeled data. They also showed how DCC can be used in rejection sampling during inference to enhance LLM output.

Result: DCC was used to evaluate several leading LLMs on causal reasoning tasks, measuring their capabilities and responses to causal interventions. Additionally, DCC improved reasoning task performance in a training-free, test-time environment.

Conclusion: DCC is a lightweight, effective tool for assessing and enhancing LLMs’ causal reasoning abilities, offering a scalable alternative to labeled counterfactual data.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning benchmarks, large language models (LLMs) have proven brittle when presented with counterfactual questions, suggesting weaknesses in their causal reasoning ability. While recent work has demonstrated that labeled counterfactual tasks can be useful benchmarks of LLMs' causal reasoning, producing such data at the scale required to cover the vast potential space of counterfactuals is limited. In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-effective and high-performing inference pipeline for solving IMO-style math problems using general-purpose models. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IMO-ProofBench Advanced benchmark, addressing existing solver-grader issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high inference costs and grader failure issues prevalent in solving IMO-style math problems, enabling accessibility while maintaining high performance.

Method: The method involves an advanced inference pipeline that uses conjecture extraction, isolating and independently verifying candidate lemmas in fresh contexts to overcome solver-grader failures.

Result: The pipeline achieved 67.1% success rate on IMO-ProofBench Advanced using Gemini 3.0 Pro, doubling the performance of the next best public methods while significantly reducing costs to ~$31 per question.

Conclusion: This pipeline successfully demonstrates that efficient and cost-effective solutions for complex math reasoning problems can be achieved using only publicly available models and strategic methodological refinements.

Abstract: In the past year, custom and unreleased math reasoning models reached gold medal performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Similar performance was then reported using large-scale inference on publicly available models but at prohibitive costs (e.g., 3000 USD per problem). In this work, we present an inference pipeline that attains best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems at an average inference cost orders of magnitude below competing methods while using only general-purpose off-the-shelf models. Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD. At the time of evaluation, this represented the state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, and more than doubles the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline, all at a fraction of the cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies challenges in multi-expert Learning to Defer (L2D) systems due to inherent classifier underfitting, introduces PiCCE method to resolve expert identifiability issues, and demonstrates improved performance through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation in multi-expert Learning to Defer (L2D) systems caused by classifier underfitting and expert identifiability challenges, which limit the applicability of existing remedies.

Method: The authors propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that dynamically selects the most reliable expert by leveraging empirical evidence, effectively simplifying the multi-expert system to a single-expert-like model.

Result: PiCCE resolves multi-expert underfitting, recovers class probabilities and expert accuracies, and demonstrates statistical consistency. Experiments show its performance improvements across diverse setups, including real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PiCCE effectively mitigates challenges in multi-expert L2D systems, offering a scalable solution that enhances prediction performance and expert selection reliability.

Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) enables a classifier to abstain from predictions and defer to an expert, and has recently been extended to multi-expert settings. In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance.

*Zifan Wang,Riccardo De Santi,Xiaoyu Mo,Michael M. Zavlanos,Andreas Krause,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), an efficient algorithm for shaping lower and upper tails of reward distributions in fine-tuning diffusion and flow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of mechanisms for shaping tail behaviors in current entropy-regularized fine-tuning methods, which are crucial for improving reliability and enabling discovery in downstream applications.

Method: The authors propose TFFT, which uses Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to target both high-reward (right-CVaR) and low-reward (left-CVaR) tail outcomes. The method uses a variational dual formulation of CVaR and decomposes the process into two steps: threshold optimization and entropy-regularized fine-tuning with a pseudo-reward.

Result: TFFT achieves tail-shaping efficiently with low computational overhead, performing well across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design.

Conclusion: TFFT is a principled, efficient algorithm enabling fine-tuning for tailored reliability and exploration in diffusion and flow models, leveraging CVaR for practical, computationally efficient implementation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion and flow models to optimize downstream utilities is central to real-world deployment. Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TFFT across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoFlow is an AI model that improves air quality prediction by integrating physics principles like topography and wind into its neural network architecture, achieving superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in high-resolution air quality prediction by explicitly incorporating physical factors such as topography and wind direction into learning frameworks.

Method: A physics-guided neural network based on a vision transformer architecture, featuring topography-aware attention and wind-guided patch reordering mechanisms, trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data.

Result: Achieved a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 µg/m³—showing a 71–80% improvement over operational systems and a 13% improvement over AI baselines—while maintaining errors under China's air quality threshold.

Conclusion: Integrating physical processes into neural networks advances accuracy and reliability in air quality predictions across pollutants and timeframes.

Abstract: We propose TopoFlow (Topography-aware pollutant Flow learning), a physics-guided neural network for efficient, high-resolution air quality prediction. To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel algorithm, radVI, to improve Variational Inference (VI) by optimizing over radial profiles for better approximation of high-dimensional distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of Gaussian distributions in VI failing to capture the correct radial profile of high-dimensional distributions, which often leads to poor coverage.

Method: The proposed method, radVI, optimizes over radial profiles as an add-on to existing VI schemes, leveraging optimization techniques over Wasserstein space and radial transport maps.

Result: The algorithm provides theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrates effectiveness when added to methods like Gaussian VI and Laplace approximation.

Conclusion: radVI improves coverage and accuracy in VI by better approximating the target distribution's radial profile, making it a valuable enhancement to existing VI techniques.

Abstract: In variational inference (VI), the practitioner approximates a high-dimensional distribution $π$ with a simple surrogate one, often a (product) Gaussian distribution. However, in many cases of practical interest, Gaussian distributions might not capture the correct radial profile of $π$, resulting in poor coverage. In this work, we approach the VI problem from the perspective of optimizing over these radial profiles. Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).

TL;DR: The paper presents automated algorithms for circuit discovery in neural network interpretability with provable guarantees, outperforming prior heuristic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of provable guarantees in traditional circuit discovery methods for neural networks, the paper seeks to ensure reliability and robustness in interpretability.

Method: Leveraging advances in neural network verification, the authors develop algorithms that secure three types of guarantees: input domain robustness, robust patching, and minimality.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that their algorithms provide circuits with significantly stronger robustness guarantees compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods establish a rigorous and principled approach to provable circuit discovery, enriching mechanistic interpretability and advancing current methodologies.

Abstract: *Automated circuit discovery* is a central tool in mechanistic interpretability for identifying the internal components of neural networks responsible for specific behaviors. While prior methods have made significant progress, they typically depend on heuristics or approximations and do not offer provable guarantees over continuous input domains for the resulting circuits. In this work, we leverage recent advances in neural network verification to propose a suite of automated algorithms that yield circuits with *provable guarantees*. We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.

*Corinna Cortes,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular approach using domain-specific expert models with a gating mechanism to outperform monolithic models in both efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the resource intensity and reliance on heuristic dataset weighting in training large-scale generative models.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework that employs pre-trained experts combined through a robust gating mechanism, minimizing heuristic tuning by formulating the problem as a minimax game. A scalable stochastic algorithm and structural distillation method are also proposed.

Result: The modular approach is theoretically proven to generalize well and empirically shown to mitigate gradient conflicts in real-world and synthetic datasets. It outperforms monolithic models under specific conditions.

Conclusion: Modularity in generative modeling provides a practical and effective alternative that is theoretically robust, scalable, and less dependent on heuristic tuning.

Abstract: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.

Motivation: Current ToM reasoning methods primarily operate in small, simplified environments and do not scale well to realistic, complex domains.

Method: They propose HiVAE, a three-level hierarchical variational architecture inspired by the belief-desire-intention framework of human cognition.

Result: HiVAE achieves significant performance gains in a complex campus navigation task but shows limitations in grounding latent representations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved strategies to align learned latent representations with actual mental states, encouraging community input on solutions.

Abstract: Theory of mind (ToM) enables AI systems to infer agents' hidden goals and mental states, but existing approaches focus mainly on small human understandable gridworld spaces. We introduce HiVAE, a hierarchical variational architecture that scales ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains. Inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, our three-level VAE hierarchy achieves substantial performance improvements on a 3,185-node campus navigation task. However, we identify a critical limitation: while our hierarchical structure improves prediction, learned latent representations lack explicit grounding to actual mental states. We propose self-supervised alignment strategies and present this work to solicit community feedback on grounding approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Verbalized Action Masking (VAM) to address exploration challenges in reinforcement learning with large language models. By verbalizing action masks and iteratively pruning the action space, the approach improves exploration and performance. It is tested in chess and shows improved efficiency over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration in reinforcement learning post-training of large language models faces bottlenecks due to sparse feedback and large action spaces, leading to repetitive and inefficient behaviors.

Method: The authors propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which involves verbalizing action masks in prompts and enforcing outputs from specific actions. They further introduce an iterative action-space pruning mechanism to refine the sampled actions repeatedly until achieving a target or exhausting the budget.

Result: Experiments on chess tasks demonstrate that VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance metrics like average centipawn loss (ACPL), surpassing strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that verbalized action masking is an effective technique to facilitate controllable exploration in reinforcement learning with large language models, making it a practical tool for improving performance and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Exploration remains a key bottleneck for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors. We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores and resolves the mismatch between theoretical predictions and practical observations about position bias in Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the architectural origins of position bias in Transformer models and address the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and practical observations.

Method: The paper introduces a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout, incorporating residual connections to study attention behaviors in Transformers under causal masking.

Result: It demonstrates that residual connections prevent the expected collapse of attention onto the first token and proves a U-shaped position bias at finite depth, explaining the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.

Conclusion: The study provides a principled architectural explanation for position bias in Transformers and reconciles theoretical attention rollout predictions with practical outcomes.

Abstract: Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, yet the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. Under causal masking at infinite depth, prior theoretical analyses of attention rollout predict an inevitable collapse of attention onto the first token. Such collapse, however, does not occur in practice. We resolve this discrepancy with a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout. By incorporating residual connections, we show that this architectural component prevents collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens. This result provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anchored E-Watermarking, a framework designed to efficiently detect machine-generated text with anytime-valid inference and reduced token detection costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for distinguishing machine-generated content from human-authored text in light of the increasing use of Large Language Models.

Method: Developing an e-value-based watermarking framework using optimal sampling and anytime-valid inference, with an anchor distribution for accurate approximation.

Result: The framework reduces token detection costs by 13-15% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Anchored E-Watermarking allows for efficient and valid early detection of machine-generated content while maintaining statistical guarantees.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Zeliang Zhang,Xiaodong Liu,Hao Cheng,Hao Sun,Chenliang Xu,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Progressive Thought Encoding to improve reasoning efficiency and accuracy in large reasoning models (LRMs), while optimizing memory use during reinforcement learning (RL) training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs face inefficiencies in RL training due to long rollouts and high memory requirements during autoregressive decoding, which can degrade their reasoning performance under fixed memory constraints.

Method: Progressive Thought Encoding fine-tunes LRMs by encoding intermediate reasoning steps into fixed-size vector representations, reducing memory usage and maintaining constant memory during inference without compromising reasoning capabilities.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves performance (+19.3% over LoRA and +29.9% over un-tuned LRMs) and reasoning accuracy (+23.4 on AIME2024/2025 benchmark) under tight cache budgets. It is scalable and efficient under real-world memory constraints.

Conclusion: Progressive Thought Encoding enhances reasoning accuracy and enables efficient RL training for LRMs, making them more scalable and effective in memory-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

*Shayan Kiyani,Sima Noorani,George Pappas,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies verification processes in reasoning systems using language models, differentiating between weak (internal) and strong (external) verification, and develops optimal policies and algorithms to manage error control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient and reliable verification methods in reasoning systems with language models to balance trustworthiness and scalability.

Method: Formalized verification policies, introduced metrics to measure errors, studied two-threshold policy structures, and developed an online algorithm to control errors without assumptions.

Result: The research establishes a structure for optimal verification policies, highlights the relationship between calibration and verifier sharpness, and proposes an algorithm for controlling acceptance and rejection errors.

Conclusion: Optimal verification combines weak and strong methods effectively, and the proposed algorithm ensures error management, enhancing trust in reasoning systems.

Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.

### [206] [What is the Value of Censored Data? An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16842)
*Rachitesh Kumar,Omar Mouchtaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the offline newsvendor problem with censored demand data and derives methods to reduce infinite-dimensional optimization challenges to finite dimensions, enabling better policy evaluations and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve understanding and solutions for the offline newsvendor problem in cases where demand is censored due to inventory limitations and only sales data is available.

Method: The authors developed a method to transform an infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which allows for precise evaluation of inventory policies under censored demand conditions.

Result: Key findings include the identification of the limitations of passive sales data in handling demand censoring and the significant improvement offered by targeted exploration strategies, even in cases of heavy censoring.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of quality demand recording systems and targeted inventory strategies in achieving near-optimal performance in inventory management, underlining the risks of treating sales data as equivalent to demand in censored scenarios.

Abstract: We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.

*Daniel Durstewitz,Christoph Jürgen Hemmer,Florian Hess,Charlotte Ricarda Doll,Lukas Eisenmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes incorporating a dynamical systems (DS) perspective and DS reconstruction (DSR) approaches to enhance time series (TS) modeling for better forecasting, reduced computational demand, and improved theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to enhance the effectiveness of time series modeling by shifting focus towards a dynamical systems perspective. Current TS modeling methods often overlook insights that DS theory can provide, particularly in addressing long-term forecasting, system dynamics, and generalizability.

Method: The authors propose integrating methods from dynamical systems theory, coupled with DS reconstruction (DSR) techniques, to create surrogate models that better reflect underlying system dynamics. They explore how DS principles can enhance TS modeling, forecasting precision, and efficiency while providing theoretical analysis.

Result: The paper demonstrates that DS-based models could improve short- and long-term forecasting capabilities, offer insights into theoretical performance limits, generalization potential in unseen conditions, and enable computational and memory-efficient TS modeling.

Conclusion: The field of time series modeling can gain significant improvement by adopting insights and methodologies from dynamical systems theory, particularly through DS reconstruction techniques, ensuring better prediction capabilities, theoretical understanding, and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring robustness against data poisoning during neural network training remains a significant challenge, necessitating precise methods for evaluation and certification.

Method: The authors formulate the problem of adversarial data poisoning and neural network training in a unified MIQCP framework to derive worst-case attacks and certify the robustness of the training pipeline.

Result: Experimental results on small neural network models validate the framework's ability to completely characterize robustness against data poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: This work provides the first exact certification of training-time robustness in neural networks by bounding both the adversarial attack potential and its impact on the training pipeline.

Abstract: This work introduces a verification framework that provides both sound and complete guarantees for data poisoning attacks during neural network training. We formulate adversarial data manipulation, model training, and test-time evaluation in a single mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQCP) problem. Finding the global optimum of the proposed formulation provably yields worst-case poisoning attacks, while simultaneously bounding the effectiveness of all possible attacks on the given training pipeline. Our framework encodes both the gradient-based training dynamics and model evaluation at test time, enabling the first exact certification of training-time robustness. Experimental evaluation on small models confirms that our approach delivers a complete characterization of robustness against data poisoning.

*Chuqin Geng,Li Zhang,Haolin Ye,Ziyu Zhao,Yuhe Jiang,Tara Saba,Xinyu Wang,Xujie Si*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SymGraph, a symbolic GNN framework that addresses limitations of traditional GNNs by improving expressiveness and interpretability while being faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs face challenges in trustworthiness due to their black-box nature, and self-explainable GNNs inherit expressivity and interpretability limitations.

Method: SymGraph replaces continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, surpassing the 1-WL expressivity barrier.

Result: SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, with training speedups of 10x to 100x, and generates semantically granular rules.

Conclusion: SymGraph offers a powerful and interpretable alternative to existing GNNs, enhancing scientific discovery potential and making explainable AI more practical.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.

TL;DR: This paper presents Neuro-Symbolic Graph Generative Modeling (NSGGM), combining neural models and symbolic reasoning for molecule generation with interpretability and guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance molecule and graph generation with controllability, interpretability, and compliance with structural rules, addressing limitations in existing deep learning black-box approaches.

Method: The NSGGM framework combines a neural autoregressive model for scaffold prediction and refinement with an SMT solver to construct graphs that adhere to chemical and structural constraints.

Result: NSGGM achieves strong performance in both unconstrained and constrained molecule generation tasks, surpassing pure neural methods in controllability and compliance.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic methods like NSGGM can achieve state-of-the-art generation while enabling explicit control, guarantees, and interpretability. A new benchmark for testing controllability is also introduced.

Abstract: We challenge black-box purely deep neural approaches for molecules and graph generation, which are limited in controllability and lack formal guarantees. We introduce Neuro-Symbolic Graph Generative Modeling (NSGGM), a neurosymbolic framework that reapproaches molecule generation as a scaffold and interaction learning task with symbolic assembly. An autoregressive neural model proposes scaffolds and refines interaction signals, and a CPU-efficient SMT solver constructs full graphs while enforcing chemical validity, structural rules, and user-specific constraints, yielding molecules that are correct by construction and interpretable control that pure neural methods cannot provide. NSGGM delivers strong performance on both unconstrained generation and constrained generation tasks, demonstrating that neuro-symbolic modeling can match state-of-the-art generative performance while offering explicit controllability and guarantees. To evaluate more nuanced controllability, we also introduce a Logical-Constraint Molecular Benchmark, designed to test strict hard-rule satisfaction in workflows that require explicit, interpretable specifications together with verifiable compliance.

*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a communication-free policy for decentralized multi-player stochastic bandits over continuous action spaces with hard collisions, achieving near-optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of designing decentralized policies to maximize collective rewards in multi-player bandit settings with Lipschitz structure and collision constraints, without relying on communication and maintaining time horizon-independent coordination costs.

Method: The authors propose a modular protocol involving a maxima-directed search for player coordination and division of the problem into independent single-player bandits, achieving near-optimal regret bounds.

Result: A regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$, plus a time horizon-independent coordination cost, is achieved, matching the single-player rate and extending to general collision models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel and effective solution for decentralized multi-player bandit problems with hard collisions, achieving competitive performance and generalizing to various collision models.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player stochastic bandit problem over a continuous, Lipschitz-structured action space where hard collisions yield zero reward. Our objective is to design a communication-free policy that maximizes collective reward, with coordination costs that are independent of the time horizon $T$. We propose a modular protocol that first solves the multi-agent coordination problem -- identifying and seating players on distinct high-value regions via a novel maxima-directed search -- and then decouples the problem into $N$ independent single-player Lipschitz bandits. We establish a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ plus a $T$-independent coordination cost, matching the single-player rate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework providing such guarantees, and it extends to general distance-threshold collision models.

### [212] [A Unified Framework for Locality in Scalable MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16966)
*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of dimensionality in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by introducing a policy-dependent approach for locality and presenting a new spectral condition for improved guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the curse of dimensionality in scalable MARL by exploring policy-dependent factors instead of solely relying on worst-case environment conditions.

Method: The authors propose a novel decomposition for the policy-induced interdependence matrix to decouple the environment and policy sensitivities, enabling tighter spectral conditions for locality guarantees.

Result: They establish a general spectral condition for exponential decay of value functions that outperforms existing norm-based conditions and apply this to a localized policy improvement framework.

Conclusion: The study introduces a policy-dependent perspective for MARL locality, enabling better-dimensionality management through a novel theoretical framework and spectral guarantee conditions.

Abstract: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^π$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($Π(π)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $Π(π)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $ρ(E^{\mathrm{s}}+E^{\mathrm{a}}Π(π)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.

### [213] [Early-Warning Signals of Grokking via Loss-Landscape Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16967)
*Yongzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies the 'commutator defect', a measure of non-commuting gradient updates, as a robust and universal early predictor of grokking (delayed generalization) across different sequence tasks and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the mechanism of low-dimensional execution manifolds linked to grokking in modular arithmetic extends to other domains, and identify universal precursors to delayed generalization.

Method: The authors studied two sequence-learning tasks (SCAN and Dyck-1) and analyzed their curvature (commutator defect) and gradient flow properties. They conducted causal interventions to test mechanistic roles and examined lead times and impacts of amplifying or suppressing non-commutativity.

Result: The commutator defect increases well before generalization, behaves similarly across tasks, and its amplification accelerates grokking while suppression delays or prevents it. This holds consistent across modular arithmetic, SCAN, and Dyck.

Conclusion: Commutator defect is an architecture-independent, causally verified early-warning signal for delayed generalization, providing insights into the mechanisms of grokking across multiple task types.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after prolonged training -- has been linked to confinement on low-dimensional execution manifolds in modular arithmetic. Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.

*Zachary Coalson,Beth Sohler,Aiden Gabriel,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the weakness in current LLM alignment where refusal mechanisms fail-open, leading to unsafe behavior under certain attacks. It proposes fail-closed alignment for more robust safety and introduces a progressive framework to implement this principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the issue in LLM alignment where prompt-based jailbreaks can suppress refusal mechanisms, leading to unsafe outputs. Improving robustness in refusal mechanisms is critical for LLM safety.

Method: The method involves a progressive alignment framework, iteratively identifying and ablating refusal directions in the model to force the development of independent, redundant refusal pathways.

Result: Using the proposed method, the model achieves improved robustness against four jailbreak attacks, reduces over-refusals, maintains generation quality, and performs with low computational overhead.

Conclusion: Fail-closed alignment is a robust approach for LLM safety, offering effective refusal mechanisms resilient to prompt-based attacks by ensuring redundancy and independence in safety pathways.

Abstract: We identify a structural weakness in current large language model (LLM) alignment: modern refusal mechanisms are fail-open. While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.

*Leo Marchyok,Zachary Coalson,Sungho Keum,Sooel Son,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniLeak framework uncovers directions in language models that amplify PII leakage without degrading text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address privacy risks like PII leakage in language models by exploring hidden representations.

Method: Developed UniLeak—a framework that identifies latent activation directions related to PII generation through self-generated text analysis, without needing training data or groundtruth PII.

Result: UniLeak successfully amplifies PII leakage in various models and datasets more effectively than existing prompt-based methods.

Conclusion: This study advances understanding of PII leakage mechanisms and offers a framework for both enhancing and mitigating privacy risks.

Abstract: Modern language models exhibit rich internal structure, yet little is known about how privacy-sensitive behaviors, such as personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, are represented and modulated within their hidden states. We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation.

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-path speculative decoding to speed up sampling, evaluates verification strategies, and introduces delayed tree expansion and a neural selector to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the multi-path speculative decoding process by addressing performance gaps in verification strategies.

Method: A systematic evaluation of verification techniques across various setups and the introduction of delayed tree expansion and a dynamic neural selector to refine sampling processes.

Result: Traversal Verification dominates prior strategies, but with delayed tree expansion and a neural selector, optimal-transport-based methods surpass previous benchmarks, achieving a 5% improvement in average throughput.

Conclusion: The study provides novel insights and methods that enhance multi-path speculative decoding, improving efficiencies with meaningful contributions like delayed tree expansion and a neural selector for context-adaptive decisions.

Abstract: Multi-path speculative decoding accelerates lossless sampling from a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a draft tree of tokens, and then applies a verification algorithm that accepts a subset of these. While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Action Graph Policies (AGP) for better coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving higher success in both theoretical and empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decentralized decision-making in MARL by addressing the need for agents to take compatible actions under constraints, improving synchronization and overall cooperation.

Method: Introduces a novel method called Action Graph Policies (AGP), which constructs 'coordination contexts' that consider dependencies among agents' action choices. AGP improves joint policy expressiveness and action coordination.

Result: AGP achieved 80-95% success in coordination tasks with partial observability and penalties, surpassing other MARL methods that reached only 10-25%. It also outperformed baselines in various multi-agent environments.

Conclusion: AGP improves multi-agent cooperation by enabling better action coordination, offering significant theoretical advantages and robust empirical results in MARL scenarios.

Abstract: Coordinating actions is the most fundamental form of cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\%. We further demonstrate that AGP consistently outperforms these baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework that combines pathwise and Malliavin gradient estimators, achieving reduced variance in stochastic gradient estimation with theoretical guarantees and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between pathwise and score-function gradient estimators, leveraging their underlying connection to improve stochastic gradient estimation techniques.

Method: The paper derives a hybrid gradient estimator by combining pathwise and Malliavin gradients based on their empirical covariance, supported by finite-sample convergence bounds.

Result: The hybrid estimator reduces variance by up to 35% in synthetic problems and 9% in VAEs with CIFAR-10. However, challenges arise in non-stationary optimization landscapes during policy gradient experiments.

Conclusion: Mallavin calculus provides a unified framework for stochastic gradient estimation, offering clear guidance on the advantages and limitations of hybrid approaches.

Abstract: We establish a rigorous connection between pathwise (reparameterization) and score-function (Malliavin) gradient estimators by showing that both arise from the Malliavin integration-by-parts identity. Building on this equivalence, we introduce a unified and variance-aware hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure. The resulting formulation provides a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation and achieves minimum variance among all unbiased linear combinations, with closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds. We demonstrate 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Exploratory policy gradient experiments reveal that non-stationary optimization landscapes present challenges for the hybrid approach, highlighting important directions for future work. Overall, this work positions Malliavin calculus as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide tangible benefits and when they face inherent limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO) to enhance rollout efficiency in language model reasoning, using correctness-aware signals to reduce unnecessary deliberation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues with inefficiency and overthinking in language model reasoning, caused by extended deliberation relative to sampled trajectories.

Method: The WS-GRPO trains a preference model using correctness-aware signals derived from terminal rewards, providing prefix-level guidance for when to continue or stop reasoning.

Result: WS-GRPO reduces rollout length while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to conventional GRPO benchmarks.

Conclusion: WS-GRPO improves efficiency in reasoning by supplying preference-based guidance, minimizing redundant processes without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.

Method: The methods include using In-Context Learning for automating pipeline tasks and introducing improvements to tensor decomposition models for analyzing heterogeneous data.

Result: The proposed AI-enhanced pipeline showed superior performance compared to standard practices and traditional ML baselines, with validated discoveries in the context of fear generalization in mice.

Conclusion: This AI-driven method streamlines data analysis, facilitating effective discovery for domain experts while maintaining high performance and usability.

Abstract: Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of "In-Context Learning" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.

### [222] [Forecasting Anomaly Precursors via Uncertainty-Aware Time-Series Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17028)
*Hyeongwon Kang,Jinwoo Park,Seunghun Han,Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FATE, a novel unsupervised framework for early anomaly detection in time-series data using ensemble uncertainty and proposes a new evaluation metric, PTaPR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods in time-series data are limited to post-anomaly detection and lack proactive early warning capabilities, which are crucial in domains like industrial operations and cybersecurity.

Method: FATE leverages a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models to quantify predictive uncertainty for signaling potential anomalies, alongside introducing the PTaPR metric to evaluate early anomaly detection capabilities holistically.

Result: FATE demonstrated a 19.9-point improvement in PTaPR AUC and a 20.02-point improvement in early detection F1 scores on five real-world benchmark datasets, outperforming existing baselines without requiring anomaly labels.

Conclusion: The proposed FATE framework effectively and practically detects early warning signs of anomalies in real-world time series, proving its value in proactive anomaly detection.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH) for embedding tables in recommendation systems, eliminating collisions and improving feature learning via linear probing and efficient resource management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of degraded performance in large-scale recommendation systems caused by embedding table collisions using traditional hash-based indexing.

Method: MPZCH leverages linear probing, auxiliary tensors, CUDA kernels, configurable probing, and active eviction policies to eliminate collisions and improve embedding freshness.

Result: Online experiments show MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings, enhanced item embedding quality, and comparable efficiency in training and inference.

Conclusion: MPZCH improves recommendation system performance by eliminating embedding collisions while maintaining production-scale efficiency, and it is available in the open-source TorchRec library for community use.

Abstract: Embedding tables are critical components of large-scale recommendation systems, facilitating the efficient mapping of high-cardinality categorical features into dense vector representations. However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality. The solution has been released within the open-source TorchRec library for the broader community.

### [224] [Sign Lock-In: Randomly Initialized Weight Signs Persist and Bottleneck Sub-Bit Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17063)
*Akira Sakai,Yuma Ichikawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores sub-bit model compression by analyzing weight sign flips in neural networks, proposes sign lock-in theory to explain the randomness, and introduces techniques to greatly reduce sign flips with minimal performance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of sign bit storage in sub-bit model compression and understand the behavior of learned weight signs in neural networks.

Method: The authors develop sign lock-in theory, employing a stopping-time analysis to model weight sign flips caused by near-zero boundary crossings under stochastic gradient descent (SGD). They also propose a gap-based initialization and outward-drift regularizer to stabilize signs.

Result: The proposed techniques reduced the sign flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$, with only a marginal impact on model performance, indicated by about a one-point increase in perplexity.

Conclusion: Sign lock-in theory explains the randomness of weight signs as inherited from initialization rather than learned behavior, and targeted techniques effectively minimize sign flips while maintaining compression efficiency.

Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.

TL;DR: This study develops a preference-based multi-objective AI framework to align therapeutic outcomes in mental health care, achieving better balances in empathy and safety compared to single-objective models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve AI-assisted mental health care due to limited access caused by workforce shortages and cost constraints while addressing shortcomings in current AI alignment methods that fail to adequately balance patient preferences and clinical safety.

Method: The authors surveyed 335 individuals with mental health experience to collect therapeutic preferences and implemented direct preference optimization to train reward models for six therapeutic criteria, comparing multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, fine-tuning, and parameter merging.

Result: The multi-objective direct preference optimization approach delivers superior balance across criteria like empathy (77.6%) and safety (62.6%) compared to single-objective models, while therapeutic standards surpass general communication standards by 17.2%. Clinician evaluations favor this framework.

Conclusion: The multi-objective alignment framework provides a promising solution for incorporating patient preferences and clinical safety in AI systems for mental health support, as demonstrated by its superior performance and clinician approval.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STDSH-MARL, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for optimizing multimodal traffic signal control in corridor networks, improving public transportation priority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal and public transportation-oriented traffic signal control, addressing the limitations of vehicle-centric performance in corridor networks.

Method: STDSH-MARL employs a spatio-temporal dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism with centralized training and decentralized execution. It incorporates a hybrid discrete action space to determine signal phase and green duration.

Result: Experiments across five traffic scenarios confirm STDSH-MARL's superior multimodal and public transportation performance over existing methods. Temporal hyperedges significantly drive the observed performance gains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances adaptive signal timing decisions, prioritizing multimodal and public transportation efficiency in corridor networks.

Abstract: Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of how graph neural networks struggle with structural noise and non-homophilous graph topologies, aiming to improve robustness and accuracy in such situations.

Method: The framework, AdvSynGNN, incorporates multi-resolution structural synthesis, contrastive learning, a transformer backbone with attention modulated by topological signals, adversarial propagation with generative connectivity adjustments, and residual label refinement for stability.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the proposed framework effectively enhances predictive accuracy across diverse graph types while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: AdvSynGNN provides a practical and robust solution for deploying graph neural networks in complex, large-scale graph structures, improving their reliability and accuracy in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Graph neural networks frequently encounter significant performance degradation when confronted with structural noise or non-homophilous topologies. To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two optimizers, NAMO and NAMO-D, combining orthogonalized momentum with norm-based noise adaptation, demonstrating improved performance over AdamW and Muon in GPT-2 training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance optimization stability and effectiveness in stochastic settings by integrating orthogonalized momentum with adaptive techniques like those in Adam.

Method: Develop two optimizers, NAMO and NAMO-D, leveraging orthogonalized momentum and norm-based noise adaptation. NAMO uses a single adaptive stepsize while NAMO-D applies a diagonal matrix for finer neuron-wise adaptation.

Result: NAMO and NAMO-D perform better than baseline optimizers AdamW and Muon, especially in pretraining GPT-2, with NAMO-D achieving further improvements via a clamping hyperparameter.

Conclusion: NAMO and NAMO-D provide principled approaches to optimization, ensuring convergence with improved handling of noise and stability in stochastic environments. NAMO-D offers the best results due to added flexibility in balancing update direction conditioning and noise adaptation.

Abstract: Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.

*Haoyu Wang,Zhuo Huang,Xiaolong Wang,Bo Han,Zhiwei Lin,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the challenges in balancing effective data removal with preserving model performance and introduces Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), leveraging large language models and a unique positive-negative noise approach for more precise unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing necessity to uphold the 'Right to be Forgotten' in AI applications demands effective Machine Unlearning solutions as models often retain target data's influence after training.

Method: The study proposes MeGU, which uses Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to guide unlearning through concept-aware realignment, alongside innovative noise perturbation techniques to disentangle and adjust feature representations.

Result: MeGU facilitates selective forgetting of target data influences, effectively resolving under-unlearning and over-unlearning problems, while preserving shared semantic structures.

Conclusion: Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU) advances unlearning techniques by addressing entanglement of semantic features, efficiently enabling controlled erasure of target data while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the "Right to be Forgotten" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates diffusion models for generative AI tasks, emphasizing their potential for stochastic closure models while presenting a faster flow matching method in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sampling speed and efficiency of diffusion models for generating stochastic closure models in complex dynamical systems.

Method: Utilized flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space with regularization methods to analyze and maintain the fidelity of stochastic closure models.

Result: Demonstrated single-step sampling up to 100 times faster than diffusion approaches, preserving critical topological information and improving model performance with limited training data.

Conclusion: Flow matching in latent spaces with regularization is efficient for learning stochastic closure models, offering faster sampling, physical fidelity, and reduced data requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores task locality radius and its alignment with graph neural network depths for schema-level predictions, revealing the importance of proper depth-radius alignment for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the actual necessity and impact of multi-hop structural reasoning in tasks like foreign key discovery and schema-level predictions when using graph neural networks.

Method: Introduced 'locality radius' as a formal measure of structural neighborhood required for predictions and conducted empirical studies across diverse tasks with multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks.

Result: The study observed consistent evidence of a bias-radius alignment effect where task performance depends on proper alignment between task locality radius and GNN architectural depth.

Conclusion: Task performance for schema-level predictions improves when the GNN architectural depth aligns well with the task's locality radius.

Abstract: Foreign key discovery and related schema-level prediction tasks are often modeled using graph neural networks (GNNs), implicitly assuming that relational inductive bias improves performance. However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLoRG, a framework for federated fine-tuning of large language models using a single low-rank matrix, reducing errors and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are challenges in federated fine-tuning of large language models using current techniques, such as errors from aggregating separate low-rank matrices and decomposition drift.

Method: The FLoRG framework uses a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix. It employs Procrustes alignment to minimize errors and drift during federated learning.

Result: FLoRG achieves superior task accuracy and reduces communication overhead by up to 2041x, outperforming five state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FLoRG offers an efficient and accurate solution for federated fine-tuning of LLMs, providing theoretical robustness and practical gains.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\times$.

Motivation: Address the challenges of operationalizing ML models efficiently while ensuring scalability, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability to industrial tasks like HS code prediction.

Method: Utilizes serverless architecture and event-driven pipelines, employing custom embedding encoders and various deep learning architectures to automate the ML lifecycle, including monitoring and retraining.

Result: Achieved 98% accuracy with a Text-CNN model for HS code prediction, ensuring scalability, predictability, and cost-efficiency in production scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a replicable model for applying serverless MLOps in industrial applications, balancing performance, cost, and scalability with extensibility to advanced architectures like transformers or LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a serverless MLOps framework orchestrating the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion, training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining to using event-driven pipelines and managed services. The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes. This work provides a replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics.

TL;DR: The study introduces i-PhysGaussian, a framework coupling 3D Gaussian Splatting with implicit Material Point Method to improve physical simulation accuracy and stability under complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulators struggle with step-time sensitivity and rapid accuracy degradation in high-stiffness or quasi-static scenarios.

Method: The framework employs implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver for resolving states, minimizing sensitivity to time-step and ensuring physical consistency.

Result: i-PhysGaussian achieves stability with 20x larger time steps compared to explicit methods, maintaining structural and motion accuracy under complex dynamics.

Conclusion: The study successfully overcomes the limitations of explicit methods, enhancing simulation robustness and reliability in intricate physical scenarios.

Abstract: Physical simulation predicts future states of objects based on material properties and external loads, enabling blueprints for both Industry and Engineering to conduct risk management. Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver. This formulation significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency. Our results demonstrate that i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion even in complex dynamic transitions.

*Xihao Piao,Zheng Chen,Lingwei Zhu,Yushun Dong,Yasuko Matsubara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method, TIFO, for addressing distribution shifts in nonstationary time series forecasting by leveraging frequency-based stationarity-aware weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting methods struggle with distribution shifts in nonstationary time series data caused by differences in training and test distributions. Existing approaches do not adequately account for the time-evolving structure and complex temporal patterns.

Method: The paper introduces Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns weights over the frequency spectrum of the entire dataset to highlight stationary and suppress non-stationary components, using insights from the Fourier transform.

Result: TIFO demonstrated substantial improvements in forecasting performance, achieving 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings. It significantly reduces average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset by 33.3% and 55.3%, while also cutting computational costs by 60%-70%.

Conclusion: TIFO effectively handles distribution shifts in time series forecasting and offers significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Its plug-and-play nature ensures seamless integration into diverse forecasting models.

Abstract: Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.

*Jonathan Heek,Emiel Hoogeboom,Thomas Mensink,Tim Salimans*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified Latents (UL) introduces a framework combining a diffusion prior and decoder to achieve efficient and high-performing latent representation learning for visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for efficient, high-quality latent representation learning methods that balance reconstruction quality and computational efficiency for complex visual tasks.

Method: The Unified Latents (UL) framework employs a diffusion prior to regularize latent representations and links encoder output noise to the prior’s minimum noise level. This design simplifies training and ensures a tight upper bound on latent bitrate.

Result: The approach achieves competitive results on ImageNet-512 with a FID of 1.4 and high PSNR for reconstruction quality, while requiring fewer training FLOPs compared to other diffusion latent models. On Kinetics-600, it sets a new state-of-the-art FVD of 1.3.

Conclusion: UL demonstrates that combining a diffusion regularized prior and decoder can lead to computationally efficient solutions with state-of-the-art performance in latent representation learning.

Abstract: We present Unified Latents (UL), a framework for learning latent representations that are jointly regularized by a diffusion prior and decoded by a diffusion model. By linking the encoder's output noise to the prior's minimum noise level, we obtain a simple training objective that provides a tight upper bound on the latent bitrate. On ImageNet-512, our approach achieves competitive FID of 1.4, with high reconstruction quality (PSNR) while requiring fewer training FLOPs than models trained on Stable Diffusion latents. On Kinetics-600, we set a new state-of-the-art FVD of 1.3.

*Linwei Zhai,Han Ding,Mingzhi Lin,Cui Zhao,Fei Wang,Ge Wang,Wang Zhi,Wei Xi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces VP-VAE, which decouples representation learning from codebook training in VQ-VAEs by employing structured perturbations instead of explicit codebooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAEs face instability and codebook collapse due to the coupling between representation learning and discrete codebook optimization.

Method: VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with scale-adaptive latent perturbations using Metropolis--Hastings sampling, removing explicit codebook training, while FSP provides a lightweight approach for fixed quantizers.

Result: The proposed VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity, balance token usage, and avoid training instability common in traditional VQ-VAEs.

Conclusion: VP-VAE and FSP present a robust alternative to traditional VQ-VAEs, addressing codebook-related issues effectively.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers propose a machine learning-based framework using carotid ultrasound videos to assess cardiovascular risk, demonstrating improved prognostic insights and outperforming conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality globally, but early risk detection remains inadequate due to current diagnostics lacking sensitivity. Carotid ultrasound holds untapped prognostic potential.

Method: The paper develops a machine learning framework that uses hypertension as a weak proxy label to extract biologically plausible and interpretable vascular damage features from carotid ultrasound videos.

Result: The approach stratifies individuals into high-risk categories for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, showing superior performance compared to conventional risk models like SCORE2.

Conclusion: Routine carotid ultrasound contains significant untapped prognostic information, and their ML framework offers a scalable, non-invasive solution for personalized cardiovascular risk assessments, enabling enhanced prevention strategies.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.

*Tong Guan,Sheng Pan,Johan Barthelemy,Zhao Li,Yujun Cai,Cesare Alippi,Ming Jin,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents TimeOmni-VL, a framework to unify time series understanding and generation by converting data between time series and images and using understanding capabilities to guide generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the divide in time series modeling, where generative models lack semantic depth and understanding models fail in numerical fidelity.

Method: TimeOmni-VL relies on two innovations: fidelity-preserving bidirectional mappings between time series and images, and understanding-guided generation via the TSUMM-Suite dataset.

Result: The framework improves both semantic understanding and numerical generation, as confirmed by experiments.

Conclusion: TimeOmni-VL sets a new standard in multimodal time series modeling by offering a unified approach that enhances both understanding and generation.

Abstract: Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.

### [240] [Powering Up Zeroth-Order Training via Subspace Gradient Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17155)
*Yicheng Lang,Changsheng Wang,Yihua Zhang,Mingyi Hong,Zheng Zhang,Wotao Yin,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZO-Muon, a method to improve zeroth-order optimization by applying subspace gradient orthogonalization, enhancing model fine-tuning efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance zeroth-order optimization, which avoids backpropagation and relies on gradient estimation, by tackling its challenge of balancing accuracy and query efficiency.

Method: The method integrates two techniques: a subspace projection to reduce gradient estimation variance and Muon-style spectral optimization to refine noisy gradients, forming the ZO-Muon algorithm.

Result: ZO-Muon accelerates model convergence and outperforms the MeZO baseline in efficiency and accuracy, requiring fewer queries and achieving substantial performance improvements on LLMs and ViTs.

Conclusion: The ZO-Muon framework unifies optimization principles to address challenges in zeroth-order optimization, proving efficient for large-scale model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a gradient-free alternative to first-order (FO) methods by estimating gradients via finite differences of function evaluations, and has recently emerged as a memory-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale models by avoiding backpropagation. However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how attention mechanisms in machine learning models differ in their performance on simple function prediction tasks.

Method: Empirical evaluation of model architectures (transformers and linear attention models) on metrics such as MSE, convergence, generalization, and the effect of model depth on ICL.

Result: Findings reveal both similarities and limitations of linear attention compared to quadratic attention in ICL performance.

Conclusion: Linear attention has certain limitations relative to quadratic attention in linear regression tasks, highlighting opportunities for improvement in attention mechanism design for ICL.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that transformers and linear attention models can perform in-context learning (ICL) on simple function classes, such as linear regression. In this paper, we empirically study how these two attention mechanisms differ in their ICL behavior on the canonical linear-regression task of Garg et al. We evaluate learning quality (MSE), convergence, and generalization behavior of each architecture. We also analyze how increasing model depth affects ICL performance. Our results illustrate both the similarities and limitations of linear attention relative to quadratic attention in this setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a curriculum-based continual learning framework to address robust control problems in nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple uncertainties, demonstrating promising results in designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing nonlinear dynamics and operating condition uncertainties in robust mechanical system control, improving learning efficiency and overcoming sub-optimality in traditional solutions.

Method: The paper proposes decomposing complex control tasks with multiple uncertainties into sequential tasks via continual learning. It combines deep reinforcement learning with a model-based controller to ensure efficient and stable policy updates, while also preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The proposed framework successfully develops robust control policies with enhanced learning efficiency. It demonstrates effective performance in an industrial application of active vibration control for automotive powertrains, ensuring successful sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The study concludes that curriculum-based continual learning, integrated with residual learning from a model-based controller, is a practical and effective solution for robust control under multiple uncertainties, particularly in industrial contexts.

Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: The paper presents M-Attack-V2, a modular upgrade that enhances the effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through gradient-denoising techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior transfer-based attack methods struggle with high-gradient variance and instability due to ViT sensitivity and structural mismatches in multimodal systems.

Method: Introduced gradient-denoising techniques such as Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA), Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA), Patch Momentum, and a patch-size ensemble to improve transfer-based attacks.

Result: M-Attack-V2 significantly increased the success rate for black-box adversarial attacks, surpassing prior methods, with improvements including 8% to 30% on Claude-4.0 and 98% to 100% on GPT-5.

Conclusion: The proposed M-Attack-V2 framework is a simple but effective enhancement that addresses challenges in transfer-based black-box attacks against advanced LVLMs, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome significant limitations in existing GPU implementations of SoftDTW, particularly sequence-length constraints, numerical instability in the backward pass, and excessive GPU memory usage.

Method: The authors implemented tiled anti-diagonal kernel execution, a log-space backward pass, and a fused distance-computation mode to address the identified limitations.

Result: The proposed methods eliminate sequence-length constraints, prevent floating-point overflow, and reduce memory usage by up to 98%.

Conclusion: Softdtw-cuda-torch is a robust and efficient GPU library for SoftDTW, enabling arbitrary sequence lengths, memory efficiency, and full integration with PyTorch autograd. The library is freely available.

Abstract: We present softdtw-cuda-torch, an open-source PyTorch library for computing Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) on GPUs. Our implementation addresses three key limitations of existing GPU implementations of SoftDTW: a hard sequence-length cap of 1024, numerical instability in the backward pass for small smoothing parameters, and excessive GPU memory consumption from materializing pairwise distance tensors. We introduce (1) tiled anti-diagonal kernel execution that removes the sequence-length constraint, (2) a log-space back-ward pass that prevents floating-point overflow, and (3) a fused distance-computation mode that eliminates the O(BN M ) intermediate distance tensor, achieving up to 98% memory reduction compared to prior work. The library supports arbitrary sequence lengths, full PyTorch autograd integration, and Soft-DTW Barycenter computation. Code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/sdtw-cuda-torch.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CounterFlowNet, a generative approach for counterfactual explanations in AI models, tackling key challenges by ensuring sparsity, validity, and user constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current counterfactual explanation methods in terms of sparsity, compatibility with heterogeneous features, and adherence to user-defined constraints.

Method: They propose CounterFlowNet, using conditional Generative Flow Networks to sequentially modify features, ensuring minimal edits while accommodating both continuous and categorical data.

Result: CounterFlowNet achieves better trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity across eight datasets, while enforcing constraints without retraining.

Conclusion: CounterFlowNet provides a robust framework for generating high-quality and user-aligned counterfactual explanations, enhancing interpretability in machine learning models.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) provide human-interpretable insights into model's predictions by identifying minimal changes to input features that would alter the model's output. However, existing methods struggle to generate multiple high-quality explanations that (1) affect only a small portion of the features, (2) can be applied to tabular data with heterogeneous features, and (3) are consistent with the user-defined constraints. We propose CounterFlowNet, a generative approach that formulates CF generation as sequential feature modification using conditional Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet). CounterFlowNet is trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function that can encode key CF desiderata: validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility, encouraging high-quality explanations. The sequential formulation yields highly sparse edits, while a unified action space seamlessly supports continuous and categorical features. Moreover, actionability constraints, such as immutability and monotonicity of features, can be enforced at inference time via action masking, without retraining. Experiments on eight datasets under two evaluation protocols demonstrate that CounterFlowNet achieves superior trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity with full satisfaction of the given constraints.

TL;DR: A framework, SCOPE, addresses the poor generalization of EEG foundation models under limited subject-level supervision, achieving strong performance using structured prototypes and lightweight adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the poor generalization of EEG foundation models caused by limited subject-level supervision in clinical settings where noisy data poses challenges.

Method: SCOPE implements a two-stage pipeline: first, it constructs reliable external supervision utilizing task priors, prototypes, and confidence-aware pseudo-labels. Second, ProAdapter introduces lightweight adaptation using structured prototypes for fine-tuning EEG foundation models.

Result: SCOPE consistently performs well under label-limited, cross-subject settings across diverse EEG tasks and foundation model architectures, proving its efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: SCOPE successfully overcomes the mismatch between limited noisy supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EEG foundation models, ensuring improved generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models (EFMs) have achieved strong performance under full fine-tuning but exhibit poor generalization when subject-level supervision is limited, a common constraint in real-world clinical settings. We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings.

TL;DR: A generative model utilizing Wasserstein Autoencoders was created to control laser pulse shapes in Free-Electron Lasers, allowing for efficient exploration of beam optimization while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing the quality of electron beams in Free-Electron Lasers requires precise control of laser pulse shapes, but traditional methods using brute-force simulations are computationally expensive.

Method: The study implemented a generative modeling framework using Wasserstein Autoencoders to establish a latent space linking laser pulse shaping to beam dynamics, skipping extensive simulations.

Result: The latent space was found to be continuous, interpretable, and capable of high-fidelity pulse reconstructions and generalization to experimental data, reducing the computational burden.

Conclusion: This approach provides a cost-efficient, data-driven method to analyze and optimize beam dynamics in Free-Electron Lasers without heavily relying on expensive simulation procedures.

Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal laser pulse shape in photoinjectors of Free-Electron Lasers is a powerful lever for optimizing electron beam quality, but systematic exploration of the vast design space is limited by the cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations. We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLGT, a novel reinforcement learning framework for advancing research in extremal graph theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a systematic and optimized framework for solving extremal graph theory problems using reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors developed RLGT, a framework supporting undirected and directed graphs, loops, and multiple edge colors, allowing for efficient graph representations and modularity.

Result: RLGT provides computational optimization and paves the way for tackling problems such as Laplacian spectral radius inequalities, Ramsey numbers bounds, and Turán-type problems.

Conclusion: RLGT systematizes earlier work and offers a robust tool for future reinforcement learning applications in graph theory.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.

### [249] [The Anxiety of Influence: Bloom Filters in Transformer Attention Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17526)
*Peter Balogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how specific transformer attention heads in language models act as token membership testers, identifying repeated tokens in the context and displaying strategies resembling Bloom filters but surpassing their classical capacities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to understand if and how certain attention heads in language models actively detect repeated tokens and perform membership testing, analyzing this unique role's computational and linguistic implications.

Method: The study examines attention heads across four language models (GPT-2 variants and Pythia-160M), identifies their response to repeated tokens, and compares their behavior to Bloom filters. They use statistical analysis, capacity estimation, and controls for potential confounds to validate their findings.

Result: Three key membership-testing heads in early transformer layers were identified, exhibiting varying strategies resembling high-precision membership filters or Bloom filters. These heads are distinct from other types like induction heads and demonstrate reduced false positive rates with embedding distance.

Conclusion: These attention heads represent a distinct category focused on membership testing, coexisting with broader computational tasks within early model layers. They surpass traditional Bloom filter capabilities and highlight efficient multi-resolution context processing mechanisms in language models.

Abstract: Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.

TL;DR: This paper explores privacy amplification properties of random sampling schemes for differentially private optimization and presents efficient computation methods for privacy loss distributions, improving utility and suitability for DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in privacy parameter computations and improve utility trade-offs in privacy-preserving sampling schemes.

Method: Develops tools for efficient privacy loss accounting using Privacy Loss Distribution (PLD) across different algorithms, extending accuracy in subsampling analysis.

Result: Demonstrates that random allocation achieves privacy-utility trade-offs as good as or superior to Poisson subsampling, particularly for DP-SGD.

Conclusion: Newly developed PLD tools enhance privacy loss accounting and show that random allocation is an effective alternative for differential privacy optimization.

Abstract: We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.
  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.

*Hsin-Jung Yang,Zhanhong Jiang,Prajwal Koirala,Qisai Liu,Cody Fleming,Soumik Sarkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LexiSafe is a lexicographic offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for cyber-physical systems that prioritizes safety while ensuring task efficacy, with empirical and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for offline safe RL in cyber-physical systems where safety violations during training are intolerable and only pre-collected data is available.

Method: LexiSafe introduces two frameworks: LexiSafe-SC for single-cost offline safe RL with sample-complexity guarantees, and LexiSafe-MC for hierarchical safety requirements with multiple safety costs, both utilizing lexicographic prioritization.

Result: LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations along with improved task performance compared to existing offline baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively unifies lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, providing a practical and theoretically grounded solution for safety-critical decision-making in CPS.

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.

*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

TL;DR: This paper presents Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a framework where the set of available actions changes dynamically, and introduces a two-phase algorithm for exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scenarios where action availability changes dynamically, such as disaster response environments, and to efficiently solve multi-armed bandit problems under local constraints.

Method: The authors propose a two-phase algorithm: a lazy random walk for exploration and a navigation-commitment phase for exploitation, modeled under random graph processes (Erdős--Rényi and Edge-Markovian).

Result: They achieve sublinear regret bounds for arm selection and establish the near-optimality of the algorithm's exploration cost through theoretical bounds.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of dynamic multi-armed bandit problems, demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance for scenarios with constrained action availability.

Abstract: We introduce Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a new MAB framework where the set of available arms (or actions) can change at each round, and the available set at any time may depend on the agent's previously selected arm. We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erdős--Rényi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints. We complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical simulations, including a scenario of a robotic ground vehicle scouting a disaster-affected region.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and the problem of dataset imbalances that obscure critical minority clonotypes in immune repertoire analysis.

Method: Introduced SubQuad pipeline utilizing antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval, GPU-accelerated kernels, multimodal fusion, fairness-constrained clustering, and compact MinHash prefiltering.

Result: SubQuad demonstrated better throughput, memory efficiency, and improved accuracy in metrics like recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity on large datasets.

Conclusion: SubQuad provides a scalable and bias-conscious platform that addresses challenges in repertoire mining and supports applications like vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes. We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity. By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIGOOD, a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Out-of-Distribution graphs by combining continuous self-learning and test-time training to amplify OOD signals effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability of GNNs, this study focuses on identifying OOD graphs that deviate from training data, addressing the limitations of current methods (e.g., one-pass inference) that fail to refine predictions progressively.

Method: The proposed SIGOOD leverages prompt-enhanced graphs with an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss for self-improving iterative training. These techniques strengthen OOD signals, optimize detection accuracy, and operate without supervisory data.

Result: SIGOOD achieves high effectiveness in detecting OOD graphs and outperforms existing methods, as demonstrated on 21 diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SIGOOD provides a robust and unsupervised solution for graph OOD detection, offering reliable performance improvements, and the approach is further validated through comprehensive empirical studies.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential for Machine Learning (ML) techniques to classify the topology of closed curves (knot classification) and addresses issues related to non-topological features in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying the topology of closed curves, a central problem in low-dimensional topology, using ML given its success in complex classification tasks.

Method: The authors investigate shortcut methods employed by ML systems, specifically studying hidden non-topological features in training data generated via Molecular Dynamics. They also develop a publicly accessible dataset and code to avoid non-topological bias in classification.

Result: The paper identifies how ML models use non-topological features for classification in existing datasets and presents resources for generating more reliable and unbiased data.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust foundation for future ML approaches to knot classification, paving the way for models that address complex geometric knot challenges without reliance on incorrect features.

Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores improving linear attention, specifically simplifying and optimizing Mamba-2, resulting in near-softmax accuracy with better memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention while retaining the efficiency benefits of linear attention.

Method: They simplify Mamba-2 to its essential components (Mamba-2S), improve specific mechanisms (A-mask and hidden state order), and design a variant called 2Mamba.

Result: 2Mamba achieves nearly the same accuracy as softmax attention while being more memory efficient for long contexts, and explores surpassing softmax in certain cases.

Conclusion: 2Mamba proves that linear attention can be competitive in both accuracy and efficiency, giving insights into further innovations in attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Linear attention transformers have become a strong alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency. However, linear attention tends to be less expressive and results in reduced accuracy compared to softmax attention. To bridge the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention, we manipulate Mamba-2, a very strong linear attention variant. We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths. We also investigate elements to Mamba-2 that help surpass softmax attention accuracy. Code is provided for all our experiments

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CACTUS framework to improve feature stability and interpretability in machine learning models applied to incomplete biomedical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of robustness, interpretability, and stability in biomedical machine learning models under data perturbations like missingness, which are crucial for building trust in high-stakes clinical applications.

Method: The authors propose CACTUS, a framework combining feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and feature stability analysis, benchmarked against common models (e.g., random forests and gradient boosting) on a haematuria dataset with controlled missing data.

Result: CACTUS achieved competitive or better predictive performance compared to other methods and demonstrated higher stability of significant features when data completeness declined, showcasing its reliability in clinical-use cases.

Conclusion: CACTUS enhances machine learning trustworthiness in biomedical settings by prioritizing stable and interpretable features, offering a robust decision-support framework against data missingness.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied to biomedical data, yet their adoption in high stakes domains remains limited by poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under realistic data perturbations, such as missingness. In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support.

### [258] [MDP Planning as Policy Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17375)
*David Tolpin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formulates episodic MDP planning as Bayesian inference over policies, introducing a method to capture policy-level uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often ignore the uncertainty associated with policies in MDP planning. This paper aims to explore Bayesian methods to capture this uncertainty for better planning and decision-making.

Method: The authors adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to approximate the posterior distribution over policies. They introduce mechanisms to ensure policy consistency and handle stochastic dynamics effectively, using posterior predictive sampling for decision-making.

Result: The approach applies effectively in various scenarios, including grid worlds, Blackjack, and Academic Advising, showing qualitative and statistical behavior differences compared to Soft Actor-Critic while highlighting the benefits of policy-level uncertainty.

Conclusion: Bayesian inference over policies allows for capturing uncertainty in MDP planning, enabling improved stochastic control policies through posterior predictive sampling.

Abstract: We cast episodic Markov decision process (MDP) planning as Bayesian inference over _policies_. A policy is treated as the latent variable and is assigned an unnormalized probability of optimality that is monotone in its expected return, yielding a posterior distribution whose modes coincide with return-maximizing solutions while posterior dispersion represents uncertainty over optimal behavior. To approximate this posterior in discrete domains, we adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to inference over deterministic policies under stochastic dynamics, introducing a sweep that enforces policy consistency across revisited states and couples transition randomness across particles to avoid confounding from simulator noise. Acting is performed by posterior predictive sampling, which induces a stochastic control policy through a Thompson-sampling interpretation rather than entropy regularization. Across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising, we analyze the structure of inferred policy distributions and compare the resulting behavior to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, highlighting qualitative and statistical differences that arise from policy-level uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scenarios such as Gaussian dropout, noisy input training, privacy-preserving training, and federated learning where input data may be incomplete or corrupted, providing insights into their training guarantees.

Method: The paper employs Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis to examine the convergence behavior of two-layer ReLU networks trained with Gaussian randomly masked inputs.

Result: The results demonstrate linear convergence of the training process, with the error region being proportional to the variance of the input noise or mask.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that two-layer neural networks trained with Gaussian masked inputs can reliably converge, and the key contribution includes resolving randomness in non-linear activation analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the convergence guarantee of two-layer neural network training with Gaussian randomly masked inputs. This scenario corresponds to Gaussian dropout at the input level, or noisy input training common in sensor networks, privacy-preserving training, and federated learning, where each user may have access to partial or corrupted features. Using a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that training a two-layer ReLU network with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence up to an error region proportional to the mask's variance. A key technical contribution is resolving the randomness within the non-linear activation, a problem of independent interest.

*Gurjeet Sangra Singh,Frantzeska Lavda,Giangiacomo Mercatali,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel grey-box approach that combines incomplete physics models with generative models for learning dynamics in a simulation-free, scalable manner, outperforming prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models like flow and diffusion models lack interpretability by disregarding physics, while physics-based simulations are interpretable but may lack completeness in modeling real systems.

Method: The method integrates incomplete physics directly into a generative flow matching framework, utilizes two latent encodings for handling stochastic dynamics and unknown physics parameters, incorporates a physics-informed prior, and is adapted for second-order dynamics.

Result: The proposed grey-box method performs as well as or better than data-driven and prior grey-box approaches in experiments while maintaining the interpretability of physics-based models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between data-driven generative models and physics-based simulations, achieving both robust performance and interpretability. Code is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as flow matching and diffusion models have shown great potential in learning complex distributions and dynamical systems, but often act as black-boxes, neglecting underlying physics. In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model. Our code is available at https://github.com/DMML-Geneva/VGB-DM.

TL;DR: The study investigates how Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA) tackles feedback delays in multi-agent learning, yielding accelerated convergence rates in bilinear games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feedback delays in real-world multi-agent systems reduce performance, and the study aims to improve the convergence rates when facing delayed feedback.

Method: The paper analyzes WOGDA with extra optimism by interpreting it as an approximation of Extra Proximal Point (EPP), utilizing future reward predictions.

Result: The algorithm achieves linear convergence at significantly accelerated rates, particularly with extra optimism, outperforming standard optimism approaches.

Conclusion: Extra optimism in WOGDA effectively counteracts feedback delay impacts, proving beneficial for multi-agent systems under such conditions.

Abstract: Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel training method for neural networks using Boolean data adhering strictly to ±1 values, employing a nonconvex constraint approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of standard neural network training in exact solutions, efficient inference, and interpretability for discrete neural systems.

Method: Develop a constraint-based framework using the Reflect-Reflect-Relax (RRR) algorithm, incorporating Boolean threshold functions and enforcing sparsity through margin constraints.

Result: The method achieves exact solutions and strong generalization in tasks like multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, and logic inference, outperforming gradient-based methods.

Conclusion: Projection-based constraint satisfaction offers a robust and interpretable alternative for learning in discrete neural systems.

Abstract: We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.
  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) into dense supervision signals for better temporal credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of sparse environmental feedback and inefficient task-specific value function learning in self-evolving agents.

Method: A proposed framework, RICOL, uses retrospective in-context learning (RICL) with pretrained LLMs for temporal credit assignment and iteratively refines the policy.

Result: RICL estimates the advantage function effectively with few samples, identifying critical states. RICOL performs comparably to traditional RL algorithms but with increased sample efficiency.

Conclusion: LLMs provide great potential for improving temporal credit assignment in RL, enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability in such paradigms.

Abstract: Learning from self-sampled data and sparse environmental feedback remains a fundamental challenge in training self-evolving agents. Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRAFT is a parameter-efficient method applying Tucker tensor decomposition to transformer layers, achieving competitive performance with minimal parameter adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve parameter efficiency in fine-tuning large pre-trained transformer models by combining tensor decomposition techniques and lightweight adaptations.

Method: The method involves using Higher-Order SVD for Tucker decomposition of pre-trained attention weights stacked across layers. Adaptation matrices are then trained while freezing the Tucker factors.

Result: CRAFT showed competitive results on GLUE benchmarks using fewer parameters (41K Tucker adaptation parameters, independent of model size).

Conclusion: CRAFT bridges tensor decomposition and layer-wise adaptation techniques, presenting an efficient fine-tuning method requiring less computational overhead while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $ΔW$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new algorithm for Neural Additive Models (NAMs) that efficiently provides provably cardinally-minimal explanations for predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational infeasibility and lack of guarantees in generating minimal explanations for neural networks, especially for more interpretable models like NAMs.

Method: A novel model-specific algorithm for NAMs is proposed, leveraging logarithmic verification queries and parallelized preprocessing for efficiency.

Result: The proposed algorithm efficiently provides cardinally-minimal explanations, outperforming existing approaches in explanation size and computational time.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of generating provable minimal explanations for NAMs, offering substantial improvements over current methods in efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.
  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries
  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.
  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.
  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.

*Zachary Berger,Daniel Prakah-Asante,John Guttag,Collin M. Stultz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques the existing benchmarking practices in 12-lead ECG representation learning and suggests improvements in evaluation criteria to better align with meaningful clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability and clinical relevance of progress in ECG-related tasks, as current benchmarks focus narrowly on arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, neglecting broader clinical applications.

Method: The authors propose expanding evaluation metrics to include structural heart diseases and patient-level forecasting. They critique imbalanced multi-label evaluation practices and empirically assess ECG pre-training methods across six evaluation settings with a proposed random encoder baseline.

Result: Key findings include the lack of robustness in current conclusions about performance, the unexpected strength of random encoders, and the need for improved benchmark diversity for ECG applications.

Conclusion: Expanding benchmarks and improving evaluation methods are critical to ensuring reliable and clinically meaningful advancements in ECG representation learning.

Abstract: This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.

### [267] [MASPO: Unifying Gradient Utilization, Probability Mass, and Signal Reliability for Robust and Sample-Efficient LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17550)
*Xiaoliang Fu,Jiaye Lin,Yangyi Fang,Binbin Zheng,Chaowen Hu,Zekai Shao,Cong Qin,Lu Pan,Ke Zeng,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASPO, a framework to improve reinforcement learning for LLMs by addressing inefficiencies in existing RLVR algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms like GRPO struggle with rigid and misaligned optimization mechanisms for LLMs, causing limitations in efficiency and reliability.

Method: MASPO incorporates soft Gaussian gating for better gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter for balanced exploration, and an asymmetric risk controller for confidence-aligned updates.

Result: MASPO significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in RLVR performance, validated through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: MASPO provides a unified RLVR solution addressing previous inefficiencies, making it an effective advanced tool for optimizing LLMs.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

### [268] [Revisiting Weight Regularization for Low-Rank Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17559)
*Yaoyue Zheng,Yin Zhang,Joost van de Weijer,Gido M van de Ven,Shaoyi Du,Xuetao Zhang,Zhiqiang Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes EWC-LoRA, a parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL) method that uses weight regularization via Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to mitigate task interference in low-rank setups with pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL) by addressing the underexplored role of weight regularization techniques like EWC, which can mitigate task interference more effectively even in low-rank parameter representations.

Method: The method involves regularizing a shared low-rank update in PECL using EWC. This approach estimates parameter importance in a low-rank representation while keeping storage and inference costs constant across tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that EWC-LoRA achieves superior stability-plasticity trade-offs compared to other low-rank continual learning approaches.

Conclusion: EWC-LoRA demonstrates that weight regularization remains an effective task interference mitigation strategy in low-rank PECL setups, offering computational and memory efficiency, with broad potential for application.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

*Sofiane Ennadir,Tianze Wang,Oleg Smirnov,Sahar Asadi,Lele Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of normalization methods on Transformer-based models for time series tasks, showing that no single method works best for all scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding regarding the role and effect of normalization techniques in Transformer-based time series models.

Method: The authors develop an expressivity framework for time series representation and derive theoretical bounds for Standard and Min-Max scaling methods. They validate these findings empirically using benchmarks in classification and forecasting.

Result: The study finds that different normalization strategies significantly affect the model's representational capacity and that sometimes omitting normalization entirely performs better.

Conclusion: The results emphasize that preprocessing plays a crucial role in time series modeling and advocate for task-specific, principled normalization strategies rather than relying on standard techniques.

Abstract: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.

### [270] [Canonicalizing Multimodal Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17584)
*Sharut Gupta,Sanyam Kansal,Stefanie Jegelka,Phillip Isola,Vikas Garg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the systematic geometric relationship between embedding spaces of independently trained multimodal contrastive models (like CLIP, SigLIP, FLAVA) and discovers that this relationship can be approximated by a single orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether there is a geometric relationship between the embedding spaces of multimodal models independently trained on different distributions and architectures.

Method: They analyzed the alignment between embedding spaces by testing the hypothesis that an orthogonal map exists, connecting image and text encoders simultaneously across different models.

Result: The study confirmed that multimodal embedding spaces conform to an orthogonal map structure, aligning both image and text representations across various models and enabling theoretical proofs about the relationship.

Conclusion: The discovery of a shared orthogonal map across multimodal models facilitates backward-compatible model upgrades and has consequences for privacy and representation efficiency.

Abstract: As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\widetilde{f},\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\top Q = I$ such that $\widetilde{f}(x)\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\widetilde{g}(y)\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\langle f(x), g(y)\rangle \approx \langle \widetilde{f}(x), \widetilde{g}(y)\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

### [271] [Asymptotic Smoothing of the Lipschitz Loss Landscape in Overparameterized One-Hidden-Layer ReLU Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17596)
*Saveliy Baturin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the topology of the loss landscape of overparameterized one-layer ReLU networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the connections and energy gaps within the loss landscape of neural networks under overparameterization.

Method: Theoretical proofs for convex $L$-Lipschitz losses, asymptotic analysis on energy gap reduction, and empirical validation using datasets with Dynamic String Sampling (DSS).

Result: Theoretical results demonstrate connectedness within loss landscapes and energy gap reduction as width increases. Empirically, wider networks display smaller energy gaps on tested datasets.

Conclusion: Overparameterization leads to flatter loss landscapes and enhanced connectivity between sublevel sets, aiding optimization.

Abstract: We study the topology of the loss landscape of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks under overparameterization. On the theory side, we (i) prove that for convex $L$-Lipschitz losses with an $\ell_1$-regularized second layer, every pair of models at the same loss level can be connected by a continuous path within an arbitrarily small loss increase $ε$ (extending a known result for the quadratic loss); (ii) obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the energy gap $ε$ between local and global minima that vanishes as the width $m$ grows, implying that the landscape flattens and sublevel sets become connected in the limit. Empirically, on a synthetic Moons dataset and on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, we measure pairwise energy gaps via Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) and find that wider networks exhibit smaller gaps; in particular, a permutation test on the maximum gap yields $p_{perm}=0$, indicating a clear reduction in the barrier height.

### [272] [Stable Asynchrony: Variance-Controlled Off-Policy RL for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616)
*Luke Huang,Zhuoyang Zhang,Qinghao Hu,Shang Yang,Song Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses high-variance issues in asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithms and proposes the Variance Controlled Policy Optimization (VCPO) method, which stabilizes training and enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning (RL) with asynchronous updates faces unstable training due to high-variance gradients caused by stale rollouts. This creates challenges in applying RL effectively to complex tasks during large-scale model training.

Method: The authors introduce VCPO, a method for stabilizing policy-gradient algorithms like REINFORCE by scaling the learning rate based on effective sample size (ESS) and using a closed-form minimum-variance baseline to avoid relying on auxiliary value models.

Result: VCPO significantly improves robustness in asynchronous RL training across multiple reasoning tasks, reducing training time by 2.5x while achieving synchronous performance.

Conclusion: Explicit variance control in policy-gradient methods is critical for reliable asynchronous reinforcement learning, enabling faster and robust training for large-scale models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.

*Nathan S. de Lara,Florian Shkurti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new offline RL method called SMAC that allows seamless fine-tuning with no initial performance drop when transitioning to online algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue in offline RL where fine-tuning with online RL methods often results in immediate performance drops due to low-performance valleys between offline and online maxima.

Method: The authors propose SMAC, which regularizes the Q-function in offline RL to align with a first-order derivative equality, ensuring better continuity between offline and online RL landscapes.

Result: SMAC improved smooth transfer to online RL algorithms like SAC and TD3, reducing regret by 34-58% in 4/6 environments in D4RL tasks.

Conclusion: SMAC eliminates performance drops when fine-tuning offline RL actor-critics online, showing potential to bridge the gap between offline and online methods.

Abstract: Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.

### [274] [Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634)
*Xinghong Fu,Yanhong Li,Georgios Papaioannou,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reverso, a family of small, efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting, which outperform transformer-based models in performance-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale transformer-based models for time series forecasting are inefficient and expensive to use, highlighting the need for smaller and more efficient alternatives.

Method: The paper integrates small hybrid models that combine long convolution layers and linear RNN layers (like DeltaNet) along with data augmentation and inference strategies to build efficient time series foundation models.

Result: The proposed approach creates models that are a hundred times smaller than transformer-based ones and yet achieve comparable performance in zero-shot forecasting.

Conclusion: Efficient, smaller hybrid models, such as Reverso, can replace large-scale transformers for time series forecasting while pushing the frontier of performance-efficiency balance.

Abstract: Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.

### [275] [FAMOSE: A ReAct Approach to Automated Feature Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17641)
*Keith Burghardt,Jienan Liu,Sadman Sakib,Yuning Hao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAMOSE, an automated framework for feature engineering, utilizing the ReAct paradigm to enhance feature generation, refinement, and selection. Experiments show state-of-the-art results for regression and competitiveness in classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature engineering for tabular data is challenging and often requires domain expertise. The need exists for automated solutions to identify optimal features within a vast feature space.

Method: A novel agent framework, FAMOSE, was developed using the ReAct paradigm, integrating tools for feature exploration, refinement, selection, and evaluation. This approach utilizes iterative discovery and contextual feedback to refine results.

Result: FAMOSE outperforms existing algorithms in regression tasks (RMSE reduced by 2.0% on average) and achieves near state-of-the-art results in classification tasks, particularly excelling in datasets with over 10K instances.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that frameworks like FAMOSE can effectively automate and innovate feature engineering using an LLM-guided context approach, reducing reliance on domain expertise.

Abstract: Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-waste recycling suffers from inefficiencies in material sorting, leading to resource loss.

Conclusion: A.R.I.S. advances recycling efficiency by integrating deep learning, encouraging broader adoption and reducing environmental impact.

Abstract: Traditional electronic recycling processes suffer from significant resource loss due to inadequate material separation and identification capabilities, limiting material recovery. We present A.R.I.S. (Automated Recycling Identification System), a low-cost, portable sorter for shredded e-waste that addresses this efficiency gap. The system employs a YOLOx model to classify metals, plastics, and circuit boards in real time, achieving low inference latency with high detection accuracy. Experimental evaluation yielded 90% overall precision, 82.2% mean average precision (mAP), and 84% sortation purity. By integrating deep learning with established sorting methods, A.R.I.S. enhances material recovery efficiency and lowers barriers to advanced recycling adoption. This work complements broader initiatives in extending product life cycles, supporting trade-in and recycling programs, and reducing environmental impact across the supply chain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to ensure conversational AI improves decision-making quality without undermining human strengths, evaluated through medical diagnostics and pictorial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on conversational AI in critical decisions demands principled methods to enhance decision outcomes while ensuring human strengths are not compromised.

Method: The authors introduce principles of counterfactual harm and complementarity, formalized via user-defined rules and an algorithm that enforces these constraints during collaboration.

Result: The framework effectively maintains user-specified counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates, showing adaptability to dynamic interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: The principles of harm and complementarity act as controllable levers for improving collaborative decision-making, without the need to constrain human behavior.

Abstract: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARS, a strategy targeting ambiguous preference pairs to enhance reward model training through adaptive augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward modeling relies on costly and limited human-labeled data, creating the need for efficient data augmentation methods tailored to model challenges.

Method: MARS focuses on augmenting low-margin preference pairs with uncertainty to refine training distributions and enhance reward model robustness.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrated improved curvature of the loss function, and empirical results showed consistent performance gains using MARS compared to uniform augmentation.

Conclusion: MARS effectively addresses reward model shortcomings through focused and iterative augmentation, enhancing reliability and robustness in reward modeling.

Abstract: Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the scalability of CPU-only inference for convolutional neural networks across hardware tiers, highlighting saturation points and inefficiency in legacy systems, while modern systems showcase improvements via advanced instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing deployment of deep learning inference on CPUs in production environments and examine their scalability and limitations, particularly in hardware-constrained data centers and cost-sensitive setups.

Method: The study benchmarks ResNet models with varying batch sizes on both legacy (Intel Xeon E5-2403 v2 processor) and modern (Intel Xeon Granite Rapids) platforms, using the newly introduced GDEV-AI framework for scalability analysis.

Result: The legacy systems hit throughput saturation early due to instruction-level and memory bottlenecks, while modern CPUs with Advanced Matrix Extensions improve throughput but face performance degradation when cores are oversubscribed.

Conclusion: The research highlights hardware-specific performance bottlenecks and introduces the GDEV-AI framework, offering actionable insights for optimizing CPU-based deep learning inference and capacity planning in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: The deployment of deep learning inference in production environments continues to grow, where throughput, latency, and hardware efficiency are critical. Although specialized accelerators are increasingly adopted, many inference workloads still run on CPU-only systems, particularly in legacy data centers and cost-sensitive environments. This study investigates the scalability limits of CPU-based inference for convolutional neural networks by benchmarking ResNet models across varying batch sizes on two hardware tiers: a legacy Intel Xeon E5-2403 v2 processor and a modern Intel Xeon 6 "Granite Rapids" platform.
  Results show that legacy CPUs quickly reach throughput saturation, with limited scaling beyond small batch sizes due to instruction-level and memory constraints. In contrast, the Granite Rapids system leverages Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) to achieve substantially higher throughput. However, oversubscription beyond physical core limits introduces execution contention and tail-latency amplification, revealing a performance degradation regime in modern architectures.
  We introduce GDEV-AI, a reproducible benchmarking framework for analyzing scalability behavior and architectural saturation in CPU-based inference. By establishing a vendor-neutral baseline, this work provides empirical insight into performance bottlenecks and informs capacity planning in heterogeneous data center environments.

TL;DR: This paper explores improving programming productivity and reducing errors through high-quality documentation, focusing on Haskell functions via an easy-hard-split formal strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming is inherently challenging, prone to errors, and requires effective code reuse, emphasizing the need for better software library documentation.

Method: Analyzing Haskell functions from Hackage and comparing their documentation quality with similar functions in other languages using the easy-hard-split strategy.

Result: The strategy demonstrates clear and effective conceptual design in functional programming, improving documentation quality and usability.

Conclusion: The easy-hard-split formal strategy is beneficial for enhancing documentation clarity in functional programming and can be applied broadly to program analysis and synthesis.

Abstract: Since its birth as a new scientific body of knowledge in the late 1950s, computer programming has become a fundamental skill needed in many other disciplines. However, programming is not easy, it is prone to errors and code re-use is key for productivity. This calls for high-quality documentation in software libraries, which is quite often not the case. Taking a few Haskell functions available from the Hackage repository as case-studies, and comparing their descriptions with similar functions in other languages, this paper shows how clarity and good conceptual design can be achieved by following a so-called easy-hard-split formal strategy that is quite general and productive, even if used informally. This strategy is easy to use in functional programming and can be applied to both program analysis and synthesis.

### [281] [A Reversible Semantics for Janus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16913)
*Ivan Lanese,Germán Vidal*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper develops a reversible small-step semantics for the programming language Janus, ensuring equivalent functionality with enhanced reversibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reversibility in Janus’ small-step semantics, which hinders debugging and its extension for concurrency.

Method: The authors propose a novel semantics that utilizes a "program counter," enabling reversible execution of Janus programs.

Result: The new small-step semantics adheres to reversibility principles, such as the Loop Lemma, and retains equivalence to the original semantics.

Conclusion: This work successfully redefines Janus’ semantics, ensuring both forward and backward execution while preserving its original intent.

Abstract: Janus is a paradigmatic example of reversible programming language. Indeed, Janus programs can be executed backwards as well as forwards. However, its small-step semantics (useful, e.g., for debugging or as a basis for extensions with concurrency primitives) is not reversible, since it loses information while computing forwards. E.g., it does not satisfy the Loop Lemma, stating that any reduction has an inverse, a main property of reversibility in process calculi, where small-step semantics is commonly used. We present here a novel small-step semantics which is actually reversible, while remaining equivalent to the previous one. It involves the non-trivial challenge of defining a semantics based on a "program counter" for a high-level programming language.

### [282] [Mason: Type- and Name-Guided Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16981)
*Jasper Geer,Fox Huston,Jeffrey S. Foster*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mason, a tool that automates the addition of design patterns into object-oriented programs, reducing boilerplate coding requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the tedious and repetitive coding required to implement design patterns, which often distracts programmers from more critical tasks.

Method: The proposed tool, Mason, uses a type- and name-guided synthesis technique leveraging typing constraints and program transformations. It also employs non-local backtracking and syntactic pattern restrictions to refine its approach.

Result: Mason shows strong performance in benchmarks by successfully adding design patterns. Its extensions further improve performance, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Mason demonstrates a significant advancement in automating the insertion of design patterns into object-oriented programs, enhancing synthesis efficiency and productivity.

Abstract: Object-oriented programs tend to be written using many common coding idioms, such as those captured by design patterns. While design patterns are useful, implementing them is often tedious and repetitive, requiring boilerplate code that distracts the programmer from more essential details. In this paper, we introduce Mason, a tool that synthesizes object-oriented programs from partial program pieces, and we apply it to automatically insert design patterns into programs. At the core of Mason is a novel technique we call type- and name-guided synthesis, in which an enumerative solver traverses a partial program to generate typing constraints; discharges constraints via program transformations guided by the names of constrained types and members; and backtracks when a constraint is violated or a candidate program fails unit tests. We also introduce two extensions to Mason: a non-local backtracking heuristic that uses execution traces, and a language of patterns that impose syntactic restrictions on missing names. We evaluate Mason on a suite of benchmarks to which Mason must add various well-known design patterns implemented as a library of program pieces. We find that Mason performs well when very few candidate programs satisfy its typing constraints and that our extensions can improve Mason's performance significantly when this is not the case. We believe that Mason takes an important step forward in synthesizing multi-class object-oriented programs using design patterns.

*Takuro Kato,Mitsuharu Morisawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method allowing autonomous forklifts to unload pallets on inclined surfaces without dragging them, using real-time tracking and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of unloading pallets on inclined surfaces without causing dragging, which can damage the pallet or surface.

Method: Uses Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm on point clouds to calculate relative positions and align the fork parallel to the inclined surface in real-time.

Result: Dynamic simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the unloading method.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effective unloading on inclined surfaces by aligning the fork with the tilt, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications like truck unloading.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control method for autonomous forklifts to unload pallets on inclined surfaces, enabling the fork to be withdrawn without dragging the pallets. The proposed method applies the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to point clouds measured from the upper region of the pallet and thereby tracks the relative position and attitude angle difference between the pallet and the fork during the unloading operation in real-time. According to the tracking result, the fork is aligned parallel to the target surface. After the fork is aligned, it is possible to complete the unloading process by withdrawing the fork along the tilt, preventing any dragging of the pallet. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through dynamic simulations and experiments using a real forklift that replicate unloading operations onto the inclined bed of a truck.

*Sina Akhbari,Mehran Mahboubkhah*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel smooth trajectory generation method for a parallel kinematic milling robot using B-spline and Quaternion interpolation, ensuring improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for precise, efficient, and smooth trajectory generation in parallel kinematic milling robots, avoiding limitations like gimbal lock and ensuring constraints in multi-agent systems.

Method: The authors integrate B-spline and Quaternion interpolation to handle position and orientation data. They use piece-wise Bezier curves to synchronize movement, optimized through sequential quadratic programming, and employ unit quaternions for robust orientation handling.

Result: The method demonstrated enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and improved computational efficiency in experiments compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is a robust solution for trajectory generation, offering significant improvements in performance and computational feasibility, especially for low-cost microcontroller implementations.

Abstract: This paper presents a smooth trajectory generation method for a four-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic milling robot. The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RRT$^η$ introduces an improved motion planning framework integrating AGM robustness for better optimization in robotic tasks with STL specifications, showcasing efficient performance on robotics systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling-based motion planning with STL suffers from inefficiency due to non-smooth optimization landscapes created by min-max robustness measures.

Method: Use the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) robustness measure, AGM robustness interval semantics, an incremental monitoring algorithm, and FPL-based satisfaction vectors for better trajectory reasoning and control synthesis.

Result: RRT$^η$ achieves robust control synthesis while preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality, significantly outperforming traditional planners in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in traditional sampling-based planners by integrating AGM and FPL approaches, enabling more efficient and robust robotic task execution.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning has emerged as a powerful approach for robotics, enabling exploration of complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces. When combined with Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a temporal logic widely used for formalizing interpretable robotic tasks, these methods can address complex spatiotemporal constraints. However, traditional approaches rely on min-max robustness measures that focus only on critical time points and subformulae, creating non-smooth optimization landscapes with sharp decision boundaries that hinder efficient tree exploration.
  We propose RRT$^η$, a sampling-based planning framework that integrates the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) robustness measure to evaluate satisfaction across all time points and subformulae. Our key contributions include: (1) AGM robustness interval semantics for reasoning about partial trajectories during tree construction, (2) an efficient incremental monitoring algorithm computing these intervals, and (3) enhanced Direction of Increasing Satisfaction vectors leveraging Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL) for principled objective composition. Our framework synthesizes dynamically feasible control sequences satisfying STL specifications with high robustness while maintaining the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of RRT$^\ast$. We validate our approach on three robotic systems. A double integrator point robot, a unicycle mobile robot, and a 7-DOF robot arm, demonstrating superior performance over traditional STL robustness-based planners in multi-constraint scenarios with limited guidance signals.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Sound of Touch,' a scalable tactile sensing technique using vibrating strings with spectral analysis for detecting contact location, force, and slip.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing over large areas is challenging due to wiring complexity, cost, and limitations in detecting fast interactions.

Method: Uses vibrating tensioned strings combined with electromagnetic excitation and contact microphones to observe spectral changes caused by contact; supported by a physics-based simulator.

Result: Achieved millimeter-scale localization, accurate force estimation, and real-time slip detection in experiments.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a scalable, lightweight, and real-time tactile sensing solution for extended robotic surfaces with grounded physics analysis and inference tools.

Abstract: Distributed tactile sensing remains difficult to scale over large areas: dense sensor arrays increase wiring, cost, and fragility, while many alternatives provide limited coverage or miss fast interaction dynamics. We present Sound of Touch, an active acoustic tactile-sensing methodology that uses vibrating tensioned strings as sensing elements. The string is continuously excited electromagnetically, and a small number of pickups (contact microphones) observe spectral changes induced by contact. From short-duration audio signals, our system estimates contact location and normal force, and detects slip. To guide design and interpret the sensing mechanism, we derive a physics-based string-vibration simulator that predicts how contact position and force shift vibration modes. Experiments demonstrate millimeter-scale localization, reliable force estimation, and real-time slip detection. Our contributions are: (i) a lightweight, scalable string-based tactile sensing hardware concept for instrumenting extended robot surfaces; (ii) a physics-grounded simulation and analysis tool for contact-induced spectral shifts; and (iii) a real-time inference pipeline that maps vibration measurements to contact state.

*EunJeong Cheon,Do Yeon Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "Walk-Along with Robots" (WawR) methodology for studying autonomous robots in public spaces by shadowing their operations. It provides insights and draws upon ethnographic practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of autonomous robots in public spaces, there is a growing need to develop appropriate methods for studying them, especially when current methodologies are insufficient for real-world, uncontrolled settings.

Method: The paper proposes the WawR methodology inspired by ethnography, which involves researchers closely observing and walking along with delivery robots as they navigate public environments.

Result: The WawR methodology provided unique insights into robots' interactions with dynamic and real-world settings, offering a richer understanding than controlled experiments or structured observational techniques.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the WawR methodology is a valuable and innovative approach to studying autonomous robots, and it calls for future exploration and discussion on methodologies to better understand robots in public spaces.

Abstract: As the presence of autonomous robots in public spaces increases-whether navigating campus walkways or neighborhood sidewalks-understanding how to carefully study these robots becomes critical. While HRI research has conducted field studies in public spaces, these are often limited to controlled experiments with prototype robots or structured observational methods, such as the Wizard of Oz technique. However, the autonomous mobile robots we encounter today, particularly delivery robots, operate beyond the control of researchers, navigating dynamic routes and unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a more deliberate approach is required. Drawing inspiration from public realm ethnography in urban studies, geography, and sociology, this paper proposes the Walk-Along with Robots (WawR) methodology. We outline the key features of this method, the steps we applied in our study, the unique insights it offers, and the ways it can be evaluated. We hope this paper stimulates further discussion on research methodologies for studying autonomous robots in public spaces.

*Kushal Kedia,Tyler Ga Wei Lum,Jeannette Bohg,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimToolReal addresses the challenges of robotic tool manipulation by training RL policies on procedurally-generated tool-like objects in simulation, achieving strong generalization without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic tool manipulation is complex and requires dexterous actions, but teleoperation data collection is difficult; sim-to-real RL offers a scalable solution without extensive manual engineering.

Method: The approach trains RL policies to manipulate randomized tool-like objects to random goal poses in simulation, emphasizing generalization rather than task-specific tuning.

Result: SimToolReal matches specialist RL policy performance, outperforms prior methods by 37%, and achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse real-world tools.

Conclusion: SimToolReal establishes a promising framework for generalized tool manipulation in robots, reducing reliance on specific task/object optimization and bridging sim-to-real challenges effectively.

Abstract: The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing autonomous driving datasets by providing a diverse, multi-route dataset that stresses autonomous driving systems in challenging traffic and weather conditions.

Method: The Boreas-RT dataset was created using advanced sensors like cameras, radar, lidar, and GNSS-INS. Data was collected on multiple routes, repeatedly traversed under varying conditions, with precise calibrations and ground truth labels provided.

Result: Benchmarking shows that many state-of-the-art algorithms underperform on Boreas-RT's challenging routes compared to simpler environments, highlighting their shortcomings.

Conclusion: Boreas-RT is a critical resource for testing and improving multi-modal algorithms for autonomous systems, with tools like a leaderboard and development kit for deeper evaluation.

Abstract: The Boreas Road Trip (Boreas-RT) dataset extends the multi-season Boreas dataset to new and diverse locations that pose challenges for modern autonomous driving algorithms. Boreas-RT comprises 60 sequences collected over 9 real-world routes, totalling 643 km of driving. Each route is traversed multiple times, enabling evaluation in identical environments under varying traffic and, in some cases, weather conditions. The data collection platform includes a 5MP FLIR Blackfly S camera, a 360 degree Navtech RAS6 Doppler-enabled spinning radar, a 128-channel 360 degree Velodyne Alpha Prime lidar, an Aeva Aeries II FMCW Doppler-enabled lidar, a Silicon Sensing DMU41 inertial measurement unit, and a Dynapar wheel encoder. Centimetre-level ground truth is provided via post-processed Applanix POS LV GNSS-INS data. The dataset includes precise extrinsic and intrinsic calibrations, a publicly available development kit, and a live leaderboard for odometry and metric localization. Benchmark results show that many state-of-the-art odometry and localization algorithms overfit to simple driving environments and degrade significantly on the more challenging Boreas-RT routes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents MALLVi, a framework for robotic manipulation using multi-agent coordination with closed-loop feedback, improving task success rates in dynamic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic task planning methods relying on large language models lack robust environmental feedback and operate in open-loop, which makes them fragile in dynamic settings.

Method: MALLVi involves a multi-agent framework using Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector agents for closed-loop task planning. A Vision Language Model assesses feedback for iterative action refinement.

Result: The experiments show that MALLVi enhances generalization and achieves higher success rates in zero-shot manipulation tasks in both simulations and real-world.

Conclusion: MALLVi’s closed-loop feedback mechanism and multi-agent coordination offer robust and adaptive robotic task planning, addressing existing system shortcomings for practical use.

Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.

*Adrian Röfer,Nick Heppert,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to learn long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks by focusing on what tasks the robot should achieve, rather than how to achieve them, using graphical object relationships derived from demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently learn long-horizon robot manipulation tasks by focusing on task goals (what should be achieved) instead of task actions (how to achieve them), addressing challenges in prior approaches that lack full temporal and interaction resolution.

Method: The method involves representing scene states with graphical object relationships, segmenting demonstrations into manipulation graphs, estimating distributions over object states, and performing object matching with pre-trained visual features for improved robustness.

Result: The proposed method achieves accurate demonstration segmentation, effectively learns from multiple demonstrations, identifies a minimal task model, and demonstrates reliable task execution in both simulation and real-robot environments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully represents long-horizon manipulation tasks, leading to robust and transferable execution across different environments. It offers a comprehensive understanding of task-level interactions from demonstrations.

Abstract: Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks efficiently is a central challenge in robot learning from demonstration. Unlike recent endeavors that focus on directly learning the task in the action domain, we focus on inferring what the robot should achieve in the task, rather than how to do so. To this end, we represent evolving scene states using a series of graphical object relationships. We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation. To improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations, we additionally perform object matching using pre-trained visual features. In extensive experiments, we evaluate our method's demonstration segmentation accuracy and the utility of learning from multiple demonstrations for finding a desired minimal task model. Finally, we deploy the fitted models both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that the resulting task representations support reliable execution across environments.

*Varun Burde,Pavel Burget,Torsten Sattler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate the functional impact of 3D reconstruction quality on robotic manipulation tasks like grasping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D reconstruction methods produce high-quality meshes, their impact on downstream robotic tasks, such as grasping or object manipulation, is not well understood, creating a gap in the correlation between geometric accuracy and practical efficacy.

Method: The authors propose a physics-based benchmark to assess how reconstructed 3D meshes and 6D pose estimations affect grasping performance, including simulations on ground-truth models and reconstructed models with pose and shape inaccuracies.

Result: The study found that reconstruction errors reduce the number of grasp pose candidates but do not significantly affect grasping performance if the pose is accurately estimated. Spatial errors dominate grasp success over other types of geometric inaccuracies.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of understanding how perception system inaccuracies, such as those in 3D reconstruction, translate into real-world robotic behaviors and manipulation outcomes, providing actionable insights for improving robot perception-manipulation integration.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots.

*Tanisha Parulekar,Ge Shi,Josh Pinskier,David Howard,Jen Jen Chung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the representation gap between rigid and soft gripper grasp synthesis by proposing a novel framework using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to map poses from rigid to soft grippers, achieving improved grasp success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasp synthesis models for rigid grippers fail to efficiently adapt to soft grippers due to their unique compliant behaviors, necessitating a data-efficient and accurate solution to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors propose a framework using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, that leverages paired rigid-soft grasp pose datasets and incorporates an object geometry-based U-Net autoencoder to map poses from rigid to soft grippers.

Result: The proposed method achieved significantly improved grasp success rates for soft grippers compared to rigid gripper models, with higher success rates for both seen and unseen objects across multiple shapes.

Conclusion: The CFM-based approach provides a scalable and generalizable solution for transferring grasp strategies from rigid to soft grippers, demonstrating effectiveness, particularly for soft robotic systems.

Abstract: A representation gap exists between grasp synthesis for rigid and soft grippers. Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems.

Result: The authors developed an effective system for simulating and controlling hybrid rigid-soft robots in AR for seamless operation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables users to efficiently interact and teleoperate hybrid robots, advancing their utility in practical tasks.

Abstract: Hybrid rigid-soft robots combine the precision of rigid manipulators with the compliance and adaptability of soft arms, offering a promising approach for versatile grasping in unstructured environments. However, coordinating hybrid robots remains challenging, due to difficulties in modeling, perception, and cross-domain kinematics. In this work, we present a novel augmented reality (AR)-based physical human-robot interaction framework that enables direct teleoperation of a hybrid rigid-soft robot for simple reaching and grasping tasks. Using an AR headset, users can interact with a simulated model of the robotic system integrated into a general-purpose physics engine, which is superimposed on the real system, allowing simulated execution prior to real-world deployment. To ensure consistent behavior between the virtual and physical robots, we introduce a real-to-simulation parameter identification pipeline that leverages the inherent geometric properties of the soft robot, enabling accurate modeling of its static and dynamic behavior as well as the control system's response.

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified coordinate-free model for fixed-wing aircraft dynamics on SO(3), enabling precise trajectory-to-input mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inverse flight dynamics often rely on local coordinates, which are prone to inaccuracies and complexity in high-dimensional systems like robotic aircraft.

Method: The authors introduce a geometric, coordinate-free approach, enforcing coordinated flight and deriving closed-form solutions for trajectory-to-input mappings for fixed-wing aircraft dynamics.

Result: The paper provides analytic expressions for flight mechanics, including bank angle and thrust-angle-of-attack, and identifies decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and apparent gravity.

Conclusion: This framework bridges aeronautical simulation and robotics modeling, offering effective tools for trajectory planning and stability analysis.

Abstract: We present a robotics-oriented, coordinate-free formulation of inverse flight dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft on SO(3). Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks.

Motivation: To enable precise and robust control of UAVs carrying suspended flexible cables in dynamics-aware applications.

Result: Simulation results show the framework's stability, efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness in controlling cable dynamics under varied operating conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates its ability to provide real-time, dynamics-aware control of UAVs with flexible payloads, with wide application potential.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for aerial manipulation of an extensible cable that combines a high-fidelity model based on partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reduced-order representation suitable for real-time control. The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the framework enables real-time, dynamics-aware control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying suspended flexible cables.

Motivation: Repeatedly navigating familiar environments causes challenges in accurate mapping and localization, critical for many autonomous tasks like driving or household robotics.

Method: The framework involves a topology-informed decision mechanism to identify low-connectivity areas, selectively activating mapping and loop closure processes, while integrating results into an existing model.

Result: Validated on datasets and real-world environments, the method reduces accumulated errors and improves global consistency significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances mapping and localization for repeated session environments, demonstrating superior performance in both theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: Operating in previously visited environments is becoming increasingly crucial for autonomous systems, with direct applications in autonomous driving, surveying, and warehouse or household robotics. This repeated exposure to observing the same areas poses significant challenges for mapping and localization -- key components for enabling any higher-level task. In this work, we propose a novel multi-session framework that builds on map-based localization, in contrast to the common practice of greedily running full SLAM sessions and trying to find correspondences between the resulting maps. Our approach incorporates a topology-informed, uncertainty-aware decision-making mechanism that analyzes the pose-graph structure to detect low-connectivity regions, selectively triggering mapping and loop closing modules. The resulting map and pose-graph are seamlessly integrated into the existing model, reducing accumulated error and enhancing global consistency. We validate our method on overlapping sequences from datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world mine-like environment.

### [298] [FRAPPE: Infusing World Modeling into Generalist Policies via Multiple Future Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17259)
*Han Zhao,Jingbo Wang,Wenxuan Song,Shuai Chen,Yang Liu,Yan Wang,Haoang Li,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'FRAPPE,' a method to improve world modeling for robots, addressing issues like overemphasis on pixel reconstruction and error accumulation in predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle limitations in current world modeling approaches: difficulty in semantic learning due to pixel-level reconstruction and error accumulation when predicting future dynamics.

Method: The method, 'FRAPPE,' involves mid-training to predict future latent representations, followed by post-training expansion to align with multiple visual foundation models in parallel.

Result: FRAPPE enhances efficiency and reduces reliance on action-labeled data, outperforming other methods in benchmarks and real-world scenarios, especially in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: FRAPPE offers a scalable, more generalizable way to improve robotic reasoning and environmental understanding, advancing performance in unseen and complex tasks.

Abstract: Enabling VLA models to predict environmental dynamics, known as world modeling, has been recognized as essential for improving robotic reasoning and generalization. However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios.

### [299] [Contact-Anchored Proprioceptive Odometry for Quadruped Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17393)
*Minxing Sun,Yao Mao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a proprioceptive state estimator for legged robots, relying solely on IMU and motor measurements, achieving significant error reduction in body pose and velocity estimation for diverse robot types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR, addressing challenges like IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing.

Method: Employ foot wrench estimation for contact selection, world-frame constraints for drift reduction, height clustering for elevation correction, and an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter for improved velocity observations.

Result: The method was validated across four quadruped platforms, achieving loop closure errors ranging from 0.1638m to 7.68m horizontally and less than 0.1m to 0.540m vertically.

Conclusion: This approach showcases its robustness with varying levels of accuracy across quadruped robot types, offering a promising avenue for camera/LiDAR-independent odometry.

Abstract: Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\sim$200\,m horizontal loop and a $\sim$15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\sim$700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a $\sim$20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a $\sim$120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a $\sim$8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. github.com/ShineMinxing/Ros2Go2Estimator.git

*Yi Zhang,Omar Faris,Chapa Sirithunge,Kai-Fung Chu,Fumiya Iida,Fulvio Forni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized, safety-conscious control framework for human-robot collaboration using Virtual Model Control, enabling deadlock-free and scalable teamwork.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an intuitive, scalable, and deadlock-free control system for human-robot collaborations, ensuring safety and flexibility for multiple agents.

Method: The framework uses Virtual Model Control to embed humans and robots in a shared virtual workspace, enforcing interaction through simulated virtual springs and dampers. A decentralized force-based stall detection mechanism resolves deadlocks via negotiation.

Result: The framework eliminates deadlocks in block placement tasks, reducing the probability of stalls from 61.2% to zero. It supports safe collaboration involving up to two humans and two robots in tests, and up to four robots in simulations, maintaining agent separation of ~20 cm.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only shapes intuitive robot behavior but also ensures safety and scalability for human-robot collaborations, achieving effective and deadlock-free teamwork.

Abstract: We present a decentralized, agent agnostic, and safety-aware control framework for human-robot collaboration based on Virtual Model Control (VMC). In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of integrating effective optical sensing solutions compatible with intricate geometries and single-material, one-step additive fabrication in soft robotics.

Method: The authors present a method involving a Y-shaped waveguide with a printed lens that distributes optical power based on deformation, using a modified acrylate-based resin for improved optical and mechanical properties.

Result: The study demonstrated precise lens design and deformation-based sensing capabilities, showing reproducibility and selective optical signal switching over multiple cycles.

Conclusion: The research established a material-to-optics workflow, enhancing soft optical sensing with lens functionalities, paving the way for advanced soft robotics applications.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing is enabling soft robots with increasingly complex geometries, creating a demand for sensing solutions that remain compatible with single-material, one-step fabrication. Optical soft sensors are attractive for monolithic printing, but their performance is often degraded by uncontrolled light propagation (ambient coupling, leakage, scattering), while common miti- gation strategies typically require multimaterial interfaces. Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles. These results establish a transferable material-to-optics workflow for soft optical sensors with lens with new functionalities for next-generation soft robots

Motivation: Current solutions for adverse weather conditions in automated vehicles have limitations, particularly in scalability, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with existing systems. The motivation is to address these limitations by developing an accessible and sustainable hardware solution.

Method: A hardware solution compatible with multiple cameras was presented, designed to enhance camera performance during rainy conditions, and was integrated with an existing Deep Learning model for evaluation.

Conclusion: This solution extends the operational capabilities of automated vehicles in adverse conditions, provides a sustainable and scalable option that reduces costs and resource use, and supports broader adoption of automated vehicle technology.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated vehicles have focused on improving perception performance under adverse weather conditions; however, research on physical hardware solutions remains limited, despite their importance for perception critical applications such as vehicle platooning. Existing approaches, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic lenses and sprays, provide only partial mitigation, while industrial protection systems imply high cost and they do not enable scalability for automotive deployment.
  To address these limitations, this paper presents a cost-effective hardware solution for rainy conditions, designed to be compatible with multiple cameras simultaneously.
  Beyond its technical contribution, the proposed solution supports sustainability goals in transportation systems. By enabling compatibility with existing camera-based sensing platforms, the system extends the operational reliability of automated vehicles without requiring additional high-cost sensors or hardware replacements. This approach reduces resource consumption, supports modular upgrades, and promotes more cost-efficient deployment of automated vehicle technologies, particularly in challenging weather conditions where system failures would otherwise lead to inefficiencies and increased emissions. The proposed system was able to increase pedestrian detection accuracy of a Deep Learning model from 8.3% to 41.6%.

*Carolina Gay,Petr Trunin,Diana Cafiso,Yuejun Xu,Majid Taghavi,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-ERA, an optically sensorized electro-ribbon actuator (ERA) for improved sensing and control by embedding soft optical waveguide sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ERAs suffer from limited precision in embedded sensing, hindering their potential for accurate control.

Method: The authors designed and embedded two soft optical waveguide sensors into the ERA and trained a classifier to distinguish eight bending states from the sensor signals.

Result: The sensing system demonstrates high accuracy and repeatability in classifying bending states, even with mismatched actuation speeds, validating the system's robustness.

Conclusion: OS-ERA overcomes ERA's longstanding limitations by enabling reliable closed-loop control through accurate and invariant sensing, paving the way for advanced practical applications.

Abstract: Electro-Ribbon Actuators (ERAs) are lightweight flexural actuators that exhibit ultrahigh displacement and fast movement. However, their embedded sensing relies on capacitive sensors with limited precision, which hinders accurate control. We introduce OS-ERA, an optically sensorized ERA that yields reliable proprioceptive information, and we focus on the design and integration of a sensing solution without affecting actuation. To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance. As a result, OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity; it is fast and repeatable, solving a longstanding bottleneck of the ERA, enabling steps toward closed-loop control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement in powered prosthetic knees, demonstrating improved walking speed and feasibility while emphasizing the importance of mass distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower limb amputations significantly impair mobility and daily activities. Existing powered prosthetic knees assist users but added weight in traditional placements affects gait mechanics and energy use. Optimizing mass distribution may address this.

Method: This exploratory study assessed the performance of a powered prosthetic knee with above-knee powertrain placement in comparison to below-knee placement. Testing included flat walking, ramps, and stairs to evaluate walking mechanics and control robustness.

Result: Above-knee placement showed improved walking speed (+9.2%) and cadence (+3.6%) for one participant while maintaining similar knee kinematics compared to below-knee placement. The control strategy remained effective across different terrains.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that above-knee powertrain placement is functionally feasible and improves certain gait parameters, highlighting the significance of mass distribution in designing powered prosthetic knees. Further research is needed to confirm and expand on these results.

Abstract: Lower limb amputation affects millions worldwide, leading to impaired mobility, reduced walking speed, and limited participation in daily and social activities. Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations.

TL;DR: RA-Nav introduces a semantic segmentation-based risk-aware navigation framework for aerial robots to handle sudden obstacle movements effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerial robot navigation fails to adapt effectively to sudden movement of static obstacles, necessitating a framework integrating semantic awareness for risk estimation.

Method: The framework implements a lightweight semantic segmentation network for obstacle categorization, risk estimation functions for obstacle types, and a risk-informed path search algorithm combined with trajectory optimization.

Result: Comparative simulations show RA-Nav improves success rates in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios and validates its effectiveness with real-world data.

Conclusion: RA-Nav offers a promising solution for safer and more efficient aerial robot navigation under dynamic obstacle environments.

Abstract: Existing aerial robot navigation systems typically plan paths around static and dynamic obstacles, but fail to adapt when a static obstacle suddenly moves. Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data.

Abstract: The ever increasing intensity and number of disasters make even more difficult the work of First Responders (FRs). Artificial intelligence and robotics solutions could facilitate their operations, compensating these difficulties. To this end, we propose a dataset for gesture-based UGV control by FRs, introducing a set of 12 commands, drawing inspiration from existing gestures used by FRs and tactical hand signals and refined after incorporating feedback from experienced FRs. Then we proceed with the data collection itself, resulting in 3312 RGBD pairs captured from 2 viewpoints and 7 distances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset especially intended for gesture-based UGV guidance by FRs. Finally we define evaluation protocols for our RGBD dataset, termed FR-GESTURE, and we perform baseline experiments, which are put forward for improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems, specifically due to computationally intensive and numerically sensitive mixed-integer programming.

Method: The method involves using hybrid zonotopes for set representation and a newly proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) as a mixed-integer programming heuristic. The approach includes piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis and extends it for planning problems.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the hybrid zonotopes result in lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations compared to existing techniques. The ADMM heuristic shows superior convergence rates when applied to planning problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves planning for hybrid systems, making it suitable for practical use, as demonstrated by applications in behavior and motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Deep-Flow is an unsupervised framework for detecting safety-critical anomalies in autonomous vehicle behavior using optimal transport and PCA-based low-rank spectral manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reliably identifying rare, high-risk scenarios in autonomous vehicle safety validation which traditional methods struggle with.

Method: Deep-Flow applies OT-CFM to model human driving behavior, constraining generation to a PCA spectral manifold, and incorporates an Early Fusion Transformer with lane-aware goal conditioning.

Result: The framework achieved a strong AUC-ROC performance and highlighted the differentiation between semantic non-compliance and kinematic danger in safety-critical events.

Conclusion: Deep-Flow offers a rigorous, numerical basis for safety validation in autonomous vehicles, enabling identification of behaviors traditional methods may miss.

Abstract: Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.

Conclusion: The method effectively enables scalable and precise real-time control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, with significant performance gains.

Abstract: The control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, requires models that faithfully capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a digital twin framework for construction QA, integrating real-time data for timely quality assessments and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address delays in QA processes in construction projects which lead to risks like rework and schedule impacts.

Method: A digital twin framework that connects various data streams for real-time, element-level QA and decision support during construction.

Result: The framework enhances early, data-informed quality assessments while retaining traditional QA processes.

Conclusion: The approach can make QA proactive and element-focused, offering a pathway to improve construction-phase decision-making.

Abstract: Quality assurance (QA) during construction often relies on inspection records and laboratory test results that become available days or weeks after work is completed. On large highway and bridge projects, this delay limits early intervention and increases the risk of rework, schedule impacts, and fragmented documentation. This study presents a construction-phase digital twin framework designed to support element-level QA and readiness-based decision making during active construction. The framework links inspection records, material production and placement data, early-age sensing, and predictive strength models to individual construction elements. By integrating these data streams, the system represents the evolving quality state of each element and supports structured release or hold decisions before standard-age test results are available. The approach does not replace established inspection and testing procedures. Instead, it supplements existing workflows by improving traceability and enabling earlier, data-informed quality assessments. Practical considerations related to data integration, contractual constraints, and implementation challenges are also discussed. The proposed framework provides a structured pathway for transitioning construction QA from delayed, document-driven review toward proactive, element-level decision support during construction.

Abstract: When assessing the quality of coding agents, predominant benchmarks focus on solving single issues on GitHub, such as SWE-Bench. In contrast, in real use, these agents solve more various and complex tasks that involve other skills such as exploring codebases, testing software, and designing architecture. In this paper, we first characterize some transferable skills that are shared across diverse tasks by decomposing trajectories into fine-grained components, and derive a set of principles for designing auxiliary training tasks to teach language models these skills. Guided by these principles, we propose a training environment, Hybrid-Gym, consisting of a set of scalable synthetic tasks, such as function localization and dependency search. Experiments show that agents trained on our synthetic tasks effectively generalize to diverse real-world tasks that are not present in training, improving a base model by 25.4% absolute gain on SWE-Bench Verified, 7.9% on SWT-Bench Verified, and 5.1% on Commit-0 Lite. Hybrid-Gym also complements datasets built for the downstream tasks (e.g., improving SWE-Play by 4.9% on SWT-Bench Verified). Code available at: https://github.com/yiqingxyq/Hybrid-Gym.

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can automate the generation of user stories from high-fidelity mockups with improved results using a Language Extended Lexicon (LEL) glossary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently generating accurate and useful user stories by combining mockups with AI-driven methods utilizing LLMs.

Method: A case study was conducted to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate user stories from high-fidelity mockups, with and without a glossary of the Language Extended Lexicon (LEL) included in the prompts.

Result: Including the LEL glossary in prompts was found to significantly enhance the accuracy and suitability of the user stories generated by the LLMs.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with LEL glossary provides an effective AI-driven approach to improving communication and automation in requirements engineering.

Abstract: User stories are one of the most widely used artifacts in the software industry to define functional requirements. In parallel, the use of high-fidelity mockups facilitates end-user participation in defining their needs. In this work, we explore how combining these techniques with large language models (LLMs) enables agile and automated generation of user stories from mockups. To this end, we present a case study that analyzes the ability of LLMs to extract user stories from high-fidelity mockups, both with and without the inclusion of a glossary of the Language Extended Lexicon (LEL) in the prompts. Our results demonstrate that incorporating the LEL significantly enhances the accuracy and suitability of the generated user stories. This approach represents a step forward in the integration of AI into requirements engineering, with the potential to improve communication between users and developers.

*Giovanni Rosa,David Moreno-Lumbreras,Raula Gaikovina Kula*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines how the Obsidian platform, a non-developer-centric ecosystem, sustains its plugin community, identifying six main plugin types and analyzing their maintenance and evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how plugin ecosystems, especially within non-developer-centric communities like Obsidian, are maintained and developed.

Method: The authors use repository mining and LLM-based topic modeling to analyze a sample of 396 plugins, identifying key themes and examining pull request activities.

Result: Six primary plugin topics were identified: dynamic editing/organization, interface/layouts, creative writing/productivity, knowledge synchronization, linking/scripts, and workflow enhancements. Pull request analysis revealed significant software evolution.

Conclusion: Even in communities not centered on software development, robust plugin ecosystems can exhibit engineering structures, prompting new research into their health and sustainability.

Abstract: The adoption of third-party libraries has become integral to modern software development, leading to large ecosystems such as PyPI, NPM, and Maven, where contributors typically share the technical expertise to sustain extensions. In communities that are not exclusively composed of developers, however, maintaining plugin ecosystems can present different challenges. In this early results paper, we study Obsidian, a knowledge--centric platform whose community is focused on writing, organization, and creativity--has built a substantial plugin ecosystem despite not being developer--centric. We investigate what kinds of plugins exist within this hybrid ecosystem and establish a foundation for understanding how they are maintained. Using repository mining and LLM-based topic modeling on a representative sample of 396 plugins, we identify six topics related to knowledge management and tooling, which is (i) dynamic editing and organization, (ii) interface and layouts, (iii) creative writing and productivity, (iv) knowledge sync solutions, (v) linking and script tools, and (vi) workflow enhancements tools. Furthermore, analysis of the Pull Requests from these plugins show that much software evolution has been performed on these ecosystem. These findings suggest that even in mixed communities, plugin ecosystems can develop recognizable engineering structures, motivating future work that highlight three different research directions with six research questions related to the health and sustainability of these non-developer ecosystems.

*Rahul Nanda,Chandra Maddila,Smriti Jha,Euna Mehnaz Khan,Matteo Paltenghi,Satish Chandra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated system named Wink to tackle misbehaviors in autonomous coding agents, improving recovery efficiency and reducing disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous coding agents often fail to follow instructions, loop endlessly, or misuse tools, disrupting workflows and requiring manual intervention.

Method: The authors propose Wink, a lightweight and asynchronous self-intervention system, to observe and correct agent misbehaviors based on a taxonomy of common errors: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures.

Result: Wink resolves 90% of misbehaviors requiring a single intervention and significantly reduces disruptions in agent performance through live A/B testing.

Conclusion: Wink improves the reliability of agentic systems, minimizes manual interventions, and enhances large-scale production environments.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being adopted in the software industry to automate complex engineering tasks. However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.
  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a predictive model to identify portions of AI-generated code likely to be deleted during code review, achieving 87.1% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency caused by AI-generated code during pull request reviews, as often reviewers must examine and delete unnecessary code.

Method: Developed a predictive model that identifies functions likely to be deleted during review, based on distinct characteristics of deletable code.

Result: The model demonstrated an AUC of 87.1%, effectively distinguishing functions likely to be removed for different reasons.

Conclusion: Predictive models can significantly streamline the review process by enabling reviewers to focus only on essential code.

Abstract: Agentic Coding, powered by autonomous agents such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor, enables developers to generate code, tests, and pull requests from natural language instructions alone. While this accelerates implementation, it produces larger volumes of code per pull request, shifting the burden from implementers to reviewers. In practice, a notable portion of AI-generated code is eventually deleted during review, yet reviewers must still examine such code before deciding to remove it. No prior work has explored methods to help reviewers efficiently identify code that will be removed.In this paper, we propose a prediction model that identifies functions likely to be deleted during PR review. Our results show that functions deleted for different reasons exhibit distinct characteristics, and our model achieves an AUC of 87.1%. These findings suggest that predictive approaches can help reviewers prioritize their efforts on essential code.

*Arjun Ashok,Nafiz Imtiaz Khan,Swati Singhvi,Stefan Stanciulescu,Zhouhao Wang,Vladimir Filkov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies the sustainability of OSS projects in foundations and proposes models to predict and improve sustainability outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of matching OSS projects with appropriate foundations and creating project-specific sustainability plans due to diverse project needs and lifecycle stages.

Method: Conducted an empirical study and quantitative analysis of OSS projects across Apache, Eclipse, OSGeo foundations and GitHub. Developed sustainability models and a triage system based on sociotechnical trace profiles to forecast project outcomes.

Result: Demonstrated that the models and triage system effectively predict project sustainability across different foundations and even for GitHub projects outside foundations. Introduced recovery strategies for failed projects.

Conclusion: Sociotechnical frameworks are valuable for predicting and enhancing software project sustainability in OSS foundations and beyond.

Abstract: Many OSS projects join foundations such as Apache, Eclipse, and OSGeo, to aid their immediate plans and improve long-term prospects by getting governance advice, incubation support, and community-building mechanisms. But foundations differ in their policies, funding models, and support strategies. Moreover, since projects joining these foundations are diverse, coming at different lifecycle stages and having different needs, it can be challenging to decide on the appropriate project-foundation match and on the project-specific plan for sustainability.
  Here, we present an empirical study and quantitative analysis of the sustainability of incubator projects in the Apache, Eclipse, and OSGeo foundations, and, additionally, of OSS projects from GitHub outside of foundations. We develop foundation-specific sustainability models and a project triage, based on projects' sociotechnical trace profiles, and demonstrate their effectiveness across the foundations. Our results show that our models with triage can effectively forecast sustainability outcomes not only within but across foundations. In addition, the generalizability of the framework allows us to apply the approach to GitHub projects outside the foundations. We complement our findings with actionable recovery strategies from previous work and apply them to case studies of failed incubator projects. Our study highlights the value of sociotechnical frameworks in characterizing and addressing software project sustainability issues.

*Yuki Takei,Toshiaki Aoki,Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study introduces 'Mutual Impact Analysis of OSS (MIAO)', a method to analyze competitive relationships among open-source software (OSS) projects and predict their development cessation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the unclear impact of competitive relationships among OSS projects on their survival, considering the risk of losing competitiveness in evolving domains like web development and deep learning.

Method: The study developed the 'MIAO' method, combining structural vector autoregressive models and impulse response functions from macroeconomic analysis, analyzing interactions in 187 OSS project groups.

Result: MIAO achieves up to 81% accuracy in identifying OSS projects ceasing development due to competitive factors and predicts cessation one year in advance with up to 77% accuracy.

Conclusion: MIAO provides valuable insights for OSS project maintainers, helping them understand OSS ecosystem dynamics and predict project outcomes effectively.

Abstract: Throughout the history of software, evolution has occurred in cycles of rise and fall driven by competition, and open-source software (OSS) is no exception. This cycle is accelerating, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as web development and deep learning. However, the impact of competitive relationships among OSS projects on their survival remains unclear, and there are risks of losing a competitive edge to rivals. To address this, this study proposes a new automated method called ``Mutual Impact Analysis of OSS (MIAO)'' to quantify these competitive relationships. The proposed method employs a structural vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions, normally used in macroeconomic analysis, to analyze the interactions among OSS projects. In an empirical analysis involving mining and analyzing 187 OSS project groups, MIAO identified projects that were forced to cease development owing to competitive influences with up to 81\% accuracy, and the resulting features supported predictive experiments that anticipate cessation one year ahead with up to 77\% accuracy. This suggests that MIAO could be a valuable tool for OSS project maintainers to understand the dynamics of OSS ecosystems and predict the rise and fall of OSS projects.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in long-context code question answering by introducing new datasets and testing variables like answer formats and irrelevant distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well LLMs handle reasoning across long code contexts and assess their robustness under different input conditions.

Method: The study introduces an extended benchmark called LongCodeBench with new COBOL and Java datasets. It evaluates models under various settings, including shuffled multiple-choice options, open-ended questions, and adversarial contexts featuring irrelevant information.

Result: Performance drops significantly in shuffled multiple-choice and open-ended questions, and the models show brittle behavior against irrelevant cues.

Conclusion: Current long-context evaluations of LLMs are insufficient, and the new benchmark provides a better foundation for evaluating code reasoning in both legacy and modern systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly assist software engineering tasks that require reasoning over long code contexts, yet their robustness under varying input conditions remains unclear. We conduct a systematic study of long-context code question answering using controlled ablations that test sensitivity to answer format, distractors, and context scale. Extending LongCodeBench Python dataset with new COBOL and Java question-answer sets, we evaluate state-of-the-art models under three settings: (i) shuffled multiple-choice options, (ii) open-ended questions and (iii) needle-in-a-haystack contexts containing relevant and adversarially irrelevant information. Results show substantial performance drops in both shuffled multiple-choice options and open-ended questions, and brittle behavior in the presence of irrelevant cues. Our findings highlight limitations of current long-context evaluations and provide a broader benchmark for assessing code reasoning in both legacy and modern systems.

### [320] [The Case for HTML First Web Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17193)
*Juho Vepsäläinen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HTML First emphasizes minimalism and prioritizes HTML in web development for conceptual simplicity and performance benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate HTML-based simplicity into web development by reducing the reliance on frameworks and embracing hypermedia.

Method: The study analyzes the benefits of shifting to HTML First principles through a case study and content-driven holotype comparisons.

Result: The approach reduces codebase size, improves maintenance, and shows performance advantages in case studies and website comparisons.

Conclusion: HTML First principles demonstrate value for developers but require further exploration, especially regarding AI-driven web development trends.

Abstract: Since its introduction in the early 90s, the web has become the largest application platform available globally. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development.

TL;DR: The paper proposes disjunction composition for combining and testing BDD transition systems while maintaining testing power, validated through symbolic semantics and an industrial case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for integrating and testing alternative system behaviors in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) while preserving the original testing power of individual scenarios.

Method: Define and formalize disjunction composition, utilizing symbolic semantics to validate its testing equivalence properties. Demonstrate its application through an industrial case study.

Result: Introduced disjunction composition, proved its equivalence properties and testing efficacy using symbolic semantics, and validated its application in a practical industrial scenario.

Conclusion: Disjunction composition is an effective method for modeling and testing integrated behaviors in BDD systems without losing the testing power of individual scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a compositional approach to model-based test generation in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). BDD is an agile methodology in which system behavior is specified through textual scenarios that, in our approach, are translated into transition systems used for model-based testing. This paper formally defines disjunction composition, to combine BDD transition systems that represent alternative system behaviors. Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved. This is proved using a symbolic semantics for BDD transition systems, with the property that the symbolic equivalence of two BDD transition systems guarantees that they fail the same test cases. Also, we demonstrate the potential of disjunction composition by applying the composition in an industrial case study.

TL;DR: The paper addresses socio-technical challenges in quantum open-source communities, focusing on community smells, and aims to analyze their impact and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of research on socio-technical challenges, particularly community smells, affecting the quality and sustainability of quantum open-source projects.

Method: The study conducts a cross-sectional analysis to examine the socio-technical dynamics and health of quantum open-source communities.

Result: By analyzing socio-technical dynamics, the paper aims to establish foundational knowledge for mitigating risks associated with community smells.

Conclusion: Understanding socio-technical factors can ensure the sustainability of open-source quantum projects and improve community and product health.

Abstract: Quantum computing has gained significant attention due to its potential to solve computational problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. With major corporations and academic institutions investing in quantum hardware and software, there has been a rise in the development of quantum-enabled systems, particularly within open-source communities. However, despite the promising nature of quantum technologies, these communities face critical socio-technical challenges, including the emergence of socio-technical anti-patterns known as community smells. These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells. Despite the importance of these socio-technical factors, there remains a scarcity of research investigating their influence within quantum open-source communities. This work aims to address this gap by providing a first step in analyzing the socio-technical well-being of quantum communities through a cross-sectional study. By understanding the socio-technical dynamics at play, it is expected that foundational knowledge can be established to mitigate the risks associated with community smells and ensure the long-term sustainability of open-source quantum initiatives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUWM, a predictive world model for desktop software that improves agent decision-making in Office tasks by simulating UI state transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help software agents avoid errors during complex tasks where trial-and-error learning is infeasible due to deterministic and real execution environments.

Method: Developing CUWM, a system that predicts UI changes using a two-stage process—textual inference followed by screenshot synthesis—and refining it via reinforcement learning.

Result: CUWM enhances decision-making and execution robustness for agents by enabling simulated evaluations of candidate actions in Office applications.

Conclusion: CUWM facilitates safer and more effective interactions with software by enabling agents to predict the consequences of their UI actions, improving performance in structured environments like Office.

Abstract: Agents operating in complex software environments benefit from reasoning about the consequences of their actions, as even a single incorrect user interface (UI) operation can derail long, artifact-preserving workflows. This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness.

*Marco Autili,Gianluca Filippone,Mashal Afzal Memon,Patrizio Pelliccione*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ethical reasoning at runtime for self-adaptive systems, addressing evolving, varied ethical preferences and conflicts among individuals/groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of static, fixed-rule ethical systems, which fail to adapt to the diverse, evolving, and conflicting preferences of stakeholders in human-system interactions.

Method: A shift from static ethical rules to dynamic, runtime ethical reasoning that elicits, represents, and revises ethical preferences while negotiating trade-offs among multiple stakeholders.

Result: The paper identifies challenges such as ethical uncertainty, value conflicts, and multi-dimensional negotiation, and provides a research agenda for ethically self-adaptive systems.

Conclusion: Ethically self-adaptive systems demand runtime ethical reasoning to effectively address dynamic and conflicting human preferences, while conforming to hard-ethics constraints.

Abstract: Self-adaptive systems increasingly operate in close interaction with humans, often sharing the same physical or virtual environments and making decisions with ethical implications at runtime. Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems.

TL;DR: The paper suggests shifting from isolated natural language processing tools for requirements engineering to developing interconnected modules with reusable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies, lack of interoperability, complex documentation, and poor sustainability of current NLP tools used in requirements engineering.

Method: The work involved using a standard methodological framework for software reference architecture, and a stakeholder-driven focus group elicited 36 key system requirements for NLP4RE tools.

Result: The team generated a roadmap for transitioning towards reusable and interoperable modules, backed by identifying 36 generic system requirements.

Conclusion: Shifting to modular and interoperable tools can drastically improve sustainability, maintenance, and efficiency in NLP4RE tool development.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools support requirements engineering (RE) tasks like requirements elicitation, classification, and validation. However, they are often developed from scratch despite functional overlaps, and abandoned after publication. This lack of interoperability and maintenance incurs unnecessary development effort, impedes tool comparison and benchmarking, complicates documentation, and diminishes the long-term sustainability of NLP4RE tools. To address these issues, we postulate a vision to transition from monolithic NLP4RE tools to an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable modules. We outline a research roadmap towards a software reference architecture (SRA) to realize this vision, elaborated following a standard methodological framework for SRA development. As an initial step, we conducted a stakeholder-driven focus group session to elicit generic system requirements for NLP4RE tools. This activity resulted in 36 key system requirements, further motivating the need for a dedicated SRA. Overall, the proposed vision, roadmap, and initial contribution pave the way towards improved development, reuse, and long-term maintenance of NLP4RE tools.

*Minheng Chen,Jing Zhang,Tong Chen,Chao Cao,Tianming Liu,Li Su,Dajiang Zhu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new random-walk-based framework to diagnose Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia using individualized gyral folding networks, avoiding node alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia share clinical features but demand specific diagnostic approaches. Existing neuroimaging and atlas-based methods struggle with anatomical variability, especially in clinical scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework analyzes cortical folding networks using distributions of anonymized random walks, with anatomy-aware encoding that ensures permutation invariance and tolerates individualized anatomy.

Result: This method consistently outperformed existing gyral folding and atlas-based models on a large clinical cohort, showcasing its robustness against inter-individual variability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more reliable brain network classification method for dementia diagnosis by addressing key challenges in anatomical heterogeneity.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.

*Pengqi Liu,Zijun Yu,Mouloud Belbahri,Arthur Charpentier,Masoud Asgharian,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates conformal prediction (CP) and its fairness implications in decision-making pipelines, proposing methods to improve fairness in CP systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CP is effective for uncertainty quantification, its impact on fairness in downstream outcomes of decision-making has not been sufficiently studied.

Method: The authors derive theoretical bounds to evaluate fairness impacts and introduce a label-clustered CP technique for improved fairness. They also propose an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator to empirically analyze fairness across various scenarios.

Result: Label-clustered CP consistently enhances fairness, and equalized set sizes correlate with better substantive fairness outcomes compared to coverage.

Conclusion: The study advances fairness in CP systems, providing theoretical insights and practical tools to design fairer decision-making processes.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free uncertainty quantification for machine learning models, yet its interplay with fairness in downstream decision-making remains underexplored. Moving beyond CP as a standalone operation (procedural fairness), we analyze the holistic decision-making pipeline to evaluate substantive fairness-the equity of downstream outcomes. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound that decomposes prediction-set size disparity into interpretable components, clarifying how label-clustered CP helps control method-driven contributions to unfairness. To facilitate scalable empirical analysis, we introduce an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator that approximates human assessment of substantive fairness across diverse modalities. Our experiments reveal that label-clustered CP variants consistently deliver superior substantive fairness. Finally, we empirically show that equalized set sizes, rather than coverage, strongly correlate with improved substantive fairness, enabling practitioners to design more fair CP systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/llm-in-the-loop-conformal-fairness.

*Junhui Cai,Ran Chen,Qitao Huang,Linda Zhao,Wu Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Poisson-MNL model that accounts for the dependency of customer arrival rates on assortment and pricing, which classical MNL models often overlook. An efficient algorithm (PMNL) is developed with provable near-optimality and strong simulation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MNL models assume fixed customer arrival rates, potentially leading to suboptimal assortment and pricing decisions. There is a need to model the dependency of arrivals on offered assortment and prices to improve decision-making.

Method: The paper proposes a Poisson-MNL model combining a contextual MNL choice model with a Poisson arrival model influenced by assortment and pricing. It introduces a UCB-based algorithm (PMNL) with a non-asymptotic regret bound of order $\sqrt{T\log{T}}$.

Result: The PMNL algorithm demonstrates (near) optimality theoretically, with simulation results surpassing methods that assume fixed arrival rates, effectively learning customer behaviors and improving joint decisions.

Conclusion: Modeling arrival rates as dependent on assortment and pricing is critical for optimizing joint assortment-pricing decisions. The PMNL algorithm achieves theoretical near-optimality and practical performance improvement over traditional approaches.

Abstract: We study dynamic joint assortment and pricing where a seller updates decisions at regular accounting/operating intervals to maximize the cumulative per-period revenue over a horizon $T$. In many settings, assortment and prices affect not only what an arriving customer buys but also how many customers arrive within the period, whereas classical multinomial logit (MNL) models assume arrivals as fixed, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions. We propose a Poisson-MNL model that couples a contextual MNL choice model with a Poisson arrival model whose rate depends on the offered assortment and prices. Building on this model, we develop an efficient algorithm PMNL based on the idea of upper confidence bound (UCB). We establish its (near) optimality by proving a non-asymptotic regret bound of order $\sqrt{T\log{T}}$ and a matching lower bound (up to $\log T$). Simulation studies underscore the importance of accounting for the dependency of arrival rates on assortment and pricing: PMNL effectively learns customer choice and arrival models and provides joint assortment-pricing decisions that outperform others that assume fixed arrival rates.

*Juntong Chen,Claire Donnat,Olga Klopp,Johannes Schmidt-Hieber*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical insights into Graph Neural Networks' performance in semi-supervised node regression by analyzing errors and deriving approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of rigorous theory explaining why graph neural networks succeed in semi-supervised node regression.

Method: An aggregate-and-readout model is studied, with sharp risk bounds and convergence rates derived for GNNs using linear graph convolutions and nonlinear readouts.

Result: The research establishes non-asymptotic risk bounds and approximation guarantees, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The results offer a systematic understanding of Graph Neural Networks' performance and limitations, especially in semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) work remarkably well in semi-supervised node regression, yet a rigorous theory explaining when and why they succeed remains lacking. To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain generalization in low-label scenarios by penalizing model sensitivity to covariate variations, using unlabeled multi-environment data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robust domain generalization when labels are scarce and to better adapt to distribution shifts in unseen environments.

Method: Propose two methods that minimize model sensitivity to shifts in covariate mean and covariance using unlabeled multi-environment data.

Result: Proven worst-case optimality guarantees under certain environments; effectiveness demonstrated on physical system and physiological signal data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances domain generalization by leveraging unlabeled data to regularize sensitivity to environmental perturbations.

Abstract: The problem of domain generalization concerns learning predictive models that are robust to distribution shifts when deployed in new, previously unseen environments. Existing methods typically require labeled data from multiple training environments, limiting their applicability when labeled data are scarce. In this work, we study domain generalization in an anti-causal setting, where the outcome causes the observed covariates. Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments. We propose two methods that penalize the model's sensitivity to variations in the mean and covariance of the covariates across environments, respectively, and prove that these methods have worst-case optimality guarantees under certain classes of environments. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach on a controlled physical system and a physiological signal dataset.

*Etienne Lempereur,Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Florentin Coeurdoux,Stéphane Mallat,Eric Vanden-Eijnden*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD) to generate samples from limited information using stochastic differential equations for efficient and theoretically guaranteed maximal entropy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to generate samples from limited data. Current methods like maximum entropy rely on sampling methods that are inefficient in high dimensions, and generative models lack strong theoretical guarantees and may overfit with scarce data.

Method: The authors introduce MGD, which integrates moment guidance into the stochastic interpolant framework. It uses stochastic differential equations to efficiently match moments to prescribed constraints, avoiding issues of equilibrium-based methods.

Result: MGD demonstrates convergence to maximum entropy distribution under large-volatility limits and provides a tractable entropy estimator. It effectively estimates negentropy in applications such as financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields.

Conclusion: MGD connects diffusion-based generative modeling with maximum entropy principles to overcome high-dimensional sampling inefficiencies and limited-data overfitting, providing robust theoretical guarantees and practical applications.

Abstract: Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces genriesz, a Python package for automated debiased machine learning and generalized Riesz regression, enabling efficient causal and structural parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and automate causal and structural parameter estimation using a unified framework that incorporates various approaches, such as covariate balancing and density ratio estimation.

Method: The method involves the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning, implemented via generalized Riesz regression by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. Automatic regressor balancing (ARB) ensures optimality conditions.

Result: The framework produces RA, RW, ARW, and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. It also supports different estimation tasks like ATE, ATT, and average marginal effects.

Conclusion: The genriesz package facilitates efficient and versatile estimation of causal parameters, with a modular design integrating various methods for diverse workflows.

Abstract: Efficient estimation of causal and structural parameters can be automated using the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning (DML). We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation. The Python package is available at https://github.com/MasaKat0/genriesz and on PyPI.

*Roey Yadgar,Roy R. Lederman,Yoel Shkolnisky*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOLVAR, a method for analyzing molecular structural variability in cryo-EM using stochastic optimization and low-rank assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryo-EM faces the challenge of characterizing continuous molecular heterogeneity due to molecules adopting various conformational states. Efficient methods for estimating covariance in structural variability are lacking.

Method: The authors propose SOLVAR, which uses a low-rank approach to efficiently estimate covariance matrix principal components. This is achieved through an optimization problem, allowing tractable computation and refinement of input data poses.

Result: Numerical tests on synthetic and experimental datasets show SOLVAR's accuracy and computational efficiency. It outperforms other methods in capturing dominant variability components in a benchmark.

Conclusion: SOLVAR provides an innovative, efficient solution for heterogeneity analysis in cryo-EM, with improved accuracy and pose refinement capability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique for resolving the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark. The code of the algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/RoeyYadgar/SOLVAR.

Main category: cs.OH

TL;DR: Quantum computing poses risks to RSA encryption, which this paper addresses by proposing a hybrid security framework that includes classical and quantum methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of classical cryptographic methods, particularly RSA, in the face of advanced quantum computing and to ensure secure encryption in a post-quantum era.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid framework combining AES encryption, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution for secure key exchange, quantum state comparison for authentication, and bio-inspired adaptive threat detection.

Result: Preliminary analysis shows the proposed model is scalable and adaptive, with BB84 demonstrating effective key agreement and eavesdropping detection.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework balances classical and quantum elements, offering a robust, conceptual security solution for post-quantum data protection. Further implementation and validation will follow.

Abstract: Quantum computing is a significant risk to classical cryptographic, especially RSA, which depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection. This work primarily proposes a conceptual framework. Detailed implementation, security proofs, and extensive experimental validation are considered future work.

TL;DR: This paper extends omniprediction research into the multiclass setting, addressing its complexities and providing new results of broader interest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the study of omniprediction beyond binary to the more complex multiclass setting, involving infinite comparator families.

Method: The approach involves extending binary omniprediction algorithms to handle multiclass scenarios by introducing a framework inspired by Blackwell approachability.

Result: The extension to a multiclass setting achieves a sample complexity or regret horizon of approximately $\varepsilon^{-(k+1)}$ for $k$-class problems.

Conclusion: The paper opens avenues for multiclass omniprediction applications while offering valuable insights into problem-solving frameworks involving coupled actions.

Abstract: Omniprediction is a learning problem that requires suboptimality bounds for each of a family of losses $\mathcal{L}$ against a family of comparator predictors $\mathcal{C}$. We initiate the study of omniprediction in a multiclass setting, where the comparator family $\mathcal{C}$ may be infinite. Our main result is an extension of the recent binary omniprediction algorithm of [OKK25] to the multiclass setting, with sample complexity (in statistical settings) or regret horizon (in online settings) $\approx \varepsilon^{-(k+1)}$, for $\varepsilon$-omniprediction in a $k$-class prediction problem. En route to proving this result, we design a framework of potential broader interest for solving Blackwell approachability problems where multiple sets must simultaneously be approached via coupled actions.

*Genís Ruiz-Menárguez,Llorenç Badiella*

TL;DR: The study uses advanced Double Machine Learning (DML) to explore the impact of football formations on match outcomes using data from 22,000 European matches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist football coaches in choosing between defensive or offensive formations using robust statistical tools.

Method: Double Machine Learning framework adapted to categorical formations with a novel matrix-based residualization process.

Result: Offensive formations slightly improve possession and corners but have limited effect on goals; defensive formations do not enhance winning chances.

Conclusion: The paper provides a valuable analytical framework for football tactics, though it doesn’t account for all playing style or team strength factors.

Abstract: This study addresses a central tactical dilemma for football coaches: whether to employ a defensive strategy, colloquially known as "parking the bus", or a more offensive one. Using an advanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, this project provides a robust and interpretable tool to estimate the causal impact of different formations on key match outcomes such as goal difference, possession, corners, and disciplinary actions. Leveraging a dataset of over 22,000 matches from top European leagues, formations were categorized into six representative types based on tactical structure and expert consultation. A major methodological contribution lies in the adaptation of DML to handle categorical treatments, specifically formation combinations, through a novel matrix-based residualization process, allowing for a detailed estimation of formation-versus-formation effects that can inform a coach's tactical decision-making. Results show that while offensive formations like 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 offer modest statistical advantages in possession and corners, their impact on goals is limited. Furthermore, no evidence supports the idea that defensive formations, commonly associated with parking the bus, increase a team's winning potential. Additionally, red cards appear unaffected by formation choice, suggesting other behavioral factors dominate. Although this approach does not fully capture all aspects of playing style or team strength, it provides a valuable framework for coaches to analyze tactical efficiency and sets a precedent for future research in sports analytics.

Motivation: To address the need for a more robust, multilingual, and diverse FAQ dataset to support advancements in multilingual and cross-lingual information retrieval.

Method: Introduced a novel crawling and extraction strategy for data collection, incorporated hard negatives for dense retriever training, and proposed fine-tuning strategies like Contrastive Learning and Knowledge Distillation.

Result: WebFAQ 2.0 contains 198M Q&A pairs, 14.3M bilingual QA pairs, and 1.25M hard negatives across 20 languages mined using a two-stage retrieval pipeline.

Conclusion: WebFAQ 2.0 significantly enhances multilingual IR by providing a large, diverse dataset, resources, and training scripts. The dataset is regularly updated as part of a long-term Open Web Index initiative.

Abstract: We introduce WebFAQ 2.0, a new version of the WebFAQ dataset, containing 198 million FAQ-based natural question-answer pairs across 108 languages. Compared to the previous version, it significantly expands multilingual coverage and the number of bilingual aligned QA pairs to over 14.3M, making it the largest FAQ-based resource. Unlike the original release, WebFAQ 2.0 uses a novel data collection strategy that directly crawls and extracts relevant web content, resulting in a substantially more diverse and multilingual dataset with richer context through page titles and descriptions. In response to community feedback, we also release a hard negatives dataset for training dense retrievers, with 1.25M queries across 20 languages. These hard negatives were mined using a two-stage retrieval pipeline and include cross-encoder scores for 200 negatives per query. We further show how this resource enables two primary fine-tuning strategies for dense retrievers: Contrastive Learning with MultipleNegativesRanking loss, and Knowledge Distillation with MarginMSE loss. WebFAQ 2.0 is not a static resource but part of a long-term effort. Since late 2025, structured FAQs are being regularly released through the Open Web Index, enabling continuous expansion and refinement. We publish the datasets and training scripts to facilitate further research in multilingual and cross-lingual IR. The dataset itself and all related resources are publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional retrieval algorithms like BM25 and query likelihood have seen limited progress beyond parameter tuning and human intuition, prompting the need for automated and innovative solutions.

Method: The authors propose RankEvolve, an evolutionary search framework based on AlphaEvolve. The approach uses LLM-guided evaluation to mutate, recombine, and select ranking algorithms represented as executable code, tested across 12 IR datasets.

Result: RankEvolve generates effective and novel retrieval algorithms that generalize well to the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks and TREC DL 19 and 20 datasets, showing their robustness and transferability.

Conclusion: Evaluator-guided program evolution using LLMs is a viable and efficient path for creating state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms, reducing reliance on manual ingenuity.

Abstract: Retrieval algorithms like BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing remain strong and efficient first-stage rankers, yet improvements have mostly relied on parameter tuning and human intuition. We investigate whether a large language model, guided by an evaluator and evolutionary search, can automatically discover improved lexical retrieval algorithms. We introduce RankEvolve, a program evolution setup based on AlphaEvolve, in which candidate ranking algorithms are represented as executable code and iteratively mutated, recombined, and selected based on retrieval performance across 12 IR datasets from BEIR and BRIGHT. RankEvolve starts from two seed programs: BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing. The evolved algorithms are novel, effective, and show promising transfer to the full BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks as well as TREC DL 19 and 20. Our results suggest that evaluator-guided LLM program evolution is a practical path towards automatic discovery of novel ranking algorithms.

*Hien Dang,Pratik Patil,Alessandro Rinaldo*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores self-distillation (SD) for ridge regression, deriving formal guarantees and proposing methods to improve SD performance in both theory and practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To derive formal guarantees for self-distillation in ridge regression and enhance understanding of its theoretical underpinnings and practical applications.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze SD in ridge regression, deriving optimal mixing weights and studying their behavior under various regularization levels. They extend standard ridge deterministic equivalents to fourth-order expressions and propose a consistent, efficient one-shot tuning method.

Result: SD with optimally mixed weights improves upon the ridge teacher for most settings. A closed-form for optimal mixing weights was derived, aligned with theoretical predictions. Experiments validated the tuning method and theory.

Conclusion: Self-distillation offers guaranteed improvements in ridge regression, supported by theoretical advancements and practical tuning methods. The work bridges the gap between empirical success and formal guarantees.

Abstract: Self-distillation (SD) is the process of retraining a student on a mixture of ground-truth labels and the teacher's own predictions using the same architecture and training data. Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $ξ$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $λ> 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(λ)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(λ) \neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $ξ^\star(λ)$ for any value of $λ$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\operatorname{sign}(ξ^\star(λ))=-\operatorname{sign}(R'(λ))$. In particular, $ξ^\star(λ)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $ξ^\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.

TL;DR: This paper addresses one-sided and α-correct sequential hypothesis testing for data from ergodic Markov chains, providing a tight bound on stopping time and proposing an optimal test for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon existing sub-optimal or asymptotic lower bounds in sequential hypothesis testing for Markov chains by accounting for intrinsic properties like stationary distribution and transition structure.

Method: Establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound for stopping time and proposes a test that matches this bound as α approaches zero. The framework is applied to scenarios like model misspecification detection and testing structural properties in Markov systems.

Result: Presents a tight, instance-dependent stopping time lower bound and an optimally designed test achieving asymptotic efficiency in hypothesis testing under Markovian dependencies.

Conclusion: The paper provides a sharp, general characterization of optimal sequential hypothesis testing for ergodic Markov chains, enhancing its theoretical understanding and practical applications.

Abstract: We study one-sided and $α$-correct sequential hypothesis testing for data generated by an ergodic Markov chain. The null hypothesis is that the unknown transition matrix belongs to a prescribed set $P$ of stochastic matrices, and the alternative corresponds to a disjoint set $Q$. We establish a tight non-asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the expected stopping time of any valid sequential test under the alternative. Our novel analysis improves the existing lower bounds, which are either asymptotic or provably sub-optimal in this setting. Our lower bound incorporates both the stationary distribution and the transition structure induced by the unknown Markov chain. We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $α\to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes. Our findings yield a sharp and general characterization of optimal sequential testing procedures under Markovian dependence.

Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of community standards for bioprocess data in precision fermentation, which limits accessibility, interoperability, and platform integration.

Method: The researchers developed PREFER, a unified ontology based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), connecting it with community ontologies for broad domain compatibility.

Result: PREFER standardizes data and enables integrated workflows, facilitating automated cross-platform operations, high-quality data capture, and better machine-learning training.

Conclusion: This ontology provides a foundation for scalable, data-driven bioproduction systems and promotes integration across diverse bioprocess platforms.

Abstract: Precision fermentation relies on microbial cell factories to produce sustainable food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and biofuels. Specialized laboratories such as biofoundries are advancing these processes using high-throughput bioreactor platforms, which generate vast datasets. However, the lack of community standards limits data accessibility and interoperability, preventing integration across platforms. In order to address this, we introduce PREFER, an open-source ontology designed to establish a unified standard for bioprocess data. Built in alignment with the widely adopted Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and connecting with several other community ontologies, PREFER ensures consistency and cross-domain compatibility and covers the whole precision fermentation process. Integrating PREFER into high-throughput bioprocess development workflows enables structured metadata that supports automated cross-platform execution and high-fidelity data capture. Furthermore, PREFER's standardization has the potential to bridge disparate data silos, generating machine-actionable datasets critical for training predictive, robust machine learning models in synthetic biology. This work provides the foundation for scalable, interoperable bioprocess systems and supports the transition toward more data-driven bioproduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why Poisson-derived objectives might be relevant for minimizing MSE, particularly in low-dose imaging scenarios.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis through a diagonal model to compare Poisson objectives (ML and MAP) and Gaussian surrogates, supported by numerical experiments.

Result: Poisson MAP provides stable performance with regularization, while Gaussian surrogates can achieve similar MSE performance even without explicitly using the Poisson likelihood.

Conclusion: Gaussian surrogate objectives can be effective alternatives to Poisson objectives for achieving low MSE in imaging problems, even under the low-dose regime.

Abstract: In imaging inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements, it is common to use objectives derived from the Poisson likelihood. But performance is often evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), which raises a practical question: how much does a Poisson objective matter for MSE, even at low dose? We analyze the MSE of Poisson and Gaussian surrogate reconstruction objectives under Poisson noise. In a stylized diagonal model, we show that the unregularized Poisson maximum-likelihood estimator can incur large MSE at low dose, while Poisson MAP mitigates this instability through regularization. We then study two Gaussian surrogate objectives: a heteroscedastic quadratic objective motivated by the normal approximation of Poisson data, and a homoscedastic quadratic objective that yields a simple linear estimator. We show that both surrogates can achieve MSE comparable to Poisson MAP in the low-dose regime, despite departing from the Poisson likelihood. Numerical computed tomography experiments indicate that these conclusions extend beyond the stylized setting of our theoretical analysis.

### [344] [Bluetooth Phased-array Aided Inertial Navigation Using Factor Graphs: Experimental Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17407)
*Glen Hjelmerud Mørkbak Sørensen,Torleiv H. Bryne,Kristoffer Gryte,Tor Arne Johansen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper explores robust estimation strategies for a navigation system relying on phased-array Bluetooth in GNSS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of navigation in GNSS-denied scenarios using a low-cost Bluetooth-based phased-array system.

Method: The authors compare multiple robust estimation strategies within a factor graph optimisation framework using experimental data from multirotor drone flights.

Result: The study evaluates the performance of the navigation system when aided by Bluetooth angular measurements, range data, or barometric pressure under GNSS-denied conditions.

Conclusion: Using phased-array Bluetooth systems with robust estimation techniques offers potential for low-cost and effective navigation solutions in GNSS-denied scenarios despite challenges of noisy data and range limitations.

Abstract: Phased-array Bluetooth systems have emerged as a low-cost alternative for performing aided inertial navigation in GNSS-denied use cases such as warehouse logistics, drone landings, and autonomous docking. Basing a navigation system off of commercial-off-the-shelf components may reduce the barrier of entry for phased-array radio navigation systems, albeit at the cost of significantly noisier measurements and relatively short feasible range. In this paper, we compare robust estimation strategies for a factor graph optimisation-based estimator using experimental data collected from multirotor drone flight. We evaluate performance in loss-of-GNSS scenarios when aided by Bluetooth angular measurements, as well as range or barometric pressure.

*Leila Gharavi,Simone Baldi,Yuki Hosomi,Tona Sato,Bart De Schutter,Binh-Minh Nguyen,Hiroshi Fujimoto*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper addresses real-time collision avoidance in emergency scenarios using Model Predictive Control (MPC), proposing an innovative feed-forward planner to overcome real-time computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of real-time collision avoidance in emergency driving scenarios such as the moose test, which current state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC struggles with.

Method: The authors propose augmenting nonlinear MPC with a human-like feed-forward planner based on maximum steering maneuver concepts. This planner assists MPC when it fails or delivers poor solutions due to computational limitations.

Result: The proposed method was experimentally tested using the FPEV2-Kanon electric vehicle in real-life emergency scenarios, showing improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art MPC planner.

Conclusion: The integration of a human-like feed-forward planner into MPC enables real-time collision avoidance in emergency scenarios, providing a practical advancement in motion planning for automated vehicles.

Abstract: The sudden appearance of a static obstacle on the road, i.e. the moose test, is a well-known emergency scenario in collision avoidance for automated driving. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has long been employed for planning and control of automated vehicles in the state of the art. However, real-time implementation of automated collision avoidance in emergency scenarios such as the moose test remains unaddressed due to the high computational demand of MPC for evasive action in such hazardous scenarios. This paper offers new insights into real-time collision avoidance via the experimental imple- mentation of MPC for motion planning after a sudden and unexpected appearance of a static obstacle. As the state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC shows limited capability to provide an acceptable solution in real-time, we propose a human-like feed-forward planner to assist when the MPC optimization problem is either infeasible or unable to find a suitable solution due to the poor quality of its initial guess. We introduce the concept of maximum steering maneuver to design the feed-forward planner and mimic a human-like reaction after detecting the static obstacle on the road. Real-life experiments are conducted across various speeds and level of emergency using FPEV2-Kanon electric vehicle. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning strategy via comparison with the state-of- the-art MPC motion planner.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper presents a deterministic semantic state substrate implemented as a CPU-resident graph engine with results showing efficient, scalable performance in evolving semantic memory graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of inference-driven AI systems that rely on probabilistic semantic state recomposition, which scale poorly with context and token volume, by proposing a deterministic representation of semantic continuity.

Method: The authors implemented a mathematically specified semantic state substrate operating as a bounded local state evolution graph engine. Performance was measured on CPU-based memory graphs across varying node scales.

Result: The implementation exhibited invariant and efficient performance metrics, including node traversal latency (~0.25-0.32 ms), minimal CPU utilization (~17.2%), no thermal scale correlation, and high memory efficiency supporting up to 1.6 billion nodes in a 1 TiB envelope.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates a scalable and thermodynamically invariant system for semantic memory graphs, governed by memory capacity rather than computational cost, validating a novel semantic state evolution methodology.

Abstract: This paper presents empirical results from a production-grade C++ implementation of a deterministic semantic state substrate derived from prior formal work on Bounded Local Generator Classes (Martin, 2026). The system was mathematically specified prior to implementation and realized as a CPU-resident graph engine operating under bounded local state evolution.
  Contemporary inference-driven AI architectures reconstruct semantic state through probabilistic recomposition, producing compute cost that scales with token volume and context horizon. In contrast, the substrate described here represents semantic continuity as a persistent, addressable memory graph evolved under a time-modulated local operator g(t). Work is bounded by local semantic change Delta s, independent of total memory cardinality M.
  Empirical measurements on Apple M2-class silicon demonstrate invariant traversal latency (approximately 0.25 to 0.32 ms), stable CPU utilization (approximately 17.2 percent baseline with Delta CPU approximately 0 to 0.2 percent), and no scale-correlated thermal signature across 1M to 25M node regimes under sustained operation. Measured per-node density ranges from approximately 1.3 KB (Float64 baseline) to approximately 687 bytes (compressed Float32 accounting). Under binary memory accounting, this yields a 1.6 billion node capacity projection within a 1 TiB envelope.
  These results indicate an empirically invariant thermodynamic regime in which scaling is governed by memory capacity rather than inference-bound recomposition. The Compute ICE-AGE is defined as the Invariant Compute Envelope under Addressable Graph Evolution, and the empirical evidence presented demonstrates this regime up to 25M nodes.

### [347] [AdaptOrch: Task-Adaptive Multi-Agent Orchestration in the Era of LLM Performance Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16873)
*Geunbin Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaptOrch, a framework for dynamic multi-agent orchestration to optimize task performance based on topology rather than individual model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With large language models reaching comparable benchmarks across providers, single model selection per task yields diminishing returns, emphasizing the need for innovative orchestration approaches.

Method: AdaptOrch employs a topology-aware orchestration strategy, consisting of a scaling law, a routing algorithm, and an adaptive synthesis protocol to optimize task performance.

Result: Across various tasks such as coding, reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation, AdaptOrch achieves 12-23% improvement compared to static baselines using the same underlying models.

Conclusion: System-level performance is increasingly determined by orchestration design rather than individual model capability, establishing orchestration as a critical optimization target.

Abstract: As large language models from diverse providers converge toward comparable benchmark performance, the traditional paradigm of selecting a single best model per task yields diminishing returns. We argue that orchestration topology -- the structural composition of how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized -- now dominates system-level performance over individual model capability. We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs. We validate AdaptOrch across coding (SWE-bench), reasoning (GPQA), and retrieval-augmented generation tasks, demonstrating that topology-aware orchestration achieves 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models. Our results establish orchestration design as a first-class optimization target independent of model scaling.

*Rebin Saleh,Khanh Pham Dinh,Balázs Villányi,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: SEMAS is a hierarchical multi-agent system for industrial IoT predictive maintenance enabling real-time anomaly detection, interpretability, and resource efficiency through edge-fog-cloud collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static models and computational demands of LLM-based systems for on-site deployment in industrial IoT predictive maintenance.

Method: SEMAS distributes agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud tiers with lightweight computations, consensus voting, PPO-based policy optimization, and federated learning for adaptive anomaly detection.

Result: SEMAS demonstrates superior anomaly detection performance, stability in adaptation, accurate predictions under evolving conditions, and latency improvements on industrial benchmarks.

Conclusion: Resource-aware self-evolving multi-agent coordination is critical for efficient and interpretable IoT predictive maintenance under stringent latency constraints.

Abstract: Industrial IoT predictive maintenance requires systems capable of real-time anomaly detection without sacrificing interpretability or demanding excessive computational resources. Traditional approaches rely on static, offline-trained models that cannot adapt to evolving operational conditions, while LLM-based monolithic systems demand prohibitive memory and latency, rendering them impractical for on-site edge deployment. We introduce SEMAS, a self-evolving hierarchical multi-agent system that distributes specialized agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud computational tiers. Edge agents perform lightweight feature extraction and pre-filtering; Fog agents execute diversified ensemble detection with dynamic consensus voting; and Cloud agents continuously optimize system policies via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) while maintaining asynchronous, non-blocking inference. The framework incorporates LLM-based response generation for explainability and federated knowledge aggregation for adaptive policy distribution. This architecture enables resource-aware specialization without sacrificing real-time performance or model interpretability. Empirical evaluation on two industrial benchmarks (Boiler Emulator and Wind Turbine) demonstrates that SEMAS achieves superior anomaly detection performance with exceptional stability under adaptation, sustains prediction accuracy across evolving operational contexts, and delivers substantial latency improvements enabling genuine real-time deployment. Ablation studies confirm that PPO-driven policy evolution, consensus voting, and federated aggregation each contribute materially to system effectiveness. These findings indicate that resource-aware, self-evolving 1multi-agent coordination is essential for production-ready industrial IoT predictive maintenance under strict latency and explainability constraints.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Speech to Speech Synthesis Network (STSSN) for voice impersonation, succeeding in realistic audio generation and outperforming generative adversarial models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models excel in speech recognition and synthesis but lack exploration in speech-to-speech processing, which the paper aims to address through voice impersonation.

Method: The paper introduces STSSN, which merges technologies from advanced systems to achieve effective speech-to-speech style transfer.

Result: The STSSN model successfully generates realistic audio samples, overcoming capacity limitations and outperforming generative adversarial models in benchmarking.

Conclusion: The STSSN demonstrates superior capability for voice impersonation, offering promising results in realistic speech-to-speech transfer.

Abstract: Numerous models have shown great success in the fields of speech recognition as well as speech synthesis, but models for speech to speech processing have not been heavily explored. We propose Speech to Speech Synthesis Network (STSSN), a model based on current state of the art systems that fuses the two disciplines in order to perform effective speech to speech style transfer for the purpose of voice impersonation. We show that our proposed model is quite powerful, and succeeds in generating realistic audio samples despite a number of drawbacks in its capacity. We benchmark our proposed model by comparing it with a generative adversarial model which accomplishes a similar task, and show that ours produces more convincing results.

*Jennica Li,Shirley Zhang,Dakota Sullivan,Bengisu Cagiltay,Heather Kirkorian,Bilge Mutlu,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Household robots pose privacy risks, and users want designs emphasizing control, transparency, and customizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate people's concerns and preferences for privacy-aware household robots, particularly multi-user perspectives.

Method: Conducted participatory design sessions with 15 households to gather insights on preferred privacy-aware robot designs.

Result: Participants showed distrust in robots/manufacturers regarding privacy, proposing designs focused on user authority, notifications, and customizability.

Conclusion: Recommendations for manufacturers to prioritize privacy-focused robot designs catering to user control and adaptability.

Abstract: Household robots boasting mobility, more sophisticated sensors, and powerful processing models have become increasingly prevalent in the commercial market. However, these features may expose users to unwanted privacy risks, including unsolicited data collection and unauthorized data sharing. While security and privacy researchers thus far have explored people's privacy concerns around household robots, literature investigating people's preferred privacy designs and mitigation strategies is still limited. Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time. We synthesize our findings into actionable design recommendations for robot manufacturers and developers.

*Dimitri Staufer,Kirsten Morehouse*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes privacy concerns with large language models (LLMs) by auditing personal data (PD) associations across eight models and introduces the LMP2 tool for privacy-preserving analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the lack of transparency in how LLMs associate personal data (PD) with user identities and to improve users' control over their data in AI systems.

Method: The authors conducted audits on eight LLMs, developed LMP2 (a human-centered privacy audit tool refined through formative studies), and ran studies with participants to understand their reactions and impressions of model-generated PD.

Result: The study found that models could confidently generate multiple personal attributes for well-known individuals and everyday users, revealing associations like gender, hair color, and languages. Additionally, 72% of participants desired control over these associations.

Conclusion: The findings raise critical issues around the definition of personal data, user control, and the potential extension of data privacy rights to large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), and conversational agents based on them, are exposed to personal data (PD) during pre-training and during user interactions. Prior work shows that PD can resurface, yet users lack insight into how strongly models associate specific information to their identity. We audit PD across eight LLMs (3 open-source; 5 API-based, including GPT-4o), introduce LMP2 (Language Model Privacy Probe), a human-centered, privacy-preserving audit tool refined through two formative studies (N=20), and run two studies with EU residents to capture (i) intuitions about LLM-generated PD (N1=155) and (ii) reactions to tool output (N2=303). We show empirically that models confidently generate multiple PD categories for well-known individuals. For everyday users, GPT-4o generates 11 features with 60% or more accuracy (e.g., gender, hair color, languages). Finally, 72% of participants sought control over model-generated associations with their name, raising questions about what counts as PD and whether data privacy rights should extend to LLMs.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of AI-mediated feedback on students' revisions compared to traditional human-provided feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of how students respond to feedback generated by AI compared to feedback provided by humans.

Method: A randomized controlled trial in a large introductory economics course used FeedbackWriter, an AI system providing suggestions to TAs during feedback on student essays. Students were randomly assigned to receive handwritten feedback or AI-mediated feedback.

Result: Students receiving AI-mediated feedback showed significantly better essay revisions, especially when TAs integrated more AI suggestions in their feedback.

Conclusion: AI-mediated feedback helps improve essay revisions and aids teaching assistants in identifying gaps and clarifying expectations.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in using LLMs to generate feedback on students' writing, little is known about how students respond to AI-mediated versus human-provided feedback. We address this gap through a randomized controlled trial in a large introductory economics course (N=354), where we introduce and deploy FeedbackWriter - a system that generates AI suggestions to teaching assistants (TAs) while they provide feedback on students' knowledge-intensive essays. TAs have the full capacity to adopt, edit, or dismiss the suggestions. Students were randomly assigned to receive either handwritten feedback from TAs (baseline) or AI-mediated feedback where TAs received suggestions from FeedbackWriter. Students revise their drafts based on the feedback, which is further graded. In total, 1,366 essays were graded using the system. We found that students receiving AI-mediated feedback produced significantly higher-quality revisions, with gains increasing as TAs adopted more AI suggestions. TAs found the AI suggestions useful for spotting gaps and clarifying rubrics.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how to develop effective reasoning and action traces for agentic AI systems to facilitate human oversight, uncovering limitations and proposing an improved design that reduces task time without significantly enhancing user accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating reasoning and action traces in AI systems that are informative enough to help users verify the system's actions but not so complex that they overwhelm users.

Method: The authors conducted three user studies on a Computer User Agent, which included evaluating basic action traces, exploring three alternative designs through design probes, and testing a novel interface for error detection in question-answering tasks.

Result: Their proposed design reduced the time users took to identify errors and led to a reported increase in user confidence in their decisions. However, it did not result in a meaningful improvement in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in human verification of agentic systems, such as users' subjective correctness criteria and communication of the AI's process, emphasizing the necessity of balancing detail and usability in AI system transparency.

Abstract: To enable human oversight, agentic AI systems often provide a trace of reasoning and action steps. Designing traces to have an informative, but not overwhelming, level of detail remains a critical challenge. In three user studies on a Computer User Agent, we investigate the utility of basic action traces for verification, explore three alternatives via design probes, and test a novel interface's impact on error finding in question-answering tasks. As expected, we find that current practices are cumbersome, limiting their efficacy. Conversely, our proposed design reduced the time participants spent finding errors. However, although participants reported higher levels of confidence in their decisions, their final accuracy was not meaningfully improved. To this end, our study surfaces challenges for human verification of agentic systems, including managing built-in assumptions, users' subjective and changing correctness criteria, and the shortcomings, yet importance, of communicating the agent's process.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates customization techniques for assistive visual question answering (VQA) for blind users by analyzing 418 interactions from 11 blind participants and proposes improvements using prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the rigidity and lack of customization in assistive VQA tools for blind users, as misaligned system responses can negatively impact accessibility and usability for this population.

Method: The study involved 11 blind users interacting with a real-world conversational VQA system across 418 interactions. Both pre-defined and independently developed prompting techniques were analyzed through participant feedback and post-study interviews.

Result: Participants faced limitations in system features (e.g., lack of verbosity controls, poor camera guidance) and used prompting techniques to overcome these shortcomings. Interactions often spanned multiple turns, averaging 3 turns per session, with significant differences in input and output lengths.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering and customizable interaction features can significantly improve the utility of VQA systems for blind users, aiding them in navigating limitations. The study's findings and dataset inform better interaction design at multiple levels.

Abstract: Prompting and steering techniques are well established in general-purpose generative AI, yet assistive visual question answering (VQA) tools for blind users still follow rigid interaction patterns with limited opportunities for customization. User control can be helpful when system responses are misaligned with their goals and contexts, a gap that becomes especially consequential for blind users that may rely on these systems for access. We invite 11 blind users to customize their interactions with a real-world conversational VQA system. Drawing on 418 interactions, reflections, and post-study interviews, we analyze prompting-based techniques participants adopted, including those introduced in the study and those developed independently in real-world settings. VQA interactions were often lengthy: participants averaged 3 turns, sometimes up to 21, with input text typically tenfold shorter than the responses they heard. Built on state-of-the-art LLMs, the system lacked verbosity controls, was limited in estimating distance in space and time, relied on inaccessible image framing, and offered little to no camera guidance. We discuss how customization techniques such as prompt engineering can help participants work around these limitations. Alongside a new publicly available dataset, we offer insights for interaction design at both query and system levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in motion estimation for biological samples confined by acoustical force fields in ODT, as accurate motion estimation is key to stable reconstructions.

Method: The authors implement the common circle method, using intersections of Ewald spheres in Fourier space and integrating temporal consistency constraints for stable motion reconstruction.

Result: Experiments with simulated and real-world data show that the method is computationally efficient and effective, serving as an alternative to optimization-heavy approaches.

Conclusion: The common circle method is a practical and efficient solution for motion estimation in ODT, improving motion detection and reconstruction stability.

Abstract: We investigate the application of the common circle method for estimating sample motion in optical diffraction tomography (ODT) of sub-millimeter sized biological tissue. When samples are confined via contact-free acoustical force fields, their motion must be estimated from the captured images. The common circle method identifies intersections of Ewald spheres in Fourier space to determine rotational motion. This paper presents a practical implementation, incorporating temporal consistency constraints to achieve stable reconstructions. Our results on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the common circle method provides a computationally efficient alternative to full optimization methods for motion detection.

*Michael Groom,Davide Bassetti,Illia Horenko,Terence J. O'Kane*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This study presents a distillation framework for improving the interpretability of ensemble ENSO prediction models while maintaining their forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the interpretability of state-of-the-art ensemble ENSO prediction models, which are complex and diagnostically challenging, while preserving their forecasting abilities.

Method: The framework distills ensemble predictions by aggregating structures of members that yield correct results into a condensed model for each lead time. This involves analyzing spatiotemporal dynamics, regime persistence, and feature importance vectors.

Result: The distilled models match ensemble-level forecast accuracy, effectively capture ENSO dynamics, and identify spatiotemporal predictors and physical precursors. They also analyze input space complexity and provide meaningful diagnostics.

Conclusion: The distillation framework improves the usability of ensemble ENSO models by enabling detailed diagnostic investigations, offering both accuracy and interpretability for operational forecasting and long-range predictability studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a distillation framework for an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models, trained exclusively on satellite-era observational and reanalysis data to predict ENSO phase up to 24 months in advance. While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of "distilled" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.
  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model "superclusters", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlphaEvolve, a tool that uses large language models to automatically generate new multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, demonstrating its efficacy by developing advanced variants for two game-theoretic learning paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on human intuition and manual design in creating advanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms for imperfect-information games, thereby enabling more systematic, scalable discoveries.

Method: AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary agent powered by large language models, was used to autonomously explore algorithmic design spaces and generate novel learning approaches for iterative regret minimization and population-based training algorithms.

Result: The proposed framework produced two innovative algorithms: VAD-CFR (with mechanisms like volatility-sensitive discounting and optimism) and SHOR-PSRO (which employs hybrid meta-solvers and adaptive training dynamics), both outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AlphaEvolve showcases the potential of automating algorithm development in MARL by efficiently evolving sophisticated, high-performing learning strategies, representing a notable advancement in game-theoretic AI research.

Abstract: Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simplified transformer architecture tailored for analyzing longitudinal cohort data with a small number of time points and individuals, achieving both predictive performance and context dependency discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the successful transformer architecture for longitudinal cohort data, usually limited by small datasets, while maintaining the ability to model complex temporal dependencies and uncover contextual patterns.

Method: A simplified transformer architecture is developed, incorporating attention as a kernel-based operation with temporal decay, derived from an autoregressive model. Statistical testing procedures for contextual pattern identification are also introduced.

Result: The approach effectively recovers contextual dependencies and identifies temporal patterns in stress and mental health dynamics, demonstrated through simulations and real resilience study data.

Conclusion: The simplified transformer is both predictive and capable of uncovering contextual dependencies with small datasets, validating its effectiveness in longitudinal cohort analysis.

Abstract: Modeling of longitudinal cohort data typically involves complex temporal dependencies between multiple variables. There, the transformer architecture, which has been highly successful in language and vision applications, allows us to account for the fact that the most recently observed time points in an individual's history may not always be the most important for the immediate future. This is achieved by assigning attention weights to observations of an individual based on a transformation of their values. One reason why these ideas have not yet been fully leveraged for longitudinal cohort data is that typically, large datasets are required. Therefore, we present a simplified transformer architecture that retains the core attention mechanism while reducing the number of parameters to be estimated, to be more suitable for small datasets with few time points. Guided by a statistical perspective on transformers, we use an autoregressive model as a starting point and incorporate attention as a kernel-based operation with temporal decay, where aggregation of multiple transformer heads, i.e. different candidate weighting schemes, is expressed as accumulating evidence on different types of underlying characteristics of individuals. This also enables a permutation-based statistical testing procedure for identifying contextual patterns. In a simulation study, the approach is shown to recover contextual dependencies even with a small number of individuals and time points. In an application to data from a resilience study, we identify temporal patterns in the dynamics of stress and mental health. This indicates that properly adapted transformers can not only achieve competitive predictive performance, but also uncover complex context dependencies in small data settings.

*Dan M. Kluger,Stephen Bates*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper develops statistical methods for adaptive two-phase multiwave sampling with efficiency improvements using proxy information while maintaining validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of balancing efficiency and valid statistical inference under adaptive sampling when expensive measurements are selectively collected.

Method: The paper introduces the Multiwave Predict-Then-Debias estimator, combining proxy data and expensive measurements, and develops asymptotic properties and confidence intervals alongside a greedy sampling strategy.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves valid inference with efficiency gains, as shown through data-based simulation studies and theoretical demonstrations.

Conclusion: Adaptive sampling can be made more efficient while maintaining statistical validity by leveraging proxy data and designing effective estimation methods like Multiwave Predict-Then-Debias.

Abstract: In two-phase multiwave sampling, inexpensive measurements are collected on a large sample and expensive, more informative measurements are adaptively obtained on subsets of units across multiple waves. Adaptively collecting the expensive measurements can increase efficiency but complicates statistical inference. We give valid estimators and confidence intervals for M-estimation under adaptive two-phase multiwave sampling. We focus on the case where proxies for the expensive variables -- such as predictions from pretrained machine learning models -- are available for all units and propose a Multiwave Predict-Then-Debias estimator that combines proxy information with the expensive, higher-quality measurements to improve efficiency while removing bias. We establish asymptotic linearity and normality and propose asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also develop an approximately greedy sampling strategy that improves efficiency relative to uniform sampling. Data-based simulation studies support the theoretical results and demonstrate efficiency gains.

*Tianyuan Cheng,Ruirui Mao,Judea Pearl,Ang Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper presents a sample size framework based on the delta method to estimate bounds for probabilities of causation (PoCs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on sample size analysis for estimating probabilities of causation, which are critical for decision-making but not point identifiable.

Method: The authors propose a sample size framework using the delta method that applies where PoC bounds are finite minima/maxima of linear combinations of probabilities. They validate this approach using simulation studies.

Result: The results indicate that the proposed sample size calculation ensures stable estimation of PoC bounds.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic method for determining the necessary sample sizes needed to estimate PoCs reliably, which advances current methodologies.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation (PoCs), such as the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS), are important tools for decision making but are generally not point identifiable. Existing work has derived bounds for these quantities using combinations of experimental and observational data. However, there is very limited research on sample size analysis, namely, how many experimental and observational samples are required to achieve a desired margin of error. In this paper, we propose a general sample size framework based on the delta method. Our approach applies to settings in which the target bounds of PoCs can be expressed as finite minima or maxima of linear combinations of experimental and observational probabilities. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed sample size calculations lead to stable estimation of these bounds.

TL;DR: The study evaluates cost-effective alternatives, MALDI-TOF and AR patterns, to WGS for rapid detection of hospital outbreaks, using a machine learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find cost-effective and rapid methods for identifying hospital outbreak clusters, addressing the high cost and time constraints of WGS.

Method: Develops a machine learning approach to analyze MALDI-TOF spectra and AR patterns, and investigates their fusion for outbreak detection.

Result: Finds that MALDI-TOF and AR patterns can, in certain cases, serve as effective alternatives to the more expensive and time-intensive WGS for outbreak surveillance.

Conclusion: MALDI-TOF and AR patterns show promising potential to enable quicker and more accessible outbreak detection, complementing or reducing reliance on WGS.

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of hospital outbreak clusters is crucial for preventing the spread of infections that have epidemic potential. While assessing pathogen similarity through whole genome sequencing (WGS) is considered the gold standard for outbreak detection, its high cost and lengthy turnaround time preclude routine implementation in clinical laboratories. We explore the utility of two rapid and cost-effective alternatives to WGS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and antimicrobial resistance (AR) patterns. We develop a machine learning framework that extracts informative representations from MALDI-TOF spectra and AR patterns for outbreak detection and explore their fusion. Through multi-species analyses, we demonstrate that in some cases MALDI-TOF and AR have the potential to reduce reliance on WGS, enabling more accessible and rapid outbreak surveillance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes U-FedTomAtt, a federated learning framework for diagnosing tomato diseases efficiently on edge devices with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for accurate, privacy-preserving tomato disease recognition in geographically dispersed farms while overcoming resource constraints and limitations of centralised training models.

Method: The method involves designing an ultra-lightweight neural network using dilated bottleneck modules and a linear transformer to optimize efficiency. Additionally, the authors develop a novel attention mechanism (LoGRA) to mitigate accuracy loss and propose the FedDAWA algorithm for improved global model accuracy.

Result: Experimental results highlight high Top-1 accuracy (0.9910%-0.9915%) and F1-scores (0.9897%-0.9923%) for tomato disease recognition across datasets, validating the framework's performance.

Conclusion: The U-FedTomAtt model provides an effective and resource-efficient solution for federated learning in precision agriculture, enabling accurate disease detection with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving and efficient approach for deploying intelligent agricultural solutions. Accurate edge-based diagnosis across geographically dispersed farms is crucial for recognising tomato diseases in sustainable farming. Traditional centralised training aggregates raw data on a central server, leading to communication overhead, privacy risks and latency. Meanwhile, edge devices require lightweight networks to operate effectively within limited resources. In this paper, we propose U-FedTomAtt, an ultra-lightweight federated learning framework with attention for tomato disease recognition in resource-constrained and distributed environments. The model comprises only 245.34K parameters and 71.41 MFLOPS. First, we propose an ultra-lightweight neural network with dilated bottleneck (DBNeck) modules and a linear transformer to minimise computational and memory overhead. To mitigate potential accuracy loss, a novel local-global residual attention (LoGRA) module is incorporated. Second, we propose the federated dual adaptive weight aggregation (FedDAWA) algorithm that enhances global model accuracy. Third, our framework is validated using three benchmark datasets for tomato diseases under simulated federated settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 0.9910% and 0.9915% Top-1 accuracy and 0.9923% and 0.9897% F1-scores on SLIF-Tomato and PlantVillage tomato datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system for privacy-aware LLM inference by splitting computation between trusted and untrusted GPUs, emphasizing token anonymity, latency optimization, and performance scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical privacy-preserving mechanism that allows large language model inference across trusted local devices and untrusted cloud environments, addressing latency and privacy concerns.

Method: The approach involves splitting transformer networks asymmetrically between devices, applying lookahead decoding to reduce WAN latency, and optimizing privacy-performance tradeoff via empirical and ablation evaluations.

Result: The system achieves efficient LLM decoding with reduced latency and privacy risk while maintaining scalability and accuracy for larger models like Mistral NeMo, with experimentally validated throughput results.

Conclusion: This system provides a scalable and efficient framework for LLM inference with improved privacy, adaptability for different models, and optimized performance over wide-area networks.

Abstract: We present a practical system for privacy-aware large language model (LLM) inference that splits a transformer between a trusted local GPU and an untrusted cloud GPU, communicating only intermediate activations over the network. Our system addresses the unique challenges of autoregressive LLM decoding over high-latency wide-area networks (WANs), contributing: (1) an asymmetric layer split where embedding and unembedding layers remain local, ensuring raw tokens never leave the trusted device; (2) the first application of lookahead decoding to split inference over WANs, amortizing network round-trip latency across multiple tokens per iteration; (3) an empirical inversion attack evaluation showing that split depth provides a tunable privacy-performance tradeoff -- an attacker can recover ~59%% of tokens at a 2-layer split but only ~35%% at an 8-layer split, with minimal throughput impact; (4) ablation experiments showing that n-gram speculation accepts 1.2-1.3 tokens per decoding step on average (peak of 7 observed on code), with acceptance rates consistent across model scales; (5) formal verification that lookahead decoding produces token-identical output to sequential decoding under greedy argmax, with zero quality degradation; and (6) scaling validation on Mistral NeMo 12B (40 layers), demonstrating that the system generalizes to larger models with only 4.9 GB local VRAM and matching 7B throughput. Evaluated on Mistral 7B and NeMo 12B over a ~80ms WAN link, our system achieves 8.7-9.3 tok/s (7B) and 7.8-8.7 tok/s (12B) with lookahead decoding, with an RTT decomposition model (validated at <6.2%% cross-validation error) projecting 15-19 tok/s at 20ms RTT.

### [364] [NESSiE: The Necessary Safety Benchmark -- Identifying Errors that should not Exist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16756)
*Johannes Bertram,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NESSiE is a benchmark designed to test basic safety measures in large language models (LLMs). It shows that even state-of-the-art models fail to meet necessary safety conditions, even without adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address safety issues in LLMs by creating a simple yet effective benchmark to highlight fundamental safety failures, ensuring that models meet minimum safety standards before deployment.

Method: The authors designed NESSiE with minimal test cases to assess safety relevant to information and access security. The Safe & Helpful (SH) metric was introduced to compare safety and helpfulness trade-offs.

Result: Even leading LLMs fail to perform perfectly on NESSiE, prioritizing helpfulness over safety. Disabled reasoning and unrelated context further degrade results.

Conclusion: Passing basic safety tests like NESSiE is necessary for deploying LLMs responsibly, as the current state of models poses critical safety risks when used in real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce NESSiE, the NEceSsary SafEty benchmark for large language models (LLMs). With minimal test cases of information and access security, NESSiE reveals safety-relevant failures that should not exist, given the low complexity of the tasks. NESSiE is intended as a lightweight, easy-to-use sanity check for language model safety and, as such, is not sufficient for guaranteeing safety in general -- but we argue that passing this test is necessary for any deployment. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach 100% on NESSiE and thus fail our necessary condition of language model safety, even in the absence of adversarial attacks. Our Safe & Helpful (SH) metric allows for direct comparison of the two requirements, showing models are biased toward being helpful rather than safe. We further find that disabled reasoning for some models, but especially a benign distraction context degrade model performance. Overall, our results underscore the critical risks of deploying such models as autonomous agents in the wild. We make the dataset, package and plotting code publicly available.

### [365] [What Makes a Good LLM Agent for Real-world Penetration Testing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17622)
*Gelei Deng,Yi Liu,Yuekang Li,Ruozhao Yang,Xiaofei Xie,Jie Zhang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM-based penetration testing systems, identifying two failure modes (capability gaps and planning/state issues) and introduces Excalibur, a new agent utilizing difficulty-aware planning to overcome traditional limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents promise automation in penetration testing, but they suffer from inconsistent performance and limitations in planning and state management, necessitating improvement.

Method: The authors analyzed 28 LLM-based systems, evaluated 5 through benchmarks, and developed Excalibur. It combines robust tooling with a Task Difficulty Assessment mechanism to guide planning and effort allocation.

Result: Excalibur showed significant improvement, achieving up to 91% task completion on benchmarks and outperforming prior systems in practical tests, like compromising 4 of 5 hosts in an Active Directory environment.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware planning can address key limitations in LLM-based penetration testing agents, offering consistent performance improvements that model scaling alone cannot resolve.

Abstract: LLM-based agents show promise for automating penetration testing, yet reported performance varies widely across systems and benchmarks. We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains.
  Based on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems. These results show that difficulty-aware planning yields consistent end-to-end gains across models and addresses a limitation that model scaling alone does not eliminate.

### [366] [Intent Laundering: AI Safety Datasets Are Not What They Seem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16729)
*Shahriar Golchin,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AI safety datasets and exposes their failure to represent real-world attacks due to reliance on explicit triggering cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the mismatch between AI safety dataset evaluations and real-world adversarial behaviors.

Method: The authors assessed widely used AI safety datasets both in isolation based on key properties and in practice via a technique called 'intent laundering' to abstract triggering cues away from attacks.

Result: The study found that current datasets fail to reflect genuine safety risks, leading to unsafe models once triggering cues are removed; intent laundering was shown to achieve high attack success rates as a jailbreaking technique.

Conclusion: AI safety datasets are inadequate in representing realistic adversarial behaviors and need substantial improvement for effective model safety evaluations.

Abstract: We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.

*René Brinkhege,Prahlad Menon*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAVE, a system using language models for controlled and secure interaction with private documents via natural language queries while adhering to usage policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of securely sharing sensitive inter-organizational data without disclosing entire documents or requiring manual redaction.

Method: The authors present a novel architecture where QA requests are managed by a spokesperson service, applying policy-driven virtual redaction at query time, integrated with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies.

Result: An initial prototype to manage QA requests through spokesperson services is proposed. However, full implementation and empirical evaluation are pending.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture offers a pathway for securing information sharing using policy-managed language models, with future work needed for evaluation and performance refinement.

Abstract: In current inter-organizational data spaces, usage policies are enforced mainly at the asset level: a whole document or dataset is either shared or withheld. When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the robustness of Mamba under software and hardware threat models for medical imaging benchmarks, showing vulnerabilities to a range of attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models like Mamba can efficiently process medical imaging data, but their robustness under real-world threats has not been sufficiently studied.

Method: Robustness of Mamba is evaluated using MedM-NIST benchmarks under various attacks: adversarial noise (FGSM/PGD), occlusion (PatchDrop), acquisition corruptions (e.g., Gaussian noise, blur), and software-simulated hardware faults (bit-flip injections).

Result: Findings reveal vulnerabilities to these attack types, significantly impacting accuracy and justifying the need for robust defenses.

Conclusion: Defenses must be developed to ensure secure deployment of Mamba in practical medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: State-space models like Mamba offer linear-time sequence processing and low memory, making them attractive for medical imaging. However, their robustness under realistic software and hardware threat models remains underexplored. This paper evaluates Mamba on multiple MedM-NIST classification benchmarks under input-level attacks, including white-box adversarial perturbations (FGSM/PGD), occlusion-based PatchDrop, and common acquisition corruptions (Gaussian noise and defocus blur) as well as hardware-inspired fault attacks emulated in software via targeted and random bit-flip injections into weights and activations. We profile vulnerabilities and quantify impacts on accuracy indicating that defenses are needed for deployment.

*Scott Thornton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Adversarial comments minimally impact AI code review vulnerability detection across tested LLMs, even with varying strategies. Automated defenses, especially static analysis, improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if adversarial code comments can mislead large language models in detecting vulnerabilities, as such attacks have shown effectiveness in degrading LLM performance in other areas like code generation.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 100 code samples in Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants. Conducted 9,366 trials across eight LLMs (commercial and open-source) and tested automated defenses through an additional 4,646 trials.

Result: Adversarial comments showed small, statistically non-significant impact on detection accuracy. Static analysis cross-referencing was the most effective defense, achieving 96.9% detection and recovering 47% of baseline misses.

Conclusion: Unlike code generation, vulnerability detection by LLMs is robust to adversarial comment manipulation. Static analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy.

Abstract: AI-assisted code review is widely used to detect vulnerabilities before production release. Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.

*Simon Lermen,Daniel Paleka,Joshua Swanson,Michael Aerni,Nicholas Carlini,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can perform deanonymization at scale by matching pseudonymous profiles using unstructured text data across different platforms, achieving high precision and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the capabilities of LLMs in compromising the anonymity of pseudonymous online users, as traditional protections for online privacy are becoming inadequate.

Method: An attack pipeline leveraging LLMs was designed to extract identity-relevant features, search for candidate matches using semantic embeddings, and validate matches to reduce false positives. The approach was tested on multiple datasets, linking pseudonymous profiles across platforms.

Result: The proposed LLM-based methods achieved up to 68% recall at 90% precision, surpassing traditional methods that performed near zero in the same tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs pose a significant threat to online pseudonymity, as they effectively deanonymize user profiles across platforms. Online privacy threat models should be reevaluated in light of these findings.

Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.

*Nithin Sugavanam,Emre Ertin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper discusses using neural structures for 3D SAR imaging, addressing issues caused by incomplete 3D Fourier data, and proposes a surface scattering model for better image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D SAR imaging by overcoming Fourier domain gaps and providing better reconstructed imagery using advanced modeling techniques.

Method: The method involves using neural structures to model surface scattering, encoding object surfaces as signed distance functions, and regularizing surface estimation by sampling points during training.

Result: The model demonstrates effective representation of target scattering in both measured and simulated SAR data for single vehicles and larger scenes.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for improved 3D SAR imaging and emphasizes future research in learning complex-valued neural representations for advanced collection synthesis.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper compares Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO) for portfolio management, showcasing DRL's strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the practical effectiveness of DRL methods compared to traditional MVO techniques in portfolio optimization.

Method: A thorough empirical comparison of the performance of DRL agents and MVO through backtesting on historical market data. Detailed adjustments for both methods are provided.

Result: The DRL agents demonstrate strong performance in metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and absolute returns compared to MVO.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of DRL to outperform traditional portfolio optimization methods, suggesting its viability in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Portfolio Management is the process of overseeing a group of investments, referred to as a portfolio, with the objective of achieving predetermined investment goals. Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation.
  Recent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective.
  Our work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO.

### [373] [Do GPUs Really Need New Tabular File Formats?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17335)
*Jigao Luo,Qi Chen,Carsten Binnig*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Parquet, commonly used in analytical systems, is optimized for CPU usage but not for GPU parallelism. Adjusting Parquet settings can significantly enhance GPU data processing without altering the format itself.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in how Parquet files utilize GPU parallelism due to configurations originally designed for CPU-centric models.

Method: Analyzing the impact of Parquet configurations on GPU performance and proposing GPU-aware adjustments to optimize data processing.

Result: Effective read bandwidth was improved up to 125 GB/s by employing GPU-oriented configurations.

Conclusion: Suboptimal configurations, not the format itself, hinder Parquet's GPU performance. By adopting GPU-aware settings, significant performance improvements can be achieved without changes to the Parquet specification.

Abstract: Parquet is the de facto columnar file format in modern analytical systems, yet its configuration guidelines have largely been shaped by CPU-centric execution models. As GPU-accelerated data processing becomes increasingly prevalent, Parquet files generated with CPU-oriented defaults can severely underutilize GPU parallelism, turning GPU scans into a performance bottleneck.
  In this work, we systematically study how Parquet configurations affect GPU scan performance. We show that Parquet's poor GPU performance is not inherent to the format itself but rather a consequence of suboptimal configuration choices. By applying GPU-aware configurations, we increase effective read bandwidth up to 125 GB/s without modifying the Parquet specification.

Method: The study includes a taxonomy of GPU optimizations, evaluation of six leading algorithms across eight large-scale datasets, and detailed analysis of computational bottlenecks and trade-offs related to scalability and memory usage.

Result: Distance computation is identified as the primary bottleneck, while CPU-GPU data transfer drives latency in large-scale systems. Trade-offs among scalability and memory usage are highlighted.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for designing scalable GPU-powered ANNS systems and serve as a benchmark for researchers in data mining and machine learning.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) underpins many large-scale data mining and machine learning applications, with efficient retrieval increasingly hinging on GPU acceleration as dataset sizes grow. Although graph-based approaches represent the state of the art in approximate nearest neighbor search, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding their optimization for modern GPU architectures and their end-to-end effectiveness in practical scenarios. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey and experimental study of GPU-accelerated graph-based vector search algorithms. We establish a detailed taxonomy of GPU optimization strategies and clarify the mapping between algorithmic tasks and hardware execution units within GPUs. Through a thorough evaluation of six leading algorithms on eight large-scale benchmark datasets, we assess both graph index construction and query search performance. Our analysis reveals that distance computation remains the primary computational bottleneck, while data transfer between the host CPU and GPU emerges as the dominant factor influencing real-world latency at large scale. We also highlight key trade-offs in scalability and memory usage across different system designs. Our findings offer clear guidelines for designing scalable and robust GPU-powered approximate nearest neighbor search systems, and provide a comprehensive benchmark for the knowledge discovery and data mining community.

*Bowen Cao,Weibin Liao,Yushi Sun,Dong Fang,Haitao Li,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: APEX-SQL introduces a framework for Text-to-SQL systems focusing on agentic exploration rather than simple translation, improving performance in complex database environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL systems struggle in enterprise settings due to static schema limitations, semantic ambiguity, and inability to scale to complex databases.

Method: APEX-SQL employs a hypothesis-verification loop, schema linking using logical planning, dual-pathway pruning, parallel data profiling, and deterministic exploration mechanisms for SQL generation.

Result: APEX-SQL outperformed baselines with improved execution accuracy on BIRD (70.65%) and Spider 2.0-Snow (51.01%) while reducing token consumption.

Conclusion: Agentic exploration enhances foundation models' reasoning capabilities, making them more effective for complex enterprise settings, with each framework component being critical for performance.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems powered by Large Language Models have excelled on academic benchmarks but struggle in complex enterprise environments. The primary limitation lies in their reliance on static schema representations, which fails to resolve semantic ambiguity and scale effectively to large, complex databases. To address this, we propose APEX-SQL, an Agentic Text-to-SQL Framework that shifts the paradigm from passive translation to agentic exploration. Our framework employs a hypothesis-verification loop to ground model reasoning in real data. In the schema linking phase, we use logical planning to verbalize hypotheses, dual-pathway pruning to reduce the search space, and parallel data profiling to validate column roles against real data, followed by global synthesis to ensure topological connectivity. For SQL generation, we introduce a deterministic mechanism to retrieve exploration directives, allowing the agent to effectively explore data distributions, refine hypotheses, and generate semantically accurate SQLs. Experiments on BIRD (70.65% execution accuracy) and Spider 2.0-Snow (51.01% execution accuracy) demonstrate that APEX-SQL outperforms competitive baselines with reduced token consumption. Further analysis reveals that agentic exploration acts as a performance multiplier, unlocking the latent reasoning potential of foundation models in enterprise settings. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of each component in ensuring robust and accurate data analysis.
