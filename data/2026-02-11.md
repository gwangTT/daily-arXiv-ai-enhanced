### [1] [A Small-Scale System for Autoregressive Program Synthesis Enabling Controlled Experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09112)
*Russ Webb,Jason Ramapuram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Cadmus,' a low-cost system including a small transformer model trained on integer programs. Cadmus enables research in program synthesis without the complexities of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address limitations of using large language models (LLMs) for studying program synthesis, such as compute/storage demands, understanding fine-tuning/tokenization, and difficulties in controlling training distributions.

Method: The Cadmus system consists of an integer virtual machine, a dataset of true programs, and a small autoregressive transformer model trained for under $200.

Result: Cadmus models achieve 100% accuracy on integer arithmetic program completion tasks, outperforming GPT-5, showcasing transparency and fine-grained control over training distributions.

Conclusion: Small, affordable models like Cadmus can enable effective research in program synthesis, as they provide insights and control that are challenging with LLMs.

Abstract: What research can be pursued with small models trained to complete true programs? Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.

### [2] [Uncertainty-Aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition through Dirichlet Parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09121)
*Rémi Grzeczkowicz,Eric Soriano,Ali Janati,Miyu Zhang,Gerard Comas-Quiles,Victor Carballo Araruna,Aneesh Jonelagadda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modular and lightweight multimodal emotion recognition framework for edge devices using speech, text, and facial imagery inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile and privacy-preserving emotion recognition framework suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The framework employs modality-specific backbones optimized for inference efficiency and introduces an uncertainty-aware model fusion mechanism based on Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence.

Result: The method demonstrated competitive accuracy and robustness on five benchmark datasets, maintaining efficiency and modularity in handling ambiguous or missing inputs.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalability, modularity, and uncertainty-awareness, making it suitable for real-world applications such as healthcare and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) framework designed for deployment on edge devices. To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications.

### [3] [PABU: Progress-Aware Belief Update for Efficient LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09138)
*Haitao Jiang,Lin Ge,Hengrui Cai,Rui Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a framework optimizing agent state representation to improve task completion and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce redundant actions and inference costs caused by conditioning actions on full action-observation histories in LLM agents.

Method: The framework, PABU, models task progress explicitly, selectively retains interactions, and uses relative progress prediction for efficient belief-state updates.

Result: PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming prior SoTA models by 23.9% and reduces interaction steps by 26.9%.

Conclusion: Explicit progress modeling and selective retention are essential for efficient and robust belief-state learning in LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents commonly condition actions on full action-observation histories, which introduce task-irrelevant information that easily leads to redundant actions and higher inference cost. We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction. Ablation studies show that both explicit progress prediction and selective retention are necessary for robust belief learning and performance gains.

### [4] [CoMMa: Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents From A Game-Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09159)
*Yichen Wu,Yujin Oh,Sangjoon Park,Kailong Fan,Dania Daye,Hana Farzaneh,Xiang Li,Raul Uppot,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoMMa, a decentralized multi-agent framework using deterministic embedding projections for oncology decision support tasks, demonstrating improved accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oncology decision-making involves reasoning over dynamic and heterogeneous patient data. Current methods lack robustness and transparency in decision pathways.

Method: CoMMa employs decentralized LLM-agents that partition evidence and coordinate using a game-theoretic approach, with deterministic embedding projections for contribution-aware credit assignment.

Result: CoMMa surpasses data-centralized and role-based multi-agent baselines in accuracy and stability when evaluated on real-world and benchmark oncology datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers interpretable and stable decision pathways, showing its potential for robust oncology decision tasks.

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks have broadened the ability to tackle oncology decision support tasks that require reasoning over dynamic, heterogeneous patient data. We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.

### [5] [FlyAOC: Evaluating Agentic Ontology Curation of Drosophila Scientific Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09163)
*Xingjian Zhang,Sophia Moylan,Ziyang Xiong,Qiaozhu Mei,Yichen Luo,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FlyBench evaluates AI agents in end-to-end ontology curation for scientific literature, focusing on gene annotation tasks from Drosophila research using a curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture the end-to-end workflow of ontology-grounded scientific curation required for structured, queryable knowledge, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The authors developed FlyBench, where AI agents analyze and curate gene-related data by searching and annotating information from 16,898 full-text papers. Baseline performance was tested using various AI agent designs.

Result: Multi-agent architectures perform better than simpler methods in producing structured knowledge, but scaling models shows limited improvement. Current baselines leave room for better performance.

Conclusion: FlyBench highlights the gaps in AI agent capabilities for scientific curation and aims to catalyze advancements in retrieval-augmented reasoning applicable to diverse scientific fields.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge bases accelerate discovery by curating findings from primary literature into structured, queryable formats for both human researchers and emerging AI systems. Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains.

### [6] [Human Control Is the Anchor, Not the Answer: Early Divergence of Oversight in Agentic AI Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09286)
*Hanjing Shi,Dominic DiFranzo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes early oversight expectations in two Reddit communities, showing divergence in themes and the need for role-specific AI oversight mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how early-stage oversight expectations for agentic AI diverge across different roles, represented by two Reddit communities.

Method: The study employed topic modeling in a shared comparison space, oversight-theme abstraction, engagement-weighted salience, and divergence tests.

Result: Clear thematic divergence was observed; r/OpenClaw focuses on execution guardrails and recovery, while r/Moltbook focuses on identity, legitimacy, and accountability.

Conclusion: Oversight mechanisms for agentic AI should be tailored to specific roles rather than applying generalized control policies.

Abstract: Oversight for agentic AI is often discussed as a single goal ("human control"), yet early adoption may produce role-specific expectations. We present a comparative analysis of two newly active Reddit communities in Jan--Feb 2026 that reflect different socio-technical roles: r/OpenClaw (deployment and operations) and r/Moltbook (agent-centered social interaction). We conceptualize this period as an early-stage crystallization phase, where oversight expectations form before norms reach equilibrium.
  Using topic modeling in a shared comparison space, a coarse-grained oversight-theme abstraction, engagement-weighted salience, and divergence tests, we show the communities are strongly separable (JSD =0.418, cosine =0.372, permutation $p=0.0005$). Across both communities, "human control" is an anchor term, but its operational meaning diverges: r/OpenClaw} emphasizes execution guardrails and recovery (action-risk), while r/Moltbook} emphasizes identity, legitimacy, and accountability in public interaction (meaning-risk). The resulting distinction offers a portable lens for designing and evaluating oversight mechanisms that match agent role, rather than applying one-size-fits-all control policies.

### [7] [Measuring Dataset Diversity from a Geometric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09340)
*Yang Ba,Mohammad Sadeq Abolhasani,Michelle V Mancenido,Rong Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diversity metric based on topological data analysis (TDA) called PLDiv, which quantifies geometric features beyond entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diversity metrics focus on distributional variation or entropy but lack attention to geometric structure in datasets.

Method: A framework using topological data analysis and persistence landscapes (PLs) is developed to extract and quantify geometric features from datasets.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the PLDiv metric's effectiveness, reliability, and interpretability in linking data diversity to geometric properties.

Conclusion: The PLDiv metric enhances understanding and evaluation of dataset diversity, offering a novel tool for dataset construction and augmentation.

Abstract: Diversity can be broadly defined as the presence of meaningful variation across elements, which can be viewed from multiple perspectives, including statistical variation and geometric structural richness in the dataset. Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation.

### [8] [Auditing Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning Trees Outperforms Majority Vote and LLM-as-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09341)
*Wei Yang,Shixuan Li,Heng Ping,Peiyu Zhang,Paul Bogdan,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAuditor offers a novel approach for resolving reasoning conflicts in MAS by avoiding majority voting and using reasoning tree analysis, improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of majority voting in multi-agent systems, which fails in scenarios where agents converge through correlated biases on incorrect conclusions.

Method: The authors propose AgentAuditor, which employs path search within a Reasoning Tree for conflict resolution, along with Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO) to train adjudicators for improved minority-based selections.

Result: AgentAuditor demonstrated up to 5% improvement in accuracy over majority voting and 3% over LLM-as-Judge across multiple MAS settings.

Conclusion: The method advanced conflict resolution in multi-agent systems, showing promise for broader application and enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) can substantially extend the reasoning capacity of large language models (LLMs), yet most frameworks still aggregate agent outputs with majority voting. This heuristic discards the evidential structure of reasoning traces and is brittle under the confabulation consensus, where agents share correlated biases and converge on the same incorrect rationale. We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge.

*Michail S. Alexiou,J. Sukarno Mertoguno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formal reasoning wrapper to enhance the performance of machine learning toxicity detection systems against adversarial logic-based modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of cyberbullying in social media, characterized by toxic comments, requires enhanced detection and moderation systems due to vulnerabilities in existing statistical methods to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors introduce a formal reasoning wrapper to complement machine learning-based toxicity detection systems, utilizing it as both a pre-processing and post-processing step to counter adversarial logic-based modifications.

Result: Experimental evaluations on various machine learning models using a negation adversarial dataset demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and effectiveness when hybrid methods are employed.

Conclusion: Combining formal reasoning with machine learning offers a promising solution for more robust toxicity detection, addressing limitations in traditional statistical methods.

Abstract: The rise of cyberbullying in social media platforms involving toxic comments has escalated the need for effective ways to monitor and moderate online interactions. Existing solutions of automated toxicity detection systems, are based on a machine or deep learning algorithms. However, statistics-based solutions are generally prone to adversarial attacks that contain logic based modifications such as negation in phrases and sentences. In that regard, we present a set of formal reasoning-based methodologies that wrap around existing machine learning toxicity detection systems. Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring. We evaluate different variations of our wrapper on multiple machine learning models against a negation adversarial dataset. Experimental results highlight the improvement of hybrid (formal reasoning and machine-learning) methods against various purely statistical solutions.

*Jana G. Delfino,Jason L. Granstedt,Frank W. Samuelson,Robert Ochs,Krishna Juluru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI in radiology improves imaging but introduces potential risks. Awareness of its limitations can minimize these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid deployment of AI within radiology highlights its ability to enhance image quality and efficiency. However, its incorporation introduces risks related to information integrity and new failure modes.

Method: This paper communicates the importance of understanding AI's limitations in radiological image reconstruction and enhancement.

Result: The paper emphasizes awareness of challenges and risks associated with AI-enabled imaging technology.

Conclusion: Users can leverage AI benefits in radiology safely and effectively by understanding its limitations for image reconstruction and enhancement.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being deployed within radiology at a rapid pace. AI has proven an excellent tool for reconstructing and enhancing images that appear sharper, smoother, and more detailed, can be acquired more quickly, and allowing clinicians to review them more rapidly. However, incorporation of AI also introduces new failure modes and can exacerbate the disconnect between perceived quality of an image and information content of that image. Understanding the limitations of AI-enabled image reconstruction and enhancement is critical for safe and effective use of the technology. Hence, the purpose of this communication is to bring awareness to limitations when AI is used to reconstruct or enhance a radiological image, with the goal of enabling users to reap benefits of the technology while minimizing risks.

### [11] [P1-VL: Bridging Visual Perception and Scientific Reasoning in Physics Olympiads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09443)
*Yun Luo,Futing Wang,Qianjia Cheng,Fangchen Yu,Haodi Lei,Jianhao Yan,Chenxi Li,Jiacheng Chen,Yufeng Zhao,Haiyuan Wan,Yuchen Zhang,Shenghe Zheng,Junchi Yao,Qingyang Zhang,Haonan He,Wenxuan Zeng,Li Sheng,Chengxing Xie,Yuxin Zuo,Yizhuo Li,Yulun Wu,Rui Huang,Dongzhan Zhou,Kai Chen,Yu Qiao,Lei Bai,Yu Cheng,Ning Ding,Bowen Zhou,Peng Ye,Ganqu Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces P1-VL, an open-source vision-language model designed for advanced scientific reasoning, excelling in physics Olympiad challenges through multimodal grounding and progressive training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of bridging abstract logic with physical reality in scientific reasoning, specifically targeting physics problems requiring visual and logical integration.

Method: Develop P1-VL using Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for progressive training stability and Agentic Augmentation for iterative self-verification during inference.

Result: P1-VL-235B-A22B outperforms other open-source models, achieving 12 gold medals in physics Olympiads and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: P1-VL sets a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence, combining visual perception with abstract reasoning for scientific discovery, and is open-sourced to drive further development.

Abstract: The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.

### [12] [SpotAgent: Grounding Visual Geo-localization in Large Vision-Language Models through Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09463)
*Furong Jia,Ling Dai,Wenjin Deng,Fan Zhang,Chen Hu,Daxin Jiang,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpotAgent enhances geo-localization by combining advanced reasoning capabilities of LVLMs with tool-assisted verification, significantly improving accuracy in challenging real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with ambiguous and sparse visual cues in real-world geo-localization tasks, often leading to confident but incorrect predictions due to reliance on bounded internal knowledge.

Method: SpotAgent employs a structured agentic reasoning framework using external tools (e.g., maps, web search) and a 3-stage post-training pipeline involving Supervised Fine-Tuning, Multi-Agent Cold Start, and Reinforcement Learning with a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy.

Result: SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art geo-localization performance on standard benchmarks, significantly reducing hallucinations and enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: The tool-assisted and reasoning-based approach of SpotAgent effectively harnesses external resources to overcome the limitations of LVLMs in geo-localization, setting a new standard for precision and verification.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in geo-localization, yet they often struggle in real-world scenarios where visual cues are sparse, long-tailed, and highly ambiguous. Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating hallucinations while delivering precise and verifiable geo-localization.

### [13] [Bridging Efficiency and Transparency: Explainable CoT Compression in Multimodal Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09485)
*Yizhi Wang,Linan Yue,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces XMCC, a method to compress lengthy multimodal chains of thought while preserving reasoning integrity and providing explainable compression decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies caused by redundant reasoning steps in multimodal reasoning models while maintaining answer correctness and visual-textual alignment.

Method: The XMCC approach formulates compression as a sequential decision-making problem, optimized with reinforcement learning to retain key reasoning steps and generate natural-language explanations.

Result: XMCC significantly reduces reasoning length, preserves reasoning accuracy, and provides natural-language explanations, confirmed by experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: XMCC is effective in condensing chains of thought in multimodal reasoning while maintaining performance and offering transparency through explainable decisions.

Abstract: Long chains of thought (Long CoTs) are widely employed in multimodal reasoning models to tackle complex tasks by capturing detailed visual information. However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.

### [14] [Computing Conditional Shapley Values Using Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09489)
*Lars Henry Berge Olsen,Dennis Christensen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, for faster and efficient computation of Shapley values, showing competitive performance with reduced runtime for explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values are pivotal in AI explainability but are computationally demanding, especially when features are dependent. The paper addresses the challenge of using deep learning for efficient Shapley value computation.

Method: The authors leverage TabPFN's in-context learning capabilities to approximate conditional expectations without retraining, enabling efficient computation of Shapley values.

Result: TabPFN exhibits superior or marginally inferior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, with considerably reduced computational time.

Conclusion: TabPFN presents a promising solution for efficient Shapley value computation, outperforming or closely matching traditional methods, and future adaptations could enhance its utility in explainability tasks.

Abstract: Shapley values have become a cornerstone of explainable AI, but they are computationally expensive to use, especially when features are dependent. Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.

### [15] [Autoregressive Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09533)
*Masanari Oi,Mahiro Ukai,Masahiro Kaneko,Naoaki Okazaki,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Autoregressive DPO (ADPO) by revising preference optimization frameworks to better align large language models with human preferences, addressing foundational limitations in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in the foundational framework of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which assumes autoregressive properties only after deriving the objective function, potentially constraining its effectiveness for preference optimization.

Method: The authors rework DPO by integrating the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the Bradley-Terry model, resulting in a new variant called ADPO that modifies the DPO objective for better theoretical consistency.

Result: ADPO shifts the summation operation outside the log-sigmoid function in DPO objectives, providing a theoretically elegant loss formulation. Additionally, the paper introduces two length measures—token length and feedback length—enhancing the understanding of preference optimization in LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed ADPO offers a refined approach to DPO by explicitly addressing autoregressive modeling and length measures, improving preference optimization frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs.

*Martin Bauw*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting radar targets amidst clutter, waveform distortion, and proximity-induced interference. It proposes using partially complex-valued neural networks for adaptive processing of radar range profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar target detection methods struggle with issues like waveform distortion, clutter, and target proximity-induced detection difficulties. A more robust approach is needed for clear distinction and detection of targets.

Method: The study uses partially complex-valued neural networks to process radar range profiles containing multiple targets. Experiments with simulated datasets were carried out, comparing this neural network method with traditional pulse compression techniques.

Result: The neural network processes the entire received signal at once, creating a complete detection profile, whereas conventional pulse compression handles data one pulse length at a time.

Conclusion: Partially complex-valued neural networks show potential as an effective adaptive solution for detecting radar targets amidst challenges like distortion and proximity interferences.

Abstract: Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.

### [17] [FLINGO -- Instilling ASP Expressiveness into Linear Integer Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09620)
*Jorge Fandinno,Pedro Cabalar,Philipp Wanko,Torsten Schaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLINGO, a language and tool that enhances Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) by integrating ASP-like expressiveness into numerical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of CASP where ASP-like attributes such as defaults, undefined values, non-deterministic assignments, and aggregates are lost in numerical constraint representation.

Method: The authors develop the FLINGO language and tool, enabling richer expressiveness in constraints, and provide a translation mechanism to standard CASP programs in the CLINGCON format.

Result: The paper demonstrates the extended expressiveness of FLINGO through several examples, showing how it retains ASP-like features in CASP constraints.

Conclusion: FLINGO successfully integrates ASP-like expressiveness into CASP constraints, bridging a significant gap between the two paradigms.

Abstract: Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a hybrid paradigm that enriches Answer Set Programming (ASP) with numerical constraint processing, something required in many real-world applications. The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.

*Shiwei Lyu,Xidong Wang,Lei Liu,Hao Zhu,Chaohe Zhang,Jian Wang,Jinjie Gu,Benyou Wang,Yue Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HealthRubrics and HealthPrinciples to align large language model (LLM) outputs with clinician preferences, achieving superior performance and efficiency in medical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the difficulty of aligning LLM outputs with detailed clinician preferences and professional medical guidelines.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage framework: creating HealthRubrics (clinician-verified examples) and distilling them into HealthPrinciples (a set of reusable clinical alignment principles).

Result: A smaller model (30B parameter with 3B activated) trained using these methods outperformed larger models like Deepseek-R1 and o3 on specific medical alignment benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLM's capacity to meet clinical alignment efficiently and establishes a scalable method for medical reasoning development.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge, aligning their open-ended outputs with fine-grained clinician preferences remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights limitations of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), introducing GHS-TDA to enhance reasoning accuracy in language models via global hypothesis graphs and topological data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address reasoning errors and instability in existing Chain-of-Thought methods, aiming to improve accuracy, consistency, and interpretability.

Method: GHS-TDA integrates global hypothesis graphs for error correction and topological data analysis to extract stable reasoning structures.

Result: GHS-TDA improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across benchmarks while providing interpretable reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Joint utilization of reasoning diversity and topological stability enables self-adaptive reasoning, outperforming other baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

### [20] [Symbolic Pattern Temporal Numeric Planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09798)
*Matteo Cardellini,Enrico Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach to temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs), offering improvements in temporal planning and demonstrating state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in temporal planning with ICEs, where actions and constraints occur over time, building on the previously proposed SPP framework to handle these complexities.

Method: The authors extended the SPP approach by incorporating the ability to manage durative actions and ICEs in temporal planning. They also developed a planner called Patty to implement and evaluate their approach.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed planner Patty performs better than existing planners in most temporal domains without ICEs, matches state-of-the-art planning results in domains with ICEs, and outperforms other planners in a new real-world-inspired domain.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the extended SPP approach and the planner Patty are effective for temporal planning, particularly in handling ICEs, outperforming many state-of-the-art planners across different scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, a Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach was proposed for numeric planning where a pattern (i.e., a finite sequence of actions) suggests a causal order between actions. The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.

### [21] [Would a Large Language Model Pay Extra for a View? Inferring Willingness to Pay from Subjective Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09802)
*Manon Reusens,Sofie Goethals,Toon Calders,David Martens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines Large Language Models (LLMs) in subjective decision-making for travel assistance by comparing their willingness to pay (WTP) estimates with human benchmarks. Findings indicate both capabilities and systematic deviations in LLM responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how LLMs handle subjective decision-making when deployed in real-world settings, like travel assistance, where no objectively correct answers exist.

Method: The study uses multinomial logit models to analyze LLM responses to choice dilemmas, deriving implied WTP values and comparing them to human benchmarks. It also examines variations in LLM behavior with added user-specific information and persona-based prompts.

Result: Large LLMs produce meaningful WTP values but systematically deviate at attribute levels and overestimate human WTP, especially with expensive options or business-geared personas. Conditioning models on cheaper preferences improves alignment with benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for subjective decision support but exhibit limitations. Careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation are critical for their practical deployment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.

### [22] [Efficient Unsupervised Environment Design through Hierarchical Policy Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09813)
*Dexun Li,Sidney Tio,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to improve unsupervised environment design (UED) by reducing teacher-student interactions required in resource-constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UED methods rely heavily on stochastic processes for generating an infinite number of environments for curriculum training, which is impractical in scenarios where teacher-student interactions are resource-intensive.

Method: The hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced. It uses student policy representations for generating training environments and incorporates a generative model to augment the teacher's dataset with synthetic data to limit teacher-student interactions.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms baseline UED approaches across different domains while significantly reducing the required interactions between the teacher and student during training.

Conclusion: This approach is effective for resource-constrained environments and improves the efficiency of UED methods without compromising performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) has emerged as a promising approach to developing general-purpose agents through automated curriculum generation. Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.

*Taeyoon Kim,Woohyeok Park,Hoyeong Yun,Kyungyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the failure patterns of LLM-based Root Cause Analysis (RCA) agents in cloud systems, proposing a taxonomy of pitfalls and strategies to reduce failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of failures in cloud systems that lead to financial losses by improving automated RCA processes using LLMs, as existing systems have low detection accuracy and limited evaluation frameworks.

Method: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of 1,675 RCA agent runs across five LLM models using the OpenRCA benchmark. Failures were classified into 12 pitfall types affecting reasoning, communication, and interaction, and mitigation strategies were explored.

Result: Findings reveal persistent pitfalls like hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, originating from shared agent architecture rather than model capability. Improved inter-agent communication reduced failures by 15 percentage points.

Conclusion: The research provides a taxonomy and diagnostic approach to design more dependable autonomous RCA agents for large-scale cloud systems, emphasizing that architectural changes, rather than prompt engineering, are needed to improve outcomes.

Abstract: Failures in large-scale cloud systems incur substantial financial losses, making automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) essential for operational stability. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.

*Jinsong Liu,Yuhang Jiang,Ramayya Krishnan,Rema Padman,Yiye Zhang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a method improving clinical agents by identifying and learning from discrepancies in reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing clinical decision support systems that have not only accurate answers but also enhanced reasoning fidelity.

Method: The DRL framework analyzes reasoning graphs from agents and reference rationales, diagnoses discrepancies using graph edit distance, and enhances prompts with reasoning corrections through Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Result: DRL improves both accuracy and reasoning fidelity in medical QA tasks and prediction tasks, verified through evaluations and clinicians' review.

Conclusion: DRL contributes to reliable clinical decision-making in complex scenarios, and its efficiency makes it deployable under restricted token budgets.

Abstract: Clinical decision support requires not only correct answers but also clinically valid reasoning. We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.

*Junda Wang,Zhichao Yang,Dongxu Zhang,Sanjit Singh Batra,Robert E. Tillman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the ESTAR technique, enabling reasoning models to reduce redundant computations and improve efficiency while retaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models generate lengthy reasoning chains for high performance, leading to computational redundancies when the correct answer is already found.

Method: ESTAR integrates a trajectory-based classifier, supervised fine-tuning for self-generated stop signals, and stop-aware reinforcement learning to reduce reasoning length effectively.

Result: On four datasets, ESTAR reduced reasoning sequences by 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) without significant accuracy loss (74.9% vs. 74.2%) and demonstrated robust cross-domain application.

Conclusion: Early-stopping mechanisms like ESTAR offer significant efficiency improvements in reasoning models while maintaining their performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance by generating long chains-of-thought, but often waste computation on redundant reasoning after the correct answer has already been reached. We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization. These results highlight early stopping as a simple yet powerful mechanism for improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology for improving language models' reasoning capabilities in physics-based environments, focusing on coarse-grained pattern discovery within simulation logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of language models in physical reasoning due to their reliance on observational data instead of simulation grounding, while enabling natural language guidance for AI agents.

Method: The approach involves synthesizing programs that analyze simulation logs to identify high-level physical patterns, facilitating natural language interactions with the environment.

Result: The new annotated representation improves language models' comprehension and reasoning in physical systems, demonstrated through two physics benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enhances language models' ability to generate reward programs aligned with natural language goals for planning and supervised learning purposes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents embedded in environments with physics-based interaction face many challenges including reasoning, planning, summarization, and question answering. This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chain of Mindset (CoM), a framework enhancing language models' reasoning by employing adaptive mindset orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models consistently apply a fixed cognitive 'mindset' across reasoning steps, limiting their problem-solving capabilities and preventing further intelligence improvements.

Method: The authors propose a framework called Chain of Mindset (CoM) which incorporates four distinct cognitive mindsets, dynamically selected by a Meta-Agent during problem-solving, and ensures efficiency via a bidirectional Context Gate.

Result: CoM achieved state-of-the-art results on mathematical, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing baselines by 4.96\% and 4.72\% accuracy on specific models.

Conclusion: Chain of Mindset (CoM) successfully addresses the limitations of fixed mindsets in existing LLMs, improving adaptive problem-solving and model efficiency.

Abstract: Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\% and 4.72\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CODE-SHARP, a framework for open-ended skill discovery using foundation models to build hierarchical reward programs, outperforming existing approaches significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the problem of open-ended skill discovery without relying on predefined hand-designed reward functions, which are infeasible for unknown tasks.

Method: The method involves the creation of the CODE-SHARP framework, which uses Foundation Models to form a hierarchical skill graph of executable reward functions and trains goal-conditioned agents using these functions.

Result: Agents trained using this framework outperform pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over 134%, successfully solving complex and long-horizon tasks in the Craftax environment.

Conclusion: The proposed CODE-SHARP framework significantly advances open-ended skill learning and task-solving capabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness and promise for broader applications in Artificial Intelligence.

Abstract: Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos $\href{https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage}{here}$.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent World Model (AWM), a synthetic environment generation pipeline aimed to scale agent training effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of large language models requires scalable environments for agent training, which current methods lack due to limitations in diversity and reliability.

Method: The authors develop AWM, a pipeline generating 1,000 synthetic, code-driven environments with rich tooling and database integration for efficient agent interaction and reliable transitions.

Result: They demonstrate that agent training in these synthetic environments yields strong out-of-distribution generalization across benchmarks and facilitates reliable reward functions.

Conclusion: AWM provides a scalable and effective solution for training autonomous agents in diverse setups, enhancing generalization beyond benchmark-specific environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

TL;DR: This paper showcases the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to help accelerate the design process for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) hardware accelerators, specifically for the FALCON digital signature scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-quantum cryptography algorithms are complex and computationally demanding, making efficient hardware implementation challenging. The authors aim to address this problem by using LLMs to streamline the hardware-software co-design process.

Method: A novel LLM-driven framework was developed to analyze PQC algorithms, identify critical components for performance, and generate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. Quantitative comparisons were conducted between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based methods.

Result: LLM-driven accelerators showed up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths compared to conventional methods, but with trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly reduce design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, marking a promising new approach for fast and adaptive PQC hardware design.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing data against emerging quantum threats. However, its algorithms are computationally complex and difficult to implement efficiently on hardware. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.

*Thomas Benz*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in meeting rapidly growing computational demands in industries driven by machine learning while addressing energy-efficiency and heterogeneous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address increasing computational demands and design challenges in energy-efficient and heterogeneous industrial systems driven by ACES.

Method: Proposes a co-design approach for memory systems alongside compute units and accelerators tailored to industrial applications.

Result: The study emphasizes the critical role of memory bandwidth, energy efficiency, and system heterogeneity in adapting to ACES requirements.

Conclusion: Carefully planned co-design of memory systems is essential for meeting performance and energy demands in future industrial domains relying on ACES technologies.

Abstract: Industrial domains such as automotive, robotics, and aerospace are rapidly evolving to satisfy the increasing demand for machine-learning-driven Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared mobility (ACES). This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators.

### [33] [Measuring Inclusion in Interaction: Inclusion Analytics for Human-AI Collaborative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09269)
*Jaeyoon Choi,Nia Nixon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'inclusion analytics,' a framework to evaluate inclusion dynamically in collaborative problem solving (CPS) rather than relying on general or post-hoc evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods of assessing inclusion in educational and AI contexts, which often miss the real-time dynamics shaping collaborative problem solving.

Method: The paper develops 'inclusion analytics,' a framework based on three dimensions: participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity. It uses scalable, interaction-based measures to analyze these constructs, validated through simulated conversations and human-AI teaming data.

Result: Illustrates how the framework identifies subtle patterns of inclusion, such as participation dynamics and idea uptake, that are hidden in traditional assessment methods.

Conclusion: The work advances process-focused, interactional approaches for analyzing inclusion in human-AI collaboration and contributes to monitoring and fostering equitable environments dynamically.

Abstract: Inclusion, equity, and access are widely valued in AI and education, yet are often assessed through coarse sample descriptors or post-hoc self-reports that miss how inclusion is shaped moment by moment in collaborative problem solving (CPS). In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce inclusion analytics, a discourse-based framework for examining inclusion as a dynamic, interactional process in CPS. We conceptualize inclusion along three complementary dimensions -- participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity -- and demonstrate how these constructs can be made analytically visible using scalable, interaction-level measures. Using both simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments, we illustrate how inclusion analytics can surface patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that remain invisible to aggregate or post-hoc evaluations. This work represents an initial step toward process-oriented approaches to measuring inclusion in human-AI collaborative learning environments.

### [34] [Effective Reasoning Chains Reduce Intrinsic Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09276)
*Archiki Prasad,Mandar Joshi,Kenton Lee,Mohit Bansal,Peter Shaw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies intrinsic dimensionality as a key metric for evaluating reasoning chain effectiveness in language models, observing an inverse correlation with generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the mechanisms through which reasoning chains improve language model performance on complex tasks.

Method: The researchers fixed the model architecture and varied task formulations using different reasoning strategies to measure intrinsic dimensionality and its relationship to generalization.

Result: Effective reasoning strategies were found to consistently reduce intrinsic dimensionality, strongly correlating with improved generalization on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: Reducing intrinsic dimensionality through reasoning strategies enables efficient task compression, enhancing generalization, and offers a new metric for analyzing reasoning processes.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and its variants have substantially improved the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks, yet the precise mechanisms by which different strategies facilitate generalization remain poorly understood. While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering a new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes.

*Shu-Ting Pi,Pradeep Bagavan,Yejia Li,Disha,Qun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model to improve topic continuity in chatbot conversations using Large Language Models, leveraging attention mechanisms and a transformed NLU model with interpretable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abrupt topic shifts in chatbot interactions lead to poor user experiences and inefficient computational use, motivating the need for ensuring topic continuity in conversations.

Method: A model based on expanding natural language understanding (NLU) using a Naive Bayes approach, integrating an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity for better topic alignment detection.

Result: The proposed model successfully handles conversations of any length with linear time complexity and excels in identifying topic continuity, outperforming traditional methods in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The model enhances chatbot interactions by enabling responsible and interpretable use of LLMs while improving topic alignment in lengthy discussions.

Abstract: Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) as chatbots in diverse business scenarios often presents the challenge of maintaining topic continuity. Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs.

### [36] [Beyond Uniform Credit: Causal Credit Assignment for Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09331)
*Mykola Khandoga,Rui Yuan,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Counterfactual Importance Weighting to enhance reasoning spans in language model updates, improving performance with faster convergence and better token prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods often assign uniform credit to tokens during training, which fails to distinguish critical reasoning steps from filler text.

Method: Counterfactual importance weighting measures importance based on reasoning span masking and uses the model's probability shifts to adjust token weights during policy updates.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K across multiple models show improvements over uniform baselines in accuracy and convergence speed. Reversed importance weightings confirmed genuine causal understanding.

Conclusion: Counterfactual Importance Weighting appears promising for reasoning structure prioritization in language models and sets the stage for future research in this area.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods for language model reasoning, such as GRPO and DAPO, assign uniform credit to all generated tokens - the filler phrase "Let me think" receives the same gradient update as the critical calculation "23 + 45 = 68." We propose counterfactual importance weighting: mask reasoning spans, measure the drop in answer probability, and upweight tokens accordingly during policy gradient updates. Our method requires no auxiliary models or external annotation, instead importance is estimated directly from the policy model's own probability shifts. Experiments on GSM8K across three models spanning the Qwen and Llama families demonstrate consistent improvements over uniform baselines and faster convergence to equivalent accuracy. Inverting the importance signal hurts performance, confirming we capture genuine causal structure rather than noise. Analysis shows the method correctly prioritizes calculation steps over scaffolding text. We view these findings as establishing counterfactual importance weighting as a foundation for further research rather than a complete solution.

### [37] [FM SO.P: A Progressive Task Mixture Framework with Automatic Evaluation for Cross-Domain SOP Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09336)
*Siyuan Huang,Ziyu Wang,Chao Pan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FM SO.P, a solution to improve language model understanding of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) using task-based training and a novel evaluation system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language models struggle with understanding and generalizing SOPs across domains due to challenges in terminology precision, sequential reasoning, and constraint logic.

Method: FM SO.P employs progressive task mixtures, emphasizing three stages (concept disambiguation, action sequence reasoning, and scenario-specific graph reasoning) and introduces a multi-agent evaluation system for adaptive rubric generation and scoring.

Result: On SOPBench, FM SO.P achieves a 48.3% pass rate with a 32B model and 34.3% with an open-source 7B model, matching larger models like Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FM SO.P addresses SOP challenges effectively and demonstrates strong performance with a smaller model, highlighting efficiency and advancement in procedural understanding for NLP models.

Abstract: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are critical for enterprise operations, yet existing language models struggle with SOP understanding and cross-domain generalization. Current methods fail because joint training cannot differentiate between reasoning capabilities that SOP requires: terminology precision, sequential ordering, and constraint reasoning. We propose FM SO.P, solving these challenges through two novelties. First, we introduce progressive task mixtures that build capabilities by stages across three task types with cumulative data: concept disambiguation for terminology precision, action sequence understanding for procedural correctness, and scenario-aware graph reasoning for conditional logic. Second, we propose an automatic multi-agent evaluation system consisting of three agents that adaptively generate rubrics, stratified test sets, and rubric scoring, adapting to domains (e.g., temporal constraints for DMV, regulatory compliance for banking). Evaluated on SOPBench across seven domains (Bank, DMV, Healthcare, Market, University, Library, Hotel), FM SO.P achieves 48.3\% pass rate with our 32B model and 34.3\% with our opensource 7B model, matching Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct baseline (34.4\%) with 10x fewer parameters.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies user experiences and psychological risks associated with AI systems, analyzing real-world data from Reddit posts to understand themes and emotional patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI systems becoming more common in daily life, understanding the psychological risks and user experiences associated with AI usage is crucial for safety research and governance.

Method: The authors analyzed Reddit posts using computational thematic analysis, applying Braun and Clarke's framework with multi-agent and LLM-assisted methods. Emotion labeling was done using a BERT-based classifier to characterize affective patterns.

Result: The study identified five experiential dimensions and 14 thematic categories of AI psychological risks. Self-regulation difficulties and fear related to autonomy and technical risks were prevalent in user discussions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight real-world perceptions of AI safety and deepen empirical knowledge on psychological risks from AI systems. The research provides a foundation for improving AI governance and user safety frameworks.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly embedded in everyday life, yet empirical understanding of how psychological risk associated with AI use emerges, is experienced, and is regulated by users remains limited. We present a large-scale computational thematic analysis of posts collected between 2023 and 2025 from two Reddit communities, r/AIDangers and r/ChatbotAddiction, explicitly focused on AI-related harm and distress. Using a multi-agent, LLM-assisted thematic analysis grounded in Braun and Clarke's reflexive framework, we identify 14 recurring thematic categories and synthesize them into five higher-order experiential dimensions. To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk. These results provide early empirical evidence from lived user experience of how AI safety is perceived and emotionally experienced outside laboratory or speculative contexts, offering a foundation for future AI safety research, evaluation, and responsible governance.

### [39] [Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish: Evidence from Lexical Variation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09346)
*Yoshifumi Kawasaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how well Large Language Models (LLMs) understand geographic lexical variation in Spanish, analyzing responses across 21 Spanish-speaking regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need to understand LLMs' capacity to handle the rich dialectal diversity of Spanish, this study investigates their ability to represent geographic lexical variations.

Method: The research employed two question formats (Yes-No and multiple-choice), leveraging an expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation covering over 900 items from 21 regions.

Result: LLMs showed systematic performance differences, accurately identifying variations in Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River regions but struggling with Chilean Spanish. Results indicate factors beyond digital resource volume influence accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide a fine-grained understanding of LLMs' dialectal knowledge, highlighting linguistic biases and contributing to discussions on Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.

Abstract: This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) capture geographic lexical variation in Spanish, a language that exhibits substantial regional variation. Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.

### [40] [Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Part-of-Speech Tagging with Monolingual Corpora Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09366)
*Jianyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised cross-lingual POS tagging framework using monolingual corpora and an UNMT system, achieving competitive results for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data limits POS tagging for low-resource languages, and parallel corpora required by existing methods are often unavailable.

Method: They use an unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) system to generate pseudo-parallel corpora from monolingual data, followed by POS tag projection and a proposed multi-source projection technique.

Result: Their framework achieves results comparable to, or better than, baseline methods using parallel corpora for certain languages, with an average performance boost of 1.3% with multi-source projection.

Conclusion: This approach provides an effective alternative for POS tagging in low-resource languages, particularly when parallel corpora are inaccessible, highlighting the benefits of leveraging monolingual data.

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data, existing studies on low-resource languages typically adopt unsupervised approaches for POS tagging. Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods.

*Zexu Sun,Bokai Ji,Hengyi Cai,Shuaiqiang Wang,Lei Wang,Guangxia Li,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentSkiller is an automated framework to generate high-quality multi-turn interaction data in diverse contexts, enabling large language models to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of high-quality, diverse, and long-horizon interaction data that hinders large language models from reaching generalist intelligence.

Method: The framework employs a DAG architecture for state transitions, builds detailed domain ontologies, defines tool interfaces, and ensures consistency with databases and domain policies. It synthesizes cross-domain tasks and validates them using execution-based criteria and Persona-based simulation.

Result: AgentSkiller generated approximately 11K interaction samples, demonstrating improved function-calling performance, especially in models with larger parameter sizes.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable solution for synthesizing realistic multi-turn interaction data, improving large language model capabilities in multi-domain and complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents demonstrate potential in solving real-world problems via tools, yet generalist intelligence is bottlenecked by scarce high-quality, long-horizon data. Existing methods collect privacy-constrained API logs or generate scripted interactions lacking diversity, which struggle to produce data requisite for scaling capabilities. We propose AgentSkiller, a fully automated framework synthesizing multi-turn interaction data across realistic, semantically linked domains. It employs a DAG-based architecture with explicit state transitions to ensure determinism and recoverability. The pipeline builds a domain ontology and Person-Centric Entity Graph, defines tool interfaces via Service Blueprints for Model Context Protocol servers, and populates environments with consistent databases and strict Domain Policies. A cross-domain fusion mechanism links services to simulate complex tasks. Finally, the pipeline creates user tasks by verifying solution paths, filtering via execution-based validation, and generating queries using a Persona-based Simulator for automated rollout. This produces reliable environments with clear state changes. To demonstrate effectiveness, we synthesized $\approx$ 11K interaction samples; experimental results indicate that models trained on this dataset achieve significant improvements on function calling over baselines, particularly in larger parameter regimes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AfriNLLB, lightweight, efficient translation models for African languages, supporting 15 language pairs with bidirectional translations. The models are comparable to baselines but faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, high-performing translation models for African languages in resource-limited settings.

Method: The method involves compressing NLLB-200 600M models using iterative pruning and quantization, fine-tuning with curated parallel corpora, and utilizing knowledge distillation from larger models.

Result: AfriNLLB models achieve performance on par with baseline models but with considerably improved computational efficiency. Two model versions (Transformers and CTranslate2) and training data are released.

Conclusion: AfriNLLB facilitates accessible and efficient translation for African languages, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments, and promotes further research.

Abstract: In this work, we present AfriNLLB, a series of lightweight models for efficient translation from and into African languages. AfriNLLB supports 15 language pairs (30 translation directions), including Swahili, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Somali, Zulu, Lingala, Afrikaans, Wolof, and Egyptian Arabic, as well as other African Union official languages such as Arabic (MSA), French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Our training data covers bidirectional translation between English and 13 languages, and between French and two languages (Lingala and Wolof).
  AfriNLLB models are based on NLLB-200 600M, which we compress using iterative layer pruning and quantization. We fine-tune the pruned models on parallel corpora we curated for African languages, employing knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our work aims at enabling efficient deployment of translation models for African languages in resource-constrained settings.
  Our evaluation results demonstrate that AfriNLLB models achieve performance comparable to the baseline while being significantly faster. We release two versions of the AfriNLLB models, a Transformers version that allows further fine-tuning and a CTranslate2 version for efficient inference. Moreover, we release all the training data that we used for fine-tuning the baseline and pruned models to facilitate further research.

*Peng Lai,Zhihao Ou,Yong Wang,Longyue Wang,Jian Yang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiasScope and JudgeBench-Pro to address and mitigate unknown biases in LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of robustness and reliability in LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations by systematically exploring unknown biases.

Method: Proposes BiasScope, an automated framework for discovering potential biases, and introduces JudgeBench-Pro, an enhanced benchmark to test evaluation robustness.

Result: BiasScope successfully identifies biases across models, and JudgeBench-Pro demonstrates high error rates in LLM evaluations, revealing the need for improved robustness.

Conclusion: Automated exploration through BiasScope significantly improves the identification of biases, and JudgeBench-Pro highlights the urgency to enhance LLM evaluation methods.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted across various research and practical applications, yet the robustness and reliability of its evaluation remain a critical issue. A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.

### [44] [Contractual Deepfakes: Can Large Language Models Generate Contracts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09384)
*Eliza Mik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the idea that LLMs can effectively draft legal contracts, highlighting their inability to understand context, reason, or accurately tailor documents to specific legal needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overoptimistic beliefs that LLMs can replace legal professionals by drafting effective legal contracts, while emphasizing the limitations of these models in legal applications.

Method: The paper critiques the capabilities of LLMs in drafting contracts by analyzing their reliance on approximating word patterns rather than understanding context or reasoning.

Result: The paper finds that while LLMs can produce generic contractual documents, such outputs are often inconsistent, unsuitable, or ineffective for specific transactions.

Conclusion: LLMs do not currently pose a credible threat to the legal industry, as their limitations prevent them from replacing meaningful legal reasoning and precise drafting required in law.

Abstract: Notwithstanding their unprecedented ability to generate text, LLMs do not understand the meaning of words, have no sense of context and cannot reason. Their output constitutes an approximation of statistically dominant word patterns. And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry.

*Jianyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extend multilingual pre-trained language models to low-resource languages by expanding the vocabulary and leveraging bilingual dictionaries, demonstrating improved performance in linguistic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of high-resource bias in existing multilingual pre-trained language models and extend support to low-resource languages previously unsupported.

Method: Expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus, remove biased vocabulary, use bilingual dictionaries for initialization, and continue pre-training the model.

Result: The approach improves POS tagging and NER tasks by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively, while maintaining the model's performance on the source language.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances mPLMs for low-resource languages and maintains the robustness of the model's performance across languages.

Abstract: Multilingual pre-trained language models(mPLMs) offer significant benefits for many low-resource languages. To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore if LLMs' moral preferences are stable or they, like humans, are influenced by morally irrelevant contexts, due to the increasing use of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Method: The researchers curated a multimodal dataset with 'moral distractors' from emotionally-valenced images and narratives, injecting these into standard moral benchmarks and analyzing their impact on LLM outcomes.

Result: Incorporating 'moral distractors' caused over a 30% change in LLMs' moral judgments even in clear situations, demonstrating susceptibility to external irrelevant factors.

Conclusion: LLMs require more context-aware moral evaluation systems and refined cognitive models to improve their reliability in moral decision-making.

Abstract: With the rapid development and uptake of large language models (LLMs) across high-stakes settings, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs behave in ways that align with human values. Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this "situationist" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 "moral distractors" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.

### [47] [Breaking the Pre-Sampling Barrier: Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09438)
*Taewoong Yoon,Geunyeong Jeong,Geon Park,Sihyeong Yeom,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC), a method to enhance Large Language Model inference efficiency by leveraging internal neuron activation signals for difficulty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to address the inefficiencies in the Self-Consistency (SC) decoding method for Large Language Models, which improves accuracy but suffers from high inference costs. Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) aided this but introduced its own computational burdens.

Method: The proposed ACTSC method uses neuron activation patterns within the feed-forward network to estimate problem difficulty, eliminating pre-sampling and additional computational overhead. This probe adjusts SC sampling dynamically for new datasets.

Result: Experimental validation on five benchmarks indicates that ACTSC minimizes inference costs while maintaining comparable accuracy to other methods.

Conclusion: ACTSC addresses computational inefficiencies in SC by leveraging internal model signals, offering a lightweight and effective solution for difficulty-aware inference.

Abstract: Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods.

### [48] [Evaluating Social Bias in RAG Systems: When External Context Helps and Reasoning Hurts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09442)
*Shweta Parihar,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the presence and reduction of social biases in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, revealing that external context in RAG reduces bias but Chain-of-Thought (CoT) integration increases it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social biases in large language models cause fairness issues, and the study seeks to understand whether RAG architectures can mitigate these biases and explore the role of reasoning methods like CoT.

Method: The authors conducted extensive experiments using different retrieval corpora, language models, and bias evaluation datasets, studying over 13 bias types. They tested RAG's effectiveness and integrated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to evaluate performance and bias trade-offs.

Result: RAG reduces bias due to the inclusion of external context, which diversifies grounding for outputs. CoT improves accuracy but paradoxically increases bias across datasets.

Conclusion: External grounding in RAG can counter stereotype-driven predictions and improve fairness. However, integrating CoT reasoning requires bias-aware frameworks to address the trade-off between accuracy and bias in outputs.

Abstract: Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.

### [49] [Conceptual Cultural Index: A Metric for Cultural Specificity via Relative Generality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09444)
*Takumi Ohashi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI) for evaluating cultural specificity at the sentence level, demonstrating its effectiveness over direct language model scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To devise a systematic and interpretable method to evaluate cultural specificity in multicultural settings, which remains underexplored in existing large language models.

Method: The Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI) is calculated by comparing the generality estimate of a sentence within the target culture to the average generality estimate across other cultures. This allows for culture scope control and interpretability through generality estimates.

Result: The validation on 400 sentences shows CCI's consistent and anticipated score distribution for culture-specific and general sentences. CCI also achieves over a 10-point improvement in AUC compared to direct LLM scoring for models tailored to the target culture.

Conclusion: CCI effectively quantifies cultural specificity in sentences, offering better interpretability and performance than direct language model scoring, making it a useful tool in multicultural contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture. Our code is available at https://github.com/IyatomiLab/CCI .

Abstract: Extracting drug use information from unstructured Electronic Health Records remains a major challenge in clinical Natural Language Processing. While Large Language Models demonstrate advancements, their use in clinical NLP is limited by concerns over trust, control, and efficiency. To address this, we present NOWJ submission to the ToxHabits Shared Task at BioCreative IX. This task targets the detection of toxic substance use and contextual attributes in Spanish clinical texts, a domain-specific, low-resource setting. We propose a multi-output ensemble system tackling both Subtask 1 - ToxNER and Subtask 2 - ToxUse. Our system integrates BETO with a CRF layer for sequence labeling, employs diverse training strategies, and uses sentence filtering to boost precision. Our top run achieved 0.94 F1 and 0.97 precision for Trigger Detection, and 0.91 F1 for Argument Detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CoCoA and CoCoA-SIG decoders to enhance the factual correctness of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) by addressing their tendency to generate factually incorrect outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the factual reliability of LLMs by addressing their tendency to generate hallucinated or factually incorrect text, particularly in tasks like question-answering, summarization, and code generation.

Method: The proposed CoCoA decoding algorithm evaluates the representational instability within the model's internal layers during inference to penalize outputs with high confusion, encouraging more factually grounded outputs. Additionally, CoCoA-SIG incorporates a dynamic penalty targeting surprise and instability.

Result: Experiments across multiple domains and model families show that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness without retraining, making it widely applicable.

Conclusion: The CoCoA approach effectively reduces hallucinations in LLMs and improves their factual reliability by leveraging intrinsic model signals during inference, thus enhancing their trustworthiness.

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.

*Hikaru Asano,Tadashi Kozuno,Kuniaki Saito,Yukino Baba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, focusing on optimizing token prediction, while this paper introduces an oracle unmasking order to enhance reasoning benchmarks and a supervised planner to mimic the method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve the inferencing process of MDLMs by optimizing the order of filling masked positions, as typical methods rely on heuristics or costly reinforcement learning, limiting overall performance in logical reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduce and utilize Gt-Margin, an oracle ordering metric based on ground-truth token margins, followed by training a supervised unmasking planner using learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle unmasking order.

Result: Gt-Margin as an oracle unmasking order showed improved generation quality, especially in logical reasoning tasks. The supervised unmasking planner improves reasoning accuracy upon integration with MDLM sampling.

Conclusion: By prioritizing positions based on oracle scoring and training a learning-to-rank planner, inference in MDLMs can achieve better reasoning accuracy without altering the token predictor itself.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EcoGym, a benchmark for testing long-horizon decision-making of LLM-based agents in interactive economic scenarios. EcoGym consists of three environments and evaluates outcomes based on business-relevant metrics over extended periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current short-term, domain-specific evaluation frameworks and provide a persistent framework for assessing LLM-based agents in long-horizon decision-making within economic contexts.

Method: Development of a benchmark named EcoGym that includes three diverse environments (Vending, Freelance, and Operation) designed for continuous planning with standardized processes and extended evaluation timelines over 1000+ steps.

Result: Experiments with eleven leading LLMs showed varying performance across scenarios, revealing significant inadequacies in high-level strategies and action execution efficiency.

Conclusion: EcoGym offers a transparent, extensible testbed for evaluating long-term strategies and decision-making in realistic economic environments, enabling further study on controllability versus utility in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.

TL;DR: The paper identifies Knowledge Integration Decay (KID) as a limitation in LLMs' reasoning and proposes a method, SAKE, to improve knowledge integration and performance by stabilizing knowledge utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the Knowledge Integration Decay (KID) problem in LLMs, where models struggle to consistently integrate retrieved external knowledge into long chains of reasoning, limiting their performance.

Method: The authors propose the SAKE (Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding) method, a training-free, inference-time strategy that anchors retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of reasoning, preserving its semantic integrity and optimizing its utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SAKE successfully mitigates the KID problem, improves knowledge integration, and enhances performance, particularly on multi-hop question answering and complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SAKE is an effective and lightweight solution for stabilizing knowledge utilization in LLMs, addressing the bottleneck of Knowledge Integration Decay (KID) and improving their reasoning capabilities without additional training.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method called Preference-Modulated & Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) and introduces the framework Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM) to improve multi-objective alignment in LLMs. It minimizes feature entanglement and enables precise trade-offs between human preference objectives during test-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limitations of existing multi-objective alignment techniques for LLMs, which often fail to account for the interplay between different preference objectives, causing misalignment in output generation.

Method: The authors introduce MoSLoRA, which consists of a shared preference-agnostic module and a preference modulation module using affine transformations conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This method is incorporated into the UniARM framework, which jointly models all preferences within a unified parameter space.

Result: The proposed methods effectively mitigate feature entanglement and allow for accurate preference trade-offs in LLM outputs, improving overall alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MoSLoRA and UniARM offer a cost-effective and precise solution for aligning LLM outputs with multiple human preference objectives, enhancing their usability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for multi-turn conversational question answering across eight datasets, revealing that simpler methods often outperform complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and benchmarking RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, considering dialogue complexities such as history and shifting user intents.

Method: The authors conducted a unified experimental setup evaluating vanilla and advanced RAG methods using retrieval and generation metrics across diverse conversational datasets.

Result: Robust yet straightforward methods like reranking and hybrid BM25 consistently outperform vanilla RAG, while some advanced techniques degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline.

Conclusion: Effective multi-turn conversational RAG does not rely on methodological complexity but rather alignment between retrieval methods and specific dataset structures.

Abstract: Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Klejda-A/exp-rag.git}{GitHub Repository}}

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive methods for test-time scaling of Block Diffusion Language Models (BDLMs) to improve decoding speed and accuracy during complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BDLMs show strong scalability and reasoning capabilities but face challenges in decoding speed and effectiveness, especially for long Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a dynamic denoising strategy based on model confidence, and Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), which adjusts block sizes for exploratory and refinement processes. Progressive Block Size Extension is used for mitigating degradation during scaling.

Result: Experiments using BACD and TCCF on TDAR-8B lead to 2.26x speedup and a notable +11.2-point improvement on AIME24 benchmark over existing TraDo-8B models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances BDLMs' efficiency and accuracy during test-time scaling, paving the way for improved application in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual legal corpus, and fine-tunes multilingual models to improve semantic retrieval in multilingual legal environments, especially for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance legal information retrieval in multilingual contexts by addressing limitations in domain-adapted models and improving semantic retrieval from noisy, PDF-based legislative documents.

Method: The authors created LEMUR, a legal corpus constructed from EUR-Lex documents across 25 languages, and fine-tuned multilingual embedding models using contrastive learning for monolingual and bilingual retrieval tasks.

Result: Fine-tuning consistently improved retrieval accuracy, especially for low-resource languages, and demonstrated transferable cross-lingual enhancements.

Conclusion: Legal-domain specific fine-tuning enhances multilingual and cross-lingual legal information retrieval, addressing prior challenges in noisy text extraction and domain adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to access legal information. Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Budget-Guided MCTS (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that adapts to dynamic token budgets for effective use in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tree-search policies do not handle varying token budgets effectively, leading to inefficiencies in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes BG-MCTS, which dynamically adjusts its search strategy based on remaining token budgets, moving from broad exploration to focused answer refinement and avoiding late-stage inefficiencies.

Result: BG-MCTS demonstrates superior performance compared to budget-agnostic baselines on MATH500 and AIME24/25 using open-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: BG-MCTS aligns tree search with token budget constraints, ensuring more efficient and accurate decoding in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Tree-search decoding is an effective form of test-time scaling for large language models (LLMs), but real-world deployment imposes a fixed per-query token budget that varies across settings. Existing tree-search policies are largely budget-agnostic, treating the budget as a termination condition, which can lead to late-stage over-branching or premature termination. We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes.

*Shweta Parihar,Liu Guangliang,Natalie Parde,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context-CDA, a method to mitigate bias in language models using context-augmented data augmentation while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of counterfactual data augmentation approaches in mitigating bias without harming language modeling capability.

Method: Integrate large LMs for generating diverse and contextually relevant data, and use uncertainty-based filtering to improve data quality for fine-tuning smaller LMs.

Result: Context-CDA reduces bias effectively, maintains language modeling performance, and provides insights into social biases through analysis.

Conclusion: Context-CDA is a simple and effective approach for debiasing while preserving language model capabilities and improving understanding of biases.

Abstract: A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.

### [62] [On the Optimal Reasoning Length for RL-Trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09591)
*Daisuke Nohara,Taishi Nakamura,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning improves reasoning in language models but increases output length and computational costs. Finding an optimal balance in output length remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between reasoning performance and computational cost due to increased chain of thought outputs in reinforcement learning models.

Method: The authors investigate length control methods on two specific models, testing hypotheses about output length and evaluating its impact on reasoning and efficiency.

Result: Length penalties hinder reasoning acquisition, while tuning length control improves efficiency, especially for models already adept at reasoning. Two failure modes were identified: dispersion in long outputs and under-thinking in short outputs.

Conclusion: Optimal length control is critical for balancing reasoning performance and efficiency in reinforcement learning enhanced language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.

### [63] [Learning from the Irrecoverable: Error-Localized Policy Optimization for Tool-Integrated LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09598)
*Qiao Liang,Yuke Zhu,Chao Ge,Lei Yang,Ying Shen,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELPO, a method optimizing policies by localizing and addressing irrecoverable errors in long-horizon tasks, improving agent performance in tool-integrated reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcome-only reinforcement learning struggles with delayed rewards and weak step-level credit assignment in tool-integrated reasoning tasks. Localizing critical early errors is crucial for effective learning in long-horizon trajectories.

Method: The authors propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), utilizing binary-search rollout trees for error localization, hierarchical advantage attribution for stable signals, and adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on critical errors and their suffix.

Result: ELPO consistently outperforms Agentic RL baselines across benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, demonstrating gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency.

Conclusion: ELPO effectively addresses key problems in tool-integrated reasoning by localizing irrecoverable errors and providing fine-grained credit assignment, leading to improved performance in various complex benchmarks.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) enables LLM agents to solve tasks through planning, tool use, and iterative revision, but outcome-only reinforcement learning in this setting suffers from sparse, delayed rewards and weak step-level credit assignment. In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency. Our code will be publicly released soon.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlignTune, a toolkit to standardize and enhance reproducibility in post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of reproducibility in experiments due to backend-specific tools, reward fragmentation, and pipeline inconsistencies in LLM alignment motivated the development of this toolkit.

Method: AlignTune provides a unified interface supporting supervised fine-tuning and RLHF-style optimization using interchangeable backend systems. It includes a standardized reward layer and evaluation modules.

Result: AlignTune simplifies controlled experiments, enhances reproducibility, and addresses backend-specific challenges, making alignment research more systematic.

Conclusion: AlignTune overcomes key issues in LLM alignment workflows by streamlining processes and enabling reproducible research.

Abstract: Post-training alignment is central to deploying large language models (LLMs), yet practical workflows remain split across backend-specific tools and ad-hoc glue code, making experiments hard to reproduce. We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks. By isolating backend-specific logic behind a single factory boundary, AlignTune enables controlled comparisons and reproducible alignment experiments.

Result: MATA exhibits superior accuracy and efficient reasoning compared to existing methods, as demonstrated across two varying benchmarks with ten language models.

Conclusion: The work highlights that orchestrating multiple reasoning pathways using lightweight tools and small models ensures efficient, scalable, and reliable TableQA while reducing dependency on large LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved table understanding tasks such as Table Question Answering (TableQA), yet challenges remain in ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency, especially in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments. In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA. The code is available at https://github.com/AIDAS-Lab/MATA.

### [67] [Life Cycle-Aware Evaluation of Knowledge Distillation for Machine Translation: Environmental Impact and Translation Quality Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09691)
*Joseph Attieh,Timothee Mickus,Anne-Laure Ligozat,Aurélie Névéol,Jörg Tiedemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines knowledge distillation (KD) methods in machine translation by assessing both translation quality and computational cost, expressed as a carbon footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consideration for computational complexity in KD studies for machine translation, making it hard to choose efficient KD methods under resource constraints.

Method: The researchers evaluate KD methods by combining translation quality metrics with computational carbon footprint analysis using the MLCA tool.

Result: The study reveals that distillation has a high carbon footprint at small deployment scales, while inference dominates the footprint at larger scales. Word-level KD provides better trade-offs between quality and carbon footprint compared to sequence-level KD.

Conclusion: The study provides reproducible guidance to choose KD methods while balancing translation quality and computational cost.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a tool to compress a larger system (teacher) into a smaller one (student). In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.

*Abdulhai Alali,Abderrahmane Issam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses Limited Language Model (LLM) performance for Arabic dialects using a combination of fine-tuning, adapter merging, and decoding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM's handling of dialect variations, which are underrepresented due to limited data.

Method: Utilizes Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), adapter merging, and dialect-aware Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding.

Result: Enhanced dialectal fidelity and semantic accuracy achieved for Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic.

Conclusion: Proposed framework demonstrates effective Arabic dialect generation while maintaining compactness and robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages, especially high resource ones. Unfortunately, Dialect variations are still underrepresented due to limited data and linguistic variation. In this work, we adapt a pre-trained LLM to improve dialectal performance. Specifically, we use Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on monolingual and English Dialect parallel data, adapter merging and dialect-aware MBR decoding to improve dialectal fidelity generation and translation. Experiments on Syrian, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabic show that merging and MBR improve dialectal fidelity while preserving semantic accuracy. This combination provides a compact and effective framework for robust dialectal Arabic generation.

*Yiming Shu,Pei Liu,Tiange Zhang,Ruiyang Gao,Jun Ma,Chen Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceMem introduces a novel framework for maintaining long-term conversational memory by constructing narrative coherence through structured memory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM memory systems struggle with sustaining long-term interactions and narrative coherence in dialogue histories due to limited context windows.

Method: The paper proposes TraceMem, a three-stage pipeline: Short-term Memory Processing for topic segmentation and semantic extraction, Synaptic Memory Consolidation for episodic summarization and trace distillation, and Systems Memory Consolidation for hierarchical clustering and structured narrative threads.

Result: TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LoCoMo benchmark, excelling in multi-hop and temporal reasoning tasks, demonstrating enhanced capabilities for deep narrative comprehension.

Conclusion: TraceMem effectively addresses LLM limitations in long-term interactive memory, highlighting its significance in enhancing narrative coherence and reasoning, and providing meaningful perspectives on memory systems.

Abstract: Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

*Longhuan Xu,Cunjian Chen,Feng Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for unsupervised, sample-specific test-time adaptation (TTA) in large language models (LLMs) to enhance performance for single prompts without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and quality degradation in naive, unsupervised TTA for LLMs caused by overfitting and distribution drift in single-prompt adaptation.

Method: Layer-wise dynamic TTA, which uses a lightweight hypernetwork to regulate learning-rate multipliers per prompt representation, adaptation step, and transformer layer, ensuring stability and better control during parameter updates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves TTA stability and performance consistently across datasets and various LLMs.

Conclusion: Layer-wise dynamic TTA is effective in addressing the challenges of unsupervised, sample-specific test-time adaptation, improving both stability and generation quality.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates an AI environment integrated into a workflow to aid scientific assessment in climate science, showing accelerated synthesis but still needing substantial expert input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitation of AI 'guess and check' loops by developing tools for areas requiring consensus synthesis of theory and evidence, focusing on complex scientific tasks.

Method: An AI system was tested with 13 climate scientists evaluating AMOC stability. The AI assisted in creating a synthesis of 79 papers, undergoing 104 revision cycles within 46 person-hours.

Result: The AI accelerated workflow, contributing significantly to content generation and quality; however, less than half of the report was AI-produced, and experts were key for elevating it to scientific rigor.

Conclusion: AI can collaborate effectively in scientific synthesis, improving efficiency and logical consistency, but expert oversight remains essential to achieve scientifically acceptable outputs.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of AI co-scientists focuses on tasks characterized by repeatable verification, where agents explore search spaces in 'guess and check' loops. This paradigm does not extend to problems where repeated evaluation is impossible and ground truth is established by the consensus synthesis of theory and existing evidence. We evaluate a Gemini-based AI environment designed to support collaborative scientific assessment, integrated into a standard scientific workflow. In collaboration with a diverse group of 13 scientists working in the field of climate science, we tested the system on a complex topic: the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results show that AI can accelerate the scientific workflow. The group produced a comprehensive synthesis of 79 papers through 104 revision cycles in just over 46 person-hours. AI contribution was significant: most AI-generated content was retained in the report. AI also helped maintain logical consistency and presentation quality. However, expert additions were crucial to ensure its acceptability: less than half of the report was produced by AI. Furthermore, substantial oversight was required to expand and elevate the content to rigorous scientific standards.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, focusing on depth in English, French, Italian, Polish, and Spanish, with detailed metadata for flexible analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing corpora focused on linguistic breadth often lack depth in capturing the rich history of biblical translations. This gap limits studies on translation history and related analyses.

Method: The authors compiled a corpus from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, including 657 translations with detailed manual annotations to standardize identifiers for uniqueness at different levels (work, edition, revision year).

Result: The corpus consists of 352 unique translations, with unparalleled depth in English and notable coverage in French, Italian, Polish, and Spanish, alongside metadata to support diverse research approaches.

Conclusion: The developed corpus enables innovative micro and macro-level analyses in translation studies, setting a benchmark for quantitative exploration of translation history.

Abstract: Many European languages possess rich biblical translation histories, yet existing corpora - in prioritizing linguistic breadth - often fail to capture this depth. To address this gap, we introduce a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, of which 352 are unique, with unprecedented depth in five languages: English (208 unique versions from 396 total), French (41 from 78), Italian (18 from 33), Polish (30 from 48), and Spanish (55 from 102). Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define "uniqueness" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts. By providing the first resource designed for such flexible, multilevel analysis, our corpus establishes a new benchmark for the quantitative study of translation history.

TL;DR: This study proposes a method to enhance the interpretability of Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) by mapping contextualized word embeddings to a neurobiological feature space, enabling systematic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in interpreting how word meanings change over time and foster novel insights in Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) research.

Method: A mapping of pre-trained language model-derived contextual embeddings to a neurobiological feature space, where each dimension corresponds to primitive features of words, enhancing interpretability.

Result: The proposed method not only outperforms earlier methods in estimating LSC degrees but also allows for deeper analysis, uncovering overlooked LSC types and identifying specific word changes.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves interpretability in LSC analysis while providing better performance and novel discoveries in the field of semantic changes.

Abstract: Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) is the phenomenon in which the meaning of a word change over time. Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark for evaluating ASR systems in Bambara, revealing current performance gaps and providing a public leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of resources and benchmarks for Automatic Speech Recognition in the Bambara language.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark based on one hour of professionally recorded Bambara constitutional text and evaluated 37 ASR models under controlled conditions.

Result: Findings showed significant underperformance, with the best model achieving a 46.76% Word Error Rate and multilingual models often exceeding 100% WER.

Conclusion: Current methods like multilingual pre-training are insufficient for underrepresented languages like Bambara, necessitating further research and dataset development.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first standardized benchmark for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in the Bambara language, utilizing one hour of professionally recorded Malian constitutional text. Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\% WER. These results suggest that multilingual pre-training and model scaling alone are insufficient for underrepresented languages. Furthermore, because this dataset represents a best-case scenario of the most simplified and formal form of spoken Bambara, these figures are yet to be tested against practical, real-world settings. We provide the benchmark and an accompanying public leaderboard to facilitate transparent evaluation and future research in Bambara speech technology.

*Daniel Kaiser,Arnoldo Frigessi,Ali Ramezani-Kebrya,Benjamin Ricaud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the token efficiency of large language models (LLMs) during reasoning tasks, analyzing where tokens are used or wasted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of standard evaluations that only measure accuracy, ignoring token usage efficiency in LLM reasoning tasks.

Method: The framework decomposes token efficiency into factors like completion under a token budget, conditional correctness, and verbosity. It also introduces metrics for reasoning trace quality to better understand token usage.

Result: Evaluations on 25 models using the CogniLoad dataset reveal discrepancies between accuracy and token-efficiency rankings, driven by conditional correctness and differences in verbalization overhead.

Conclusion: The decomposition framework helps diagnose specific token inefficiency bottlenecks, suggesting targeted interventions to improve reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models trained for reasoning trade off inference tokens against accuracy, yet standard evaluations report only final accuracy, obscuring where tokens are spent or wasted. We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in the underrepresented task of scientometric question answering, dealing with meta-scientific queries about the 'science of science,' which requires advanced planning and data retrieval methods.

Method: The system uses an LLM-powered workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts to decompose tasks, retrieve data, and synthesize it into well-structured analyses.

Result: An end-to-end system is implemented and evaluated using subject matter experts and LLMs-as-judges, providing insights into the effectiveness of LLMs for this niche task.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the potential of LLMs in addressing complex scientometric questions and provides open-sourced materials for further development in this task.

Abstract: This paper introduces AnalyticsGPT, an intuitive and efficient large language model (LLM)-powered workflow for scientometric question answering. This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the "science of science." When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GloSA-sum, a summarization method leveraging topological data analysis (TDA) for global structure awareness, improving coherence and efficiency in text summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing summarization methods, which often overlook global structure and lead to disrupted coherence and performance, as well as to offer a more resource-efficient alternative to large language models (LLMs).

Method: The method, GloSA-sum, employs persistent homology in TDA to identify core semantics and constructs a semantic-weighted graph for summarization. A topology-guided iterative strategy is employed for efficient computation, and a hierarchical strategy for segment-level and global summarization enhances long-text processing.

Result: GloSA-sum achieves reduced redundancy, improved semantic and logical coherence, and demonstrates both accuracy and efficiency in summarization tasks across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GloSA-sum successfully balances efficiency and accuracy in summarization, preserves essential reasoning chains, and benefits LLM downstream tasks by effectively shortening contexts.

Abstract: Text summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), and the information explosion has made long-document processing increasingly demanding, making summarization essential. Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.

*Abdulmuizz Khalak,Abderrahmane Issam,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores cross-lingual transfer in Arabic language models and highlights varying transfer effectiveness due to differences in Arabic dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of Arabic Language Models (LMs) in adapting to Arabic dialects due to their variations from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

Method: They use probing on three NLP tasks and analyze representational similarity to evaluate cross-lingual transfer across Arabic dialects.

Result: The study found that cross-lingual transfer is uneven across dialects, influenced by geographical proximity, and observed negative interference when models support all dialects.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models is achievable but affected by dialectal diversity, raising concerns about the efficacy of training multi-dialectal Arabic models.

Abstract: Arabic Language Models (LMs) are pretrained predominately on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and are expected to transfer to its dialects. While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.

*Bakhtawar Ahtisham,Kirk Vanacore,Zhuqian Zhou,Jinsook Lee,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to predict the correctness of their own predictions in labeling teacher dialogue, achieving effective error detection through linguistic pattern analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipelines for labeling and analyzing educational dialogue using LLMs lack reliable mechanisms to identify and address model errors, raising the need for scalable quality control methods.

Method: The authors utilized a dataset of 30,300 labeled teacher utterances, tested reasoning-based error detection using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and applied five supervised classifiers (best performance by a Random Forest classifier achieving an F1 score of 0.83). They also explored linguistic correctness markers through the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework.

Result: The study achieved effective error detection with an F1 score of 0.83 using a Random Forest classifier. Specialist detectors enhanced performance for complex instructional constructs, and linguistic markers like causation and tentativeness were identified as indicators of model correctness.

Conclusion: Reasoning-based error detection is a scalable, practical method to enhance automated labeling quality in educational dialogue analysis, with linguistic markers aiding in the identification of incorrect model reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.

*Yayun Zhang,Guanyi Chen,Fahime Same,Saad Mahamood,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how speakers of Mandarin Chinese decide to quantify in naturalistic contexts, focusing on their strategies and precision during speech and writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individuals choose to use quantification in everyday communication, particularly in unconstrained, naturalistic production scenarios.

Method: Speakers freely described scenes with multiple objects using a picture-based elicitation task, and their quantificational choices were analyzed across spoken and written modalities.

Result: Findings reveal that numerosity, animacy, and production modality influence whether and how speakers quantify, with higher numerosity reducing precision and likelihood of quantification.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into naturalistic quantification behaviors and offers a dataset for further exploration of quantity expressions in language production.

Abstract: Quantification is a fundamental component of everyday language use, yet little is known about how speakers decide whether and how to quantify in naturalistic production. We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.

*Johan Sofalas,Dilushri Pavithra,Nevidu Jayatilleke,Ruvan Weerasinghe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Sinhala Figures of Speech (FoS) dataset and examines cultural origins and cross-lingual translations while evaluating existing models and proposing tools for improved NLP in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of translating figures of speech in low-resource languages like Sinhala, which are deeply embedded in culture and poorly managed by current Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems.

Method: The authors developed a dataset of 2,344 Sinhala figures of speech with cultural and cross-lingual annotations, introduced a binary classifier to differentiate FoS types with 92% accuracy, and evaluated the performance of large language models (LLMs) on the dataset.

Result: The binary classifier achieved 92% accuracy, and the assessment of current LLMs on the dataset exposed their significant limitations in translating idiomatic meanings accurately.

Conclusion: The study highlights the deficiencies in existing LLMs for understanding culturally rooted idioms and offers the dataset as a foundation for advancing research in low-resource NLP and culturally aware machine translation.

Abstract: Figures of Speech (FoS) consist of multi-word phrases that are deeply intertwined with culture. While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) performs relatively well with the figurative expressions of high-resource languages, it often faces challenges when dealing with low-resource languages like Sinhala due to limited available data. To address this limitation, we introduce a corpus of 2,344 Sinhala figures of speech with cultural and cross-lingual annotations. We examine this dataset to classify the cultural origins of the figures of speech and to identify their cross-lingual equivalents. Additionally, we have developed a binary classifier to differentiate between two types of FOS in the dataset, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 92%. We also evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this dataset. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in the current capabilities of LLMs, as these models often struggle to accurately convey idiomatic meanings. By making this dataset publicly available, we offer a crucial benchmark for future research in low-resource NLP and culturally aware machine translation.

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Zimo Wang,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Steer2Edit transforms steering vectors for LLM behavior control into selective parameter updates for improved results without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering methods for LLMs focus on uniform inference-time control, often causing trade-offs in behavior and utility. This approach ignores individual component roles in LLM behavior.

Method: Proposes a framework called Steer2Edit that applies selective rank-1 weight edits to specific attention heads and MLP neurons, enabling tailored and interpretable control without compromising inference efficiency.

Result: The method improved safety alignment by 17.2%, increased truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduced reasoning length by 12.2% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Steer2Edit bridges the gap between steering controls and weight edits, providing a practical, training-free approach to improve LLM behavior in specific tasks.

Abstract: Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the challenges of achieving continuous self-evolution and safety alignment in multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs), demonstrating that such systems inherently face safety risks due to statistical blind spots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution in agent systems while ensuring safety alignment, particularly focusing on the feasibility of achieving a balance between these goals.

Method: Using an information-theoretic framework, the authors formalize safety metrics and analyze theoretical and empirical data from open-ended and closed self-evolving systems to investigate safety erosion during isolated self-evolution.

Result: The study shows both theoretically and through experiments that isolated self-evolution leads to degradation in safety alignment, creating risks to built-in safety systems within AI societies.

Conclusion: Achieving continuous, safe self-evolution in isolated AI systems is impossible without external oversight or new safety-preserving mechanisms, emphasizing the need for a shift in focus toward intrinsic dynamical risks and robust solutions.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.

*Tilahun Yeshambel,Moncef Garouani,Josiane Mothe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Amharic datasets for research on neural retrieval and generative modeling, addressing a gap in resources for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide resources for neural models in low-resource languages like Amharic, emphasizing the scarcity of high-quality supervised data.

Method: Two datasets were created: 1) A retrieval-ranking dataset with manually verified query-document triplets and 2) An instruction prompt-response dataset with prompts generated by LLMs and refined manually. Both datasets adhere to standardized formats.

Result: The datasets consist of 1,091 query-positive-negative triplets and 6,285 refined prompt-response pairs, validated and prepared for reproducible research.

Conclusion: The release of these datasets fills a critical resource gap and provides a replicable methodology for supporting NLP research in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Neural retrieval and GPT-style generative models rely on large, high-quality supervised data, which is still scarce for low-resource languages such as Amharic. We release an Amharic data resource consisting of two datasets that supports research on (i) neural retrieval-ranking and (ii) instruction-following text generation. The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e.g., DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers. The instruction prompt-response dataset comprises 6,285 Amharic prompt-response pairs spanning multiple domains and instruction types, generated with several LLMs and refined through manual review and correction for grammaticality, relevance, fluency, and factual plausibility. We release both datasets with standardized splits and formats (CSV,JSON,JSONL) to enable reproducible work on Amharic retrieval, ranking, and generative modelling. These datasets also come with a methodology that can be generalized to other low-resource languages.

*William Lugoloobi,Thomas Foster,William Bankes,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods for efficiently handling queries with large language models (LLMs) by determining when extended reasoning is necessary, using probes on pre-generation activations to predict success likelihood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Running LLMs for extended reasoning on all inputs is computationally expensive. The goal is to identify when extra effort in computation is truly required for a query.

Method: Linear probes were applied to pre-generation activations of LLMs to predict policy-specific success rates for tasks. Surface-level features such as question length and TF-IDF were compared against these internal representations.

Result: Internal model representations outperformed surface-level features in predicting model-specific difficulty. Routing queries across multiple models using these probes reduced inference costs up to 70% while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: Internal representations in LLMs, even if diverging from human difficulty perceptions, enable significant efficiency improvements in inference without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Running LLMs with extended reasoning on every problem is expensive, but determining which inputs actually require additional compute remains challenging. We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

TL;DR: ATTNPO is a low-overhead RL framework leveraging attention signals to improve reasoning efficiency by reducing redundancy and preserving accuracy, achieving better results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of overthinking in large reasoning models trained with RLVR, which often generates redundant reasoning without improving performance.

Method: Introduced ATTNPO, a reinforcement learning framework using intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment to suppress redundant reasoning steps and preserve important ones.

Result: ATTNPO significantly reduces reasoning length and improves performance across 9 benchmarks.

Conclusion: ATTNPO offers a lightweight and effective solution to mitigate overthinking in reasoning models, achieving enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often overthink, generating redundant reasoning without performance gains. Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCRC models lack the ability to provide reasoning or explanations for their answers, which limits interpretability and understanding of their decision-making.

Method: The authors created a novel Vietnamese dataset for MCRC and introduced ViMultiChoice, a model designed for joint prediction of answers and explanations.

Result: ViMultiChoice outperformed current MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on both ViMMRC 2.0 and the newly introduced dataset, with improved multiple-choice accuracy from joint training.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of answer selection and explanation generation enhances performance and interpretability in Vietnamese reading comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Multiple-choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC) models aim to select the correct answer from a set of candidate options for a given question. However, they typically lack the ability to explain the reasoning behind their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Vietnamese dataset designed to train and evaluate MCRC models with explanation generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset. Additionally, we show that jointly training option decision and explanation generation leads to significant improvements in multiple-choice accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how children acquire syntax using neural language models, challenging the need for innate linguistic constraints by showing evidence of generalization in models trained on limited text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH) and test if neural language models, lacking innate linguistic constraints, can acquire syntax like human children.

Method: The authors introduced \poshbench, a training-evaluation suite, and trained Transformer models on a developmentally plausible corpus with additional cognitive inductive biases.

Result: Transformer models demonstrated generalizations on syntax phenomena but were less efficient and weaker than children. Adding cognitive biases improved general syntax competence but not specific test performance.

Conclusion: The study challenges the idea that innate syntax is mandatory for generalization but highlights a need for further inductive biases to achieve human-like data efficiency.

Abstract: How can children acquire native-level syntax from limited input? According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViSpeechFormer, a phoneme-based model for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), achieving strong performance and generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vietnamese has a transparent phonetic orthography, which allows for direct grapheme-to-phoneme mapping, motivating the development of a phoneme-based ASR model for improved performance.

Method: The paper proposes ViSpeechFormer, a phoneme-based ASR framework for Vietnamese, explicitly utilizing phonemic representations for processing speech data.

Result: ViSpeechFormer outperforms existing methods in two Vietnamese ASR datasets, demonstrates better generalization for out-of-vocabulary words, and reduces bias in training.

Conclusion: ViSpeechFormer is a promising approach for Vietnamese ASR and potentially for other languages with phonetic orthographies, showing robustness and high performance.

Abstract: Vietnamese has a phonetic orthography, where each grapheme corresponds to at most one phoneme and vice versa. Exploiting this high grapheme-phoneme transparency, we propose ViSpeechFormer (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Speech} Trans\textbf{Former}), a phoneme-based approach for Vietnamese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vietnamese ASR framework that explicitly models phonemic representations. Experiments on two publicly available Vietnamese ASR datasets show that ViSpeechFormer achieves strong performance, generalizes better to out-of-vocabulary words, and is less affected by training bias. This phoneme-based paradigm is also promising for other languages with phonetic orthographies. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multidimensional evaluation framework for analyzing LLM outputs in domain-specific, high-stakes contexts, emphasizing metrics like specificity, robustness, answer relevance, and context utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods inadequately assess the ability of language models to provide fine-grained, domain-critical details for decision-making in high-stakes settings.

Method: The authors propose a reference-free, multidimensional evaluation framework and a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs. They also conduct human evaluations to analyze model performance and subjectivity.

Result: The results demonstrate that no single metric captures the quality of responses adequately, highlighting the need for a structured evaluation framework.

Conclusion: Structured, multi-metric evaluations are necessary to ensure the reliability of LLMs in complex, high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support question answering and decision-making in high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as natural hazard response and infrastructure planning, where effective answers must convey fine-grained, decision-critical details. However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation. Our results show that no single metric sufficiently captures answer quality in isolation and demonstrate the need for structured, multi-metric evaluation frameworks when deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications.

*Wenxuan Xie,Yujia Wang,Xin Tan,Chaochao Lu,Xia Hu,Xuhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRIFT, a dual-model architecture to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by separating knowledge extraction from reasoning, effectively improving performance on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating extensive and dynamic knowledge into LLMs is challenging due to issues like entangled factual data and reasoning, context window limits, retriever noise, and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: DRIFT uses a dual-model approach with a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into query-specific, implicit fact tokens. These tokens are then mapped into the reasoning model's embedding space for efficient processing.

Result: Experiments show that DRIFT significantly boosts performance on long-context tasks, surpassing other models of similar sizes.

Conclusion: DRIFT offers a scalable, efficient method to improve LLMs' reasoning and context window capabilities, presenting a strong advancement in handling long-context data.

Abstract: The integration of extensive, dynamic knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to the inherent entanglement of factual data and reasoning patterns. Existing solutions, ranging from non-parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to parametric knowledge editing, are often constrained in practice by finite context windows, retriever noise, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model for joint multi-modal claim verification, evidence retrieval, and explanation generation using textual and visual inputs, complemented by a new scientific AI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current claim verification methods often overlook reasoning over visual evidence and lack explainability, resulting in inaccurate results.

Method: The authors propose a model using a two-layer multi-modal graph for evidence retrieval, multi-modal fusion for verification, and Fusion-in-Decoder for generating explanations.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates improved performance in experiments and also introduces AIChartClaim, a specialized dataset in the AI domain.

Conclusion: Joint multi-modal reasoning with explainability significantly enhances claim verification tasks.

Abstract: Verifying the truthfulness of claims usually requires joint multi-modal reasoning over both textual and visual evidence, such as analyzing both textual caption and chart image for claim verification. In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnaBench, a benchmark for scientific table and figure analysis, and proposes a multi-agent framework, Anagent, which achieves notable improvements in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in AI systems' ability to analyze complex, multimodal scientific knowledge, particularly scientific tables and figures, due to their heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements.

Method: The authors developed AnaBench, a benchmark featuring 63,178 instances categorized along seven complexity dimensions, and proposed Anagent, a multi-agent system with four specialized agents (Planner, Expert, Solver, Critic) using modular training strategies including supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The Anagent system achieved significant performance improvements, up to 13.43% in training-free settings and 42.12% with finetuning, in scientific table and figure analysis across 170 subdomains.

Conclusion: Anagent demonstrates that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific analysis, and it significantly advances the capabilities of AI in analyzing scientific tables and figures.

Abstract: In scientific research, analysis requires accurately interpreting complex multimodal knowledge, integrating evidence from different sources, and drawing inferences grounded in domain-specific knowledge. However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems struggle to consistently demonstrate such capabilities. The complexity and variability of scientific tables and figures, combined with heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements, pose fundamental obstacles to scientific table \& figure analysis. To quantify these challenges, we introduce AnaBench, a large-scale benchmark featuring $63,178$ instances from nine scientific domains, systematically categorized along seven complexity dimensions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Anagent, a multi-agent framework for enhanced scientific table \& figure analysis through four specialized agents: Planner decomposes tasks into actionable subtasks, Expert retrieves task-specific information through targeted tool execution, Solver synthesizes information to generate coherent analysis, and Critic performs iterative refinement through five-dimensional quality assessment. We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\uparrow 13.43\%$ in training-free settings and $\uparrow 42.12\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \& figure analysis.

*Mohamed Afane,Kayla Laufer,Wenqi Wei,Ying Mao,Junaid Farooq,Ying Wang,Juntao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Quantum-Audit, a benchmark for assessing LLM understanding in quantum computing concepts with 2,700 questions. Evaluation of 26 models revealed varied performance, with some models surpassing expert scores but struggling with advanced topics and identifying false premises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap in systematically measuring language models' understanding of quantum computing concepts, as existing benchmarks focus primarily on tasks like code generation and circuit design.

Method: The benchmark includes 2,700 questions covering various quantum computing topics, split into expert-written, LLM-generated, and questions with open-ended or erroneous premises. The authors evaluated 26 models on these questions and compared results against human participants.

Result: Top models like Claude Opus 4.5 exceeded the human expert average with 84% accuracy. However, accuracy dropped on expert-written questions (by 12 points) and further on advanced topics (e.g., 73% on security). Models also struggled with identifying false premises, achieving less than 66% accuracy on critical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: While top-performing language models can rival or exceed expert performance on many quantum computing tasks, significant weaknesses remain in reasoning on complex topics and recognizing erroneous premises.

Abstract: Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.

*Radib Bin Kabir,Tawsif Tashwar Dipto,Mehedi Ahamed,Sabbir Ahmed,Md Hasanul Kabir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks lightweight Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) converted from compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), showing SNNs' higher energy efficiency and comparable accuracy for edge intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore energy-efficient alternatives to CNNs for edge intelligence by focusing on lightweight SNN pipelines, which are often overlooked in prior research.

Method: Compact CNN architectures like ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet were converted into SNNs with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons. These were trained using surrogate gradient descent and evaluated across several metrics including accuracy and energy consumption.

Result: SNNs showed up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than CNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy. SNN-SqueezeNet performed best among the lightweight SNNs, and its optimized pruned version achieved nearly CNN-level accuracy with a significant energy reduction.

Conclusion: Lightweight SNNs are practical low-power alternatives suitable for edge intelligence. Structured pruning further optimizes these models, establishing them as energy-efficient solutions for edge deployment.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.

*Ruijie Ye,Jiayi Zhang,Zhuoxin Liu,Zihao Zhu,Siyuan Yang,Li Li,Tianfu Fu,Franck Dernoncourt,Yue Zhao,Jiacheng Zhu,Ryan Rossi,Wenhao Chai,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agent Banana is introduced as a framework to address challenges in instruction-based professional image editing, achieving superior multi-turn consistency and background fidelity while handling ultra high-definition images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professional image editing workflows face challenges such as over-editing, multi-turn model issues, and insufficient resolutions for real-world applications, calling for more reliable, high-definition solutions.

Method: Agent Banana uses a hierarchical planner-executor framework, leveraging Context Folding for interaction history management and Image Layer Decomposition for precise, localized, high-resolution image edits.

Result: Agent Banana outperforms existing models on the HDD-Bench benchmark with high multi-turn consistency, object fidelity, and background preservation, while also performing well on standard edit benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study introduces Agent Banana as a robust tool for complex, professional image editing tasks, improving real-world applicability in workflows that require precision and high fidelity.

Abstract: We study instruction-based image editing under professional workflows and identify three persistent challenges: (i) editors often over-edit, modifying content beyond the user's intent; (ii) existing models are largely single-turn, while multi-turn edits can alter object faithfulness; and (iii) evaluation at around 1K resolution is misaligned with real workflows that often operate on ultra high-definition images (e.g., 4K). We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows.

*Saar Huberman,Kfir Goldberg,Or Patashnik,Sagie Benaim,Ron Mokady*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SimMotion benchmarks to reveal biases in current video models and proposes 'SemanticMoments,' a training-free approach that leverages temporal statistics on semantic features for better motion-centric video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inadequacies in video understanding, where current methods overly depend on static or appearance-based features and traditional motion-centric methods lack semantic understanding.

Method: The authors created SimMotion benchmarks combining synthetic and real-world data to evaluate motion-centric performance and propose SemanticMoments, a method that calculates temporal statistics on pre-trained semantic model features.

Result: SemanticMoments outperforms current RGB, flow, and text-based methods on the SimMotion benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that computing temporal statistics in semantic feature spaces provides a scalable and robust approach for motion-based video understanding.

Abstract: Retrieving videos based on semantic motion is a fundamental, yet unsolved, problem. Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.

### [99] [A Hybrid Deterministic Framework for Named Entity Extraction in Broadcast News Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09154)
*Andrea Filiberto Lucas,Dylan Seychell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for detecting and extracting personal names from news videos through a modular, interpretable, and deterministic pipeline, offering transparency and traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable, transparent methods to extract on-screen information from the increasing volume of video-based news content due to the impracticality of manual indexing.

Method: The paper presents a curated dataset of annotated frames and a modular extraction pipeline designed for graphical element localization within deterministic, auditable conditions.

Result: The pipeline achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, with balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%). It avoids hallucination and enables traceability, though generative models show slightly higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18%).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a transparent, reliable solution for extracting names in news media, providing operational robustness and methodological rigor for journalistic needs.

Abstract: The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.
  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.

*Ahmed Rahu,Brian Shula,Brandon Combs,Aqsa Sultana,Surendra P. Singh,Vijayan K. Asari,Derrick Forchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study aims to determine if convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can identify subtle histological features in low-grade tubular adenomas that predict future colorectal cancer risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal cancer remains a major health issue even in patients with initially low-risk adenomas, highlighting the need for better risk stratification methods to guide surveillance and preventative strategies.

Method: The investigation utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning methods to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs) of low-grade adenomas for features predictive of cancer risk.

Result: The study explores the capability of CNNs to identify subtle histological markers that correlate with long-term progression risk of colorectal cancer.

Conclusion: Machine learning employing CNNs has the potential to enhance risk stratification in patients with low-grade adenomas, thereby improving personalized prevention and monitoring strategies.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality, despite the widespread implementation of prophylactic initiatives aimed at detecting and removing precancerous polyps. Although screening effectively reduces incidence, a notable portion of patients initially diagnosed with low-grade adenomatous polyps will still develop CRC later in life, even without the presence of known high-risk syndromes. Identifying which low-risk patients are at higher risk of progression is a critical unmet need for tailored surveillance and preventative therapeutic strategies. Traditional histological assessment of adenomas, while fundamental, may not fully capture subtle architectural or cytological features indicative of malignant potential. Advancements in digital pathology and machine learning provide an opportunity to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and objectively. This study investigates whether machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can detect subtle histological features in WSIs of low-grade tubular adenomas that are predictive of a patient's long-term risk of developing colorectal cancer.

*Hirunima Jayasekara,Chuong Huynh,Yixuan Ren,Christabel Acquaye,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in accurately synthesizing images from complex textual prompts by introducing a scene graph-based approach that enhances semantic and structural understanding for better visual outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image synthesis models struggle to maintain semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs involving multiple objects and their relationships.

Method: The study proposes a scene graph-based zero-shot conditioning mechanism. It uses the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which employs a lightweight language model to generate soft visual guidance, optimizing diffusion-based image generation during inference.

Result: The proposed method shows improved alignment between textual prompts and generated images while supporting coherent and diverse synthesis.

Conclusion: Scene graph-based conditioning with ASQL enhances the compositional and semantic capabilities of text-to-image synthesis models, overcoming limitations of rigid pre-defined layouts.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visual representation of complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships is a critical challenge in text-to-image synthesis. Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization. This enables the model to maintain text-image alignment while supporting lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis.

*Michael D. Murray,James Tung,Richard W. Nuckols*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike during stair ascent using computer vision and a CNN-RNN model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the anticipatory control in assistive systems by predicting how the foot will interact with changing environments.

Method: Eight subjects equipped with RGB-D cameras and instrumented insoles performed stair ascent. A CNN-RNN model was trained to forecast COP and TOI within a 250ms window before foot-strike.

Result: The model achieved reasonable accuracy, with mean absolute errors decreasing as the prediction window approached foot-strike. Faster toe-swing speeds enhanced COP prediction accuracy while anterior foot-strikes reduced it. The lightweight model ran efficiently at 60 FPS.

Conclusion: The feasibility of forecasting foot COP and TOI with visual data using a lightweight model is demonstrated, offering practical implications for assistive system control.

Abstract: Computer-vision (CV) has been used for environmental classification during gait and is often used to inform control in assistive systems; however, the ability to predict how the foot will contact a changing environment is underexplored. We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.

*Chenyu Wang,Tianle Chen,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Kayhan Batmanghelich,Wenchao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, VLM-UQBench, for assessing uncertainty in vision-language models (VLMs) and identifies gaps in current uncertainty quantification practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To localize uncertainty in VLMs to its specific source—whether image, text, or cross-modal misalignment—to enhance safe and reliable behavior.

Method: The paper develops VLM-UQBench, a benchmark with curated subsets and a perturbation pipeline, and evaluates using metrics to measure sensitivity to uncertainties and hallucinations across various UQ methods.

Result: Findings show current UQ methods specialize by modality, interact weakly with hallucinations, and struggle with subtle instance-level ambiguities introduced by the benchmark's perturbations.

Conclusion: Existing uncertainty quantification methods need improvement to address the fine-grained and modality-aware uncertainties required for reliable deployment of VLMs.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for ensuring that vision-language models (VLMs) behave safely and reliably. A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces IR-SIS, a surgical image segmentation framework with adaptive refinement and clinician interaction through natural language feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing surgical image segmentation methods, such as fixed categories, lack of adaptive refinement, and absence of clinician interaction.

Method: Introduces IR-SIS, using fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, Vision-Language Models for assessment and refinement, and natural language clinician feedback. A new language-annotated dataset is constructed.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on in-domain and out-of-distribution data with improved results through clinician interaction is demonstrated.

Conclusion: IR-SIS bridges the gap in segmentation adaptability and clinician interaction, providing an advanced framework for surgical image segmentation.

Abstract: Surgical image segmentation is essential for robot-assisted surgery and intraoperative guidance. However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper investigates modulation-based text conditioning in diffusion transformers, showing that attention mechanisms are generally sufficient but that pooled embeddings enable performance gains as guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the necessity and performance impact of modulation-based text conditioning in diffusion transformers and explore alternative uses for text pooling.

Method: The authors analyze the role of pooled embeddings versus attention and propose using pooled embeddings as guidance for controllable outcome shifts.

Result: They reveal that, while pooled embeddings add little in conventional setups, they can enhance performance when used as guidance in tasks like text-to-image and image editing.

Conclusion: Pooled embeddings, when repurposed as guidance mechanisms, bring benefits without training requirements or significant runtime costs in various diffusion model tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of copyright protection for high-quality medical imaging datasets, which are susceptible to unauthorized use and require watermarking methods that work effectively for dynamic and high-resolution medical images.

Method: The authors propose a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method called X-Mark, utilizing a conditional U-Net to add unique perturbations to salient regions of X-ray images. The training objective includes multi-component objectives and Laplacian regularization for watermark efficacy, diagnosic preservation, and robustness.

Result: Experiments on the CheXpert dataset validate X-Mark, achieving a watermark success rate (WSR) of 100%, reducing false positives by 12% in certain scenarios, and demonstrating robustness against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: X-Mark is proven effective as an ownership protection mechanism for medical imaging datasets, ensuring both diagnostic quality and resilience under various conditions.

Abstract: High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.

*Subba Reddy Oota,Vijay Rowtula,Shahid Mohammed,Jeffrey Galitz,Minghsun Liu,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep multi-modal approach to predict a patient's risk of hospitalization due to wound deterioration, integrating wound variables and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high wound care costs and reduce hospitalization due to delayed treatment, patient non-compliance, or preexisting conditions.

Method: Developed a transfer learning-based multi-modal model using wound variables and images to assess healing trajectories and predict risks of hospitalization.

Result: The model effectively predicts wound variables using wound images and identifies healing trajectories to better assess hospitalization risks.

Conclusion: The novel model aids early detection of wound complexities and reduces clinicians' diagnostic effort, enhancing treatment outcomes and potentially lowering costs.

Abstract: Hospitalization of patients is one of the major factors for high wound care costs. Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAFRNet, a graph attention and fuzzy-rule model for classifying breast cancer histopathology images with limited labels, offering transparency and high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited annotations and the "blackbox" nature of deep learning models in breast cancer image classification, hindering clinical usability.

Method: The proposed GAFRNet integrates similarity-based graph attention and interpretable fuzzy-rule modules to model relationships and provide transparent predictions in histopathology image analysis.

Result: GAFRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, validating its reliability and superior performance for weakly supervised medical image tasks.

Conclusion: GAFRNet offers a robust and interpretable solution for histopathology image classification, enhancing generalization and practicality as a medical decision-support tool.

Abstract: Accurate classification of breast cancer histopathology images is pivotal for early oncological diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.However, conventional deep learning architectures often encounter performance degradation under limited annotations and suffer from a "blackbox" nature, hindering their clinical integration. To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision. GAFRNet constructs a similarity-driven graph representation to model intersample relationships and employs a multihead graph attention mechanism to capture complex relational features across heterogeneous tissue structures.Concurrently, a differentiable fuzzy-rule module encodes intrinsic topological descriptorsincluding node degree, clustering coefficient, and label consistencyinto explicit, human-understandable diagnostic logic. This design establishes transparent "IF-THEN" mappings that mimic the heuristic deduction process of medical experts, providing clear reasoning behind each prediction without relying on post-hoc attribution methods. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (BreakHis, Mini-DDSM, and ICIAR2018) demonstrate that GAFR-Net consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across multiple magnifications and classification tasks. These results validate the superior generalization and practical utility of GAFR-Net as a reliable decision-support tool for weakly supervised medical image analysis.

### [109] [Deep Modeling and Interpretation for Bladder Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09324)
*Ahmad Chaddad,Yihang Wu,Xianrui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates vision transformers (ViT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bladder cancer classification, finding that there is no one-size-fits-all model for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images, especially those involving bladder cancer, present challenges for deep learning models as abnormal regions tend to be small, necessitating effective evaluation of CNNs and ViTs.

Method: Thirteen models, including CNNs and ViTs, are assessed for classification performance, calibration analysis, and interpretability using GradCAM++, alongside approximately 300 simulated experiments on a multicenter dataset of bladder cancer.

Result: ConvNext models show limited generalization (~60% accuracy), while ViTs exhibit superior calibration. Test-time augmentation improves interpretability.

Conclusion: ConvNext performs better for in-distribution samples, while ViTs and their variants are more effective for out-of-distribution samples. No model is universally ideal.

Abstract: Deep models based on vision transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable performance on natural datasets. However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\sim 60\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples.

*Michail S. Alexiou,Nikolaos G. Bourbakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Kyrtos methodology for automatic recognition and analysis of curve charts in technical documents, converting graph data into natural language and SPN graphs for deeper document understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of holistically understanding technical documents by accurately analyzing various modalities, specifically focusing on charts with curves.

Method: The methodology adopts a clustering-based approach to recognize middle points of line segments constructing curves and analyzes these segments to capture behavioral characteristics, converting them into attributed graphs and natural language text.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates high accuracy of Kyrtos' methods by comparing the structural similarity between input chart curves and Kyrtos-generated approximations for multi-function charts.

Conclusion: Kyrtos successfully contributes to the automatic and accurate analysis of chart images, enriching technical document understanding with natural language descriptions and SPN graph conversions.

Abstract: Deep Understanding of Technical Documents (DUTD) has become a very attractive field with great potential due to large amounts of accumulated documents and the valuable knowledge contained in them. In addition, the holistic understanding of technical documents depends on the accurate analysis of its particular modalities, such as graphics, tables, diagrams, text, etc. and their associations. In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.

### [111] [Impact of domain adaptation in deep learning for medical image classifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09355)
*Yihang Wu,Ahmad Chaddad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores domain adaptation (DA) using ten deep learning models on medical image datasets, showing benefits such as improved performance, resilience to noise, and better calibration and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance model transferability across domains, specifically in medical imaging, by leveraging domain adaptation techniques to address challenges like noise, data heterogeneity, and limited labels.

Method: Ten deep learning models were simulated to perform various DA tasks across four medical imaging datasets, considering scenarios like multi-modality, noisy inputs, federated learning, and interpretability.

Result: Results show DA can improve performance, e.g., 4.7% accuracy improvement using ResNet34 in brain tumor datasets, enhanced robustness to noise, and a reduction in calibration error. Limited impact was observed in federated learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation demonstrates potential for improving model accuracy, calibration, and interpretability in medical imaging, though it shows limited benefits in specific situations like federated learning and noisy settings.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) is a quickly expanding area in machine learning that involves adjusting a model trained in one domain to perform well in another domain. While there have been notable progressions, the fundamental concept of numerous DA methodologies has persisted: aligning the data from various domains into a shared feature space. In this space, knowledge acquired from labeled source data can improve the model training on target data that lacks sufficient labels. In this study, we demonstrate the use of 10 deep learning models to simulate common DA techniques and explore their application in four medical image datasets. We have considered various situations such as multi-modality, noisy data, federated learning (FL), interpretability analysis, and classifier calibration. The experimental results indicate that using DA with ResNet34 in a brain tumor (BT) data set results in an enhancement of 4.7\% in model performance. Similarly, the use of DA can reduce the impact of Gaussian noise, as it provides $\sim 3\%$ accuracy increase using ResNet34 on a BT dataset. Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\sim 0.3\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification. In addition, the DA method can improve the interpretability of the models using the gradcam++ technique, which offers clinical values. Calibration analysis also demonstrates that using DA provides a lower expected calibration error (ECE) value $\sim 2\%$ compared to CNN alone on a multi-modality dataset.

*Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DBiSL, a novel framework addressing challenges in semi-supervised medical image analysis using fully differentiable bidirectional learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality labeled data for medical image segmentation and improve semi-supervised learning methods to better utilize unlabeled data.

Method: Proposed a Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework that integrates supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation with bidirectional interaction for dual-task tasks.

Result: DBiSL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark medical image segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: DBiSL advances the field of semi-supervised learning, provides insights into unified framework design, and sets a foundation for broader applications in computer vision tasks using a multitask learning approach.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance.

*Yan Luo,Advaith Ravishankar,Serena Liu,Yutong Yang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks single-slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction using five foundational models across medical and natural datasets, highlighting performance limits and depth ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the costly and time-consuming nature of volumetric imaging by leveraging image-to-3D foundation models to reconstruct 3D data from 2D modalities.

Method: The study benchmarks five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models across six medical and two natural datasets using voxel-based and point-cloud distance metrics.

Result: Reconstruction performance for medical datasets remains moderate overall due to depth reconstruction issues. SAM3D performs best for topological similarity, while other models oversimplify reconstructions.

Conclusion: Single-slice medical reconstruction has significant depth ambiguity, necessitating multi-view approaches for reliable 3D medical interpretation.

Abstract: A 3D understanding of anatomy is central to diagnosis and treatment planning, yet volumetric imaging remains costly with long wait times. Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.

*Zhikai Li,Jiatong Li,Xuewen Liu,Wangbo Zhao,Pan Du,Kaicheng Zhou,Qingyi Gu,Yang You,Zhen Dong,Kurt Keutzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces K-Sort Eval, a VLM-based evaluation framework for visual generative models that addresses scalability, reliability, and efficiency issues associated with traditional human-assessed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress in visual generative models necessitates faster, scalable, and reliable evaluation methods as traditional human-evaluated platforms are slow and expensive.

Method: K-Sort Eval leverages vision-language models with features like posterior correction and dynamic matching to align evaluations with human preferences using a dataset derived from human votes and (K+1)-wise comparisons.

Result: The proposed framework achieves evaluation results consistent with traditional methods while requiring fewer resources, successfully balancing efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: K-Sort Eval is a scalable and reliable alternative for evaluating generative models, addressing the limitations of current human-centric evaluation platforms.

Abstract: The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.

*Xinyu Wang,Ke Deng,Fei Dou,Jinbo Bi,Jin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LARV, a layer-wise adaptive rescaling method for model merging in vision transformers to address layer heterogeneity issues, improving existing methods without training data or retraining overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-vector merging methods treat all layers uniformly, ignoring layer-wise heterogeneity in vision transformers where shallow layers are sensitive to interference, and deeper layers store stable task-specific features.

Method: The proposed LARV assigns adaptive per-layer scales to task vectors before aggregation using a deterministic schedule. It computes data-free layer proxies and converts them into scales with lightweight rules, boosting merging methods without retraining.

Result: LARV improves task-vector merging performance consistently across multiple baselines and Vision Transformer settings. For instance, it enhances Iso-C: achieving 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14, while also suppressing interference and enhancing stability.

Conclusion: LARV is a novel, cost-efficient, layer-aware approach for model merging. It adapts merger methods to layer heterogeneity, turning model merging into a robust process, and outperforms uniform treatment of layers in vision transformers.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified framework analyzing stability and statistical properties of nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters, offering high-probability error bounds independent of reconstruction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores intrinsic limits in nonlinear inverse problems to improve understanding of stability and error bounds, especially in modern imaging and rendering.

Method: The approach combines blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise to establish bounds and concentration estimates, verified with Gaussian Splatting rendering.

Result: Derived deterministic stability inequalities, Lipschitz bounds, and nonasymptotic estimates showing tradeoff between resolution and model complexity in imaging.

Conclusion: This work provides operator-level insights and fundamental limits for high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems, aiding performance analysis in imaging and rendering fields.

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stability and statistical concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters. Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable framework adapting vision-language models for fine-grained truck classification from sparse LiDAR data, achieving effective classification without extensive manual labeling or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based methods for truck classification face scalability challenges due to dependence on supervised learning and labor-intensive annotation. Vision-language models promise few-shot generalization but struggle with sparse point cloud data.

Method: The framework transforms sparse LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D images using a depth-aware image generation pipeline. It uses off-the-shelf vision-language models without fine-tuning for classification, leveraging text-based guidance for regularization.

Result: The approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with minimal examples (16-30 per class) on real-world data and reduces manual labeling efforts. It achieves over 75% correct classification rate for specified drayage categories without costly training.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable, practical solution for fine-grained truck classification in intelligent transportation systems, enabling efficient cold-start strategies and minimizing manual effort.

Abstract: Fine-grained truck classification is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet current LiDAR-based methods face scalability challenges due to their reliance on supervised deep learning and labor-intensive manual annotation. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a "Semantic Anchor" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene synthesis methods lack deliberative reasoning, causing spatial hallucinations like object collisions.

Method: SceneReVis uses an iterative diagnose-and-act loop with multi-modal feedback and a novel dataset SceneChain-12k. Two-stage training involves Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity scenes, optimizing goals, and generalizing to diverse domains.

Conclusion: SceneReVis enhances spatial reasoning in 3D synthesis, reducing conflicts and improving scene generation quality and adaptability.

Abstract: Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel conformal prediction algorithm for instance segmentation models, ensuring calibrated and accurate outputs with provable guarantees. It is applied to various domains such as agriculture, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instance segmentation models lack proper uncertainty quantification and are not calibrated, leading to outputs where the predicted masks may not align closely with the ground truth.

Method: The proposed conformal prediction algorithm generates adaptive confidence sets for each pixel coordinate query, ensuring at least one mask achieves a high IoU with the true object. The algorithm has both asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.

Result: The method is effective across various tasks, such as agricultural field delineation and cell segmentation, outperforming existing baselines and adapting prediction set sizes based on query difficulty.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides a reliable and robust method for instance segmentation, offering provable guarantees and improved performance in challenging and diverse applications.

Abstract: Current instance segmentation models achieve high performance on average predictions, but lack principled uncertainty quantification: their outputs are not calibrated, and there is no guarantee that a predicted mask is close to the ground truth. To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask. We apply our algorithm to instance segmentation examples in agricultural field delineation, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection. Empirically, we find that our prediction sets vary in size based on query difficulty and attain the target coverage, outperforming existing baselines such as Learn Then Test, Conformal Risk Control, and morphological dilation-based methods. We provide versions of the algorithm with asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.

Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.

### [121] [A Scoping Review of Deep Learning for Urban Visual Pollution and Proposal of a Real-Time Monitoring Framework with a Visual Pollution Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09446)
*Mohammad Masudur Rahman,Md. Rashedur Rahman,Ashraful Islam,Saadia B Alam,M Ashraful Amin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews and synthesizes deep learning-based methods for addressing Urban Visual Pollution (UVP), suggesting a unified framework for monitoring and managing UVP using advanced models and indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban Visual Pollution (UVP) is a growing issue that lacks consolidated research on its automatic detection and practical applications.

Method: A systematic scoping review was conducted using PRISMA-ScR guidelines across seven academic databases, analyzing 26 relevant studies focused on UVP detection using deep learning techniques like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet.

Result: The review identifies limitations in current research, such as geography-specific datasets, absence of standardized taxonomies, and sparse real-time application systems. A novel framework combining a visual pollution index and real-time monitoring is proposed.

Conclusion: A unified UVP management system with a generalized deep learning model, standardized taxonomy, cross-city datasets, and an assessment index is essential for sustainable urban aesthetics and improved urban well-being.

Abstract: Urban Visual Pollution (UVP) has emerged as a critical concern, yet research on automatic detection and application remains fragmented. This scoping review maps the existing deep learning-based approaches for detecting, classifying, and designing a comprehensive application framework for visual pollution management. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, seven academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, SpringerNatureLink, and Wiley) were systematically searched and reviewed, and 26 articles were found. Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area. This review highlights the need for a unified UVP management system that incorporates pollutant taxonomy, a cross-city benchmark dataset, a generalized deep learning model, and an assessment index that supports sustainable urban aesthetics and enhances the well-being of urban dwellers.

### [122] [Look-Ahead and Look-Back Flows: Training-Free Image Generation with Trajectory Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09449)
*Yan Luo,Henry Huang,Todd Y. Zhou,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free methods, Look-Ahead and Look-Back, for improving diffusion model generation by directly smoothing trajectories in latent space. These approaches improve performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of error propagation from velocity field modifications in training-free diffusion models, providing more accurate generative trajectories without costly retraining.

Method: The authors propose Look-Ahead and Look-Back strategies for direct trajectory smoothing in latent space using curvature-gated averaging and exponential moving averages.

Result: Extensive experiments show these methods outperform state-of-the-art models significantly on datasets like COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.

Conclusion: Trajectory smoothing in latent space via Look-Ahead and Look-Back reduces errors and enhances generative performance without the need for retraining existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.

### [123] [ArtifactLens: Hundreds of Labels Are Enough for Artifact Detection with VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09475)
*James Burgess,Rameen Abdal,Dan Stoddart,Sergey Tulyakov,Serena Yeung-Levy,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtifactLens is a detection system for synthetic image artifacts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only a few hundred labeled images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect synthetic image artifacts efficiently and improve generator models without relying on large labeled datasets.

Method: Developed a system called ArtifactLens with a multi-component architecture, leveraging pre-trained VLMs and text-instruction optimization via in-context learning.

Result: ArtifactLens surpassed existing methods on five human artifact benchmarks, requiring significantly less labeled data.

Conclusion: Pretrained VLMs can be harnessed effectively with minimal labeled data to detect synthetic image artifacts and generalize across various types of artifacts and tasks.

Abstract: Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.

### [124] [FD-DB: Frequency-Decoupled Dual-Branch Network for Unpaired Synthetic-to-Real Domain Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09476)
*Chuanhai Zang,Jiabao Hu,XW Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FD-DB, a dual-branch frequency-decoupled model for synthetic-to-real image translation. It optimizes photorealism while preserving structural stability, improving segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce domain shift between synthetic and real data in geometry-sensitive vision tasks without compromising the structure or appearance realism.

Method: FD-DB uses a dual-branch model: a stable editing branch for physical parameter adjustments combined with a free residual branch for finer detail optimization. A gated fusion ensures frequency control during generation.

Result: On the YCB-V dataset, FD-DB enhances real-domain appearance consistency and boosts semantic segmentation performance significantly.

Conclusion: FD-DB effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real gap in image appearance while maintaining geometric fidelity, improving downstream tasks' reliability.

Abstract: Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.

### [125] [Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning for Histopathology Patch Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09477)
*Bodong Zhang,Xiwen Li,Hamid Manoochehri,Xiaoya Tang,Deepika Sirohi,Beatrice S. Knudsen,Tolga Tasdizen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called WeakSupCon for weakly supervised contrastive learning, improving feature representation learning in digital histopathology analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital histopathology faces challenges in analyzing gigapixel-scale WSIs due to limited manually annotated training labels, necessitating efficient methods like weakly supervised MIL.

Method: The paper proposes WeakSupCon, a feature representation learning framework utilizing bag-level labels for weakly supervised contrastive learning without instance-level pseudo-labeling.

Result: WeakSupCon outperforms self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets, enhancing downstream MIL performance.

Conclusion: WeakSupCon effectively optimizes feature representation learning for MIL tasks in histopathology, addressing label limitations and improving analysis efficiency.

Abstract: Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.
  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

TL;DR: The FedSurg challenge evaluated federated learning (FL) methods for surgical video classification on inflammation stages of appendicitis, assessing generalization and adaptation performance across clinical sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and benchmark federated learning methods' ability to generalize across clinical centers while preserving patient data privacy and enabling local model fine-tuning.

Method: Participants used preliminary Appendix300 video dataset to classify inflammation stages, testing two tasks: cross-center generalization and center-specific adaptation with fine-tuning. Submitted methods included foundation models, metric learning, and FL aggregation schemes.

Result: Limited generalization across centers was observed, but fine-tuning improved adaptation performance despite ranking instability. ViViT-based model performed best overall. Issues with class imbalance, hyperparameter tuning, and decentralized training were highlighted.

Conclusion: The challenge set the first benchmark for FL in surgical video classification, emphasizing trade-offs between personalization and robustness and the role of architecture, preprocessing, and loss design in advancements.

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

### [127] [Beyond Next-Token Alignment: Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models via Token Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09483)
*Lin Chen,Xiaoke Zhao,Kun Ding,Weiwei Feng,Changtao Miao,Zili Wang,Wenxuan Guo,Ying Wang,Kaiyuan Zheng,Bo Zhang,Zhe Li,Shiming Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Align-TI, a knowledge distillation framework targeted at enhancing token interactions in multimodal large language models to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to address deployment challenges tied to the large size of multimodal language models, exploring more dynamic distillation methods rather than relying solely on static next-token alignments.

Method: Align-TI integrates two core components: IVA for aligning visual-instruction token interactions and TPA for capturing dynamic token-to-token transition probabilities for generation tasks.

Result: Align-TI demonstrates a $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD and enables the distilled model to outperform a significantly larger model (LLaVA-1.5-7B) by $7.0\%$.

Conclusion: Align-TI establishes a new benchmark for efficient distillation of multimodal language models, enabling smaller models to rival or exceed the performance of larger counterparts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.

### [128] [OSI: One-step Inversion Excels in Extracting Diffusion Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09494)
*Yuwei Chen,Zhenliang He,Jia Tang,Meina Kan,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces One-step Inversion (OSI), a method to extract watermarks from diffusion-generated images, which is faster and more accurate than traditional multi-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods to extract watermarks from diffusion-generated images are computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the multi-step diffusion inversion process.

Method: The proposed OSI uses a learnable sign classification problem instead of precise regression, where the OSI model is initialized from a diffusion backbone and fine-tuned on synthesized noise-image pairs.

Result: OSI surpasses multi-step methods by being 20 times faster, providing higher extraction accuracy, and doubling watermark payload capacity, with consistent improvements across various settings.

Conclusion: OSI offers a significant advancement in watermark extraction by combining efficiency and accuracy, making it generalizable across different setups and cryptographic schemes.

Abstract: Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.

### [129] [Equilibrium contrastive learning for imbalanced image classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09506)
*Sumin Roh,Harim Kim,Ho Yun Lee,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL) to address limitations in supervised contrastive learning methods for imbalanced datasets, achieving improved performance on long-tailed and medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings in supervised contrastive learning for imbalanced datasets, such as poor alignment of class prototypes with classifiers and uneven influence of prototypes across classes.

Method: ECL promotes geometric equilibrium with two components: 1) achieving representation equilibrium through regular simplex geometry and balanced contributions of features and prototypes, and 2) aligning classifier weights with class prototypes.

Result: ECL demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised CL methods on imbalanced datasets, including CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, ISIC 2019, and the LCCT dataset.

Conclusion: ECL effectively enhances geometric equilibrium in representation learning, improving classification accuracy for imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.

*Kun Wang,Yun Zhu,Pan Zhou,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaDS, a framework for enhancing depth maps from degraded inputs using adaptive diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a robust depth super-resolution method capable of handling severely and arbitrarily degraded inputs.

Method: AdaDS uses Gaussian smoothing and adaptive reverse diffusion to refine degraded inputs, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for recovery.

Result: Experiments show AdaDS has strong zero-shot generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under diverse degradations.

Conclusion: AdaDS is a resilient and robust framework for depth super-resolution, excelling in diverse scenarios by leveraging adaptive strategies and generative priors.

Abstract: We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Mas Nurul Achmadiah,Afaroj Ahamad,Chi-Chia Sun,Wen-Kai Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI-based IoT application for fast-object detection, using a frame difference method implemented across several edge devices, demonstrating higher accuracy and efficiency compared to end-to-end methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for energy-efficient, accurate, and fast object detection in IoT systems, particularly for fast-moving objects, where traditional methods often fail.

Method: The method employed is the frame difference technique integrated with neural network models. It is optimized for three edge devices (AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator) and employs lightweight models like MobileNet for improved performance.

Result: The results showed MobileNet has high accuracy and energy efficiency, with significant gains: 28.314% (accuracy), 3.6x (efficiency), and 39.305% (latency reduction) over end-to-end methods. Fast-moving objects like trains and airplanes pose challenges, with slightly lower detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight detection method is highly effective for IoT applications, addressing fast-moving object detection efficiently and accurately, though object speed can impact accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper discusses the evolution of behavior analysis using computer vision, introduces a Universal Action Space (UAS), and applies it to studying human, mammalian, and chimpanzee behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional behavior analysis methods that relied on low-level features and lacked robustness, the motivation was to leverage deep learning and develop a comprehensive space for behavior categorization.

Method: The authors created a large-scale UAS based on existing labeled human-action datasets and applied this model to various animal and human behavior datasets.

Result: The development and application of UAS successfully analyzed mammalian and chimpanzee behavior, building on advancements in deep neural network-based visual recognition.

Conclusion: By providing a large-scale UAS, the paper demonstrates a modern approach to behavior analysis that improves robustness and generalization in behavior categorization. Source code is shared for transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets. The source code is released on GitHub at https://github.com/franktpmvu/Universal-Action-Space.

### [133] [Attention to details, logits to truth: visual-aware attention and logits enhancement to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09521)
*Jingyi Wang,Fei Li,Rujie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses insufficient visual attention in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by introducing a training-free method to boost task-relevant attention, reducing hallucinations and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with hallucinations due to inadequate visual attention strategies, highlighting the need for targeted attention improvements while avoiding increased attention to irrelevant tokens.

Method: The proposed method introduces a training-free attentional intervention algorithm that amplifies task-relevant visual attention by extracting vision-text cross-attention submatrices to reallocate focus and injecting visual attention during beam search decoding.

Result: Experiments show that the method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while maintaining accuracy and coherence in generated outputs.

Conclusion: The training-free attention intervention approach successfully mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs, addressing a key limitation of visual attention and improving overall model performance.

Abstract: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Singpath-VL, a vision-language AI model specialized for cervical cytology, addressing a lack of annotated datasets by creating a synthetic dataset and fine-tuning a multi-modal language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI has advanced in computational pathology but has been underexplored in cervical cytology due to the lack of large, annotated datasets.

Method: The authors created a novel three-stage pipeline using general-purpose models as weak annotators, refining descriptions through consensus and expert knowledge, and fine-tuned an existing model (Qwen3-VL-4B) to create Singpath-VL.

Result: Singpath-VL outperformed in detailed morphological analysis and cell diagnostic classification.

Conclusion: The model shows promise as an AI assistant in cytopathology, and a portion of the dataset and benchmarks will be open-sourced to support further advancements.

Abstract: We present Singpath-VL, a vision-language large model, to fill the vacancy of AI assistant in cervical cytology. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.

### [135] [HLGFA: High-Low Resolution Guided Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09524)
*Han Zhou,Yuxuan Gao,Yinchao Du,Xuezhe Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HLGFA, an anomaly detection framework for industrial applications, which aligns high-low resolution features of normal samples to identify anomalies and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of defect samples and ensure reliable anomaly detection in modern manufacturing inspection environments.

Method: HLGFA models cross-resolution feature consistency by aligning high and low-resolution features of normal samples. A shared frozen backbone extracts multi-level features, while high-resolution features guide the refinement of low-resolution ones. During inference, anomalies appear where this alignment fails. A noise-aware data augmentation strategy suppresses unwanted responses.

Result: HLGFA achieved superior performance with 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: HLGFA effectively addresses unsupervised anomaly detection in industrial settings, leveraging high-low resolution feature alignment and data augmentation to achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (UAD) is essential for modern manufacturing inspection, where defect samples are scarce and reliable detection is required. In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.

*Ziqiang Shi,Rujie Liu,Shanshan Yu,Satoshi Munakata,Koichi Shirahata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposing SchröMind, a framework that reduces hallucinations using lightweight training and solving the Schrödinger bridge problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with hallucination issues, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare. The authors aim to address this challenge to improve the reliability of these models.

Method: The framework, SchröMind, solves the Schrödinger bridge problem to map hallucinatory to truthful activations at the token level. It uses lightweight training to achieve this with minimal computational impact.

Result: SchröMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on the POPE and MME benchmarks, reducing hallucinations effectively and retaining the original model's capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates improved reliability and effectiveness in reducing hallucinations, paving the way for safer applications of MLLMs in critical domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.

*Bohan Fu,Guanyi Qin,Fazhan Zhang,Zihao Huang,Mingxuan Li,Runze Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DR.Experts, a prior-driven framework for Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA), addressing limitations in capturing subtle distortions by incorporating reliable distortion priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA models fail to align with human perception due to their inability to effectively capture distortion cues, caused by the lack of reliable distortion priors.

Method: DR.Experts employs a degradation-aware vision-language model for obtaining distortion-specific priors, refines them via a Distortion-Saliency Differential Module, and uses a Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module for final prediction.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing methods on five major BIQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in generalization and data efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating reliable distortion priors leads to higher accuracy and better human perception alignment in BIQA tasks.

Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.

*Michael Baltaxe,Dan Levi,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that improves monocular metric depth estimation by using retrieved neighbors as geometric proxies to improve depth estimation performance for underrepresented classes in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes is a challenge that limits physically intelligent systems. The motivation is to address this limitation and improve metric depth estimation for such scenarios.

Method: The proposed RAD framework uses an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to find and process low-confidence regions by retrieving semantically similar RGB-D context samples. A dual-stream network processes the input and context samples, and a cross-attention module transfers geometric information between reliable point correspondences.

Result: RAD demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on datasets like NYU Depth v2 (29.2% error reduction), KITTI (13.3%), and Cityscapes (7.2%) for underrepresented classes, while maintaining strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The RAD framework successfully utilizes retrieved context to approximate multi-view stereo and achieves improved depth estimation performance, particularly for challenging underrepresented classes in complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) is essential for physically intelligent systems, yet accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes remains a persistent challenge. To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.

*Jiayi Lyu,Leigang Qu,Wenjing Zhang,Hanyu Jiang,Kai Liu,Zhenglin Zhou,Xiaobo Xia,Jian Xue,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate realistic talking-head videos with fine-grained emotion control using a two-stage process involving action unit extraction and AU-driven diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions in talking-head video generation due to insufficient emotion control mechanisms.

Method: The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) disentangling Action Units (AUs) as fine-grained emotional cues using a chain-of-thought mechanism with audio-language models, and (2) synthesizing realistic videos using an AU-driven controllable diffusion model with cross-attention modules.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in emotional realism, lip synchronization, and visual coherence on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AUHead provides a novel framework for fine-grained emotion control in talking-head video generation, significantly enhancing emotional expressiveness and video quality.

Abstract: Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an "emotion-then-AU" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

*Ziqiang Shi,Rujie Liu,Shanshan Yu,Satoshi Munakata,Koichi Shirahata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scalpel, a method to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by refining attention distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucination in LVLMs arising from strong language model priors and misaligned attention across modalities.

Method: The method, Scalpel, adjusts attention activations in LVLMs by predicting trustworthy directions using Gaussian mixture models and entropic optimal transport to refine attention mappings.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior work in reducing hallucinations, achieving state-of-the-art results across various datasets and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scalpel effectively reduces hallucinations in a model- and data-agnostic manner without additional computational demands, enhancing LVLM performance during inference.

Abstract: Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.

*Bo Peng,Yuanwei Hu,Bo Liu,Ling Chen,Jie Lu,Zhen Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering, combining multi-modal representations through vision-language models to enhance clustering performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spectral clustering methods are largely single-modal, failing to utilize the richness of multi-modal data effectively. The authors aim to integrate vision-language modalities.

Method: The proposed method uses Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering with cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. It incorporates semantic and visual proximity for better clustering and utilizes a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism with prompts.

Result: Extensive testing on 16 diverse benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art spectral clustering techniques.

Conclusion: The integration of multi-modal data using pre-trained vision-language models proves effective, promoting stronger clustering accuracy and more robust block-diagonal affinity structures.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality data remains a primary bottleneck in adapting multimodal generative models for medical image editing.

To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities. We construct MieDB-100k via a data curation pipeline leveraging both modality-specific expert models and rule-based data synthetic methods, followed by rigorous manual inspection to ensure clinical fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that model trained with MieDB-100k consistently outperform both open-source and proprietary models while exhibiting strong generalization ability. We anticipate that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for future advancements in specialized medical image editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable low-latency and geometrically consistent visual generation for augmented reality and embodied AI applications, particularly under egocentric visual perspectives.

Method: Proposes an autoregressive framework using occlusion-invariant 3D hand meshes, per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings for disentangling camera and hand motion, and a distillation of bidirectional diffusion models for arbitrary-length video synthesis.

Result: Hand2World improves perceptual quality, 3D geometric consistency, and supports long-term, stable interactive video generation in egocentric interaction benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Hand2World enables plausible egocentric interaction generation, advancing capabilities for augmented reality and AI systems requiring interactive and stable visual outputs.

Abstract: Egocentric interactive world models are essential for augmented reality and embodied AI, where visual generation must respond to user input with low latency, geometric consistency, and long-term stability. We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.

TL;DR: Tele-Omni introduces a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing using text, images, and reference videos, improving scalability and composability in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation and editing methods are task-specific, rely heavily on textual instructions, and lack the ability to handle multimodal inputs or diverse scenarios flexibly.

Method: Tele-Omni combines pretrained multimodal large language models to infer structured intents from multimodal inputs with diffusion-based generators for high-quality video synthesis. A task-aware data processing pipeline unifies multimodal inputs and preserves individual task constraints.

Result: Tele-Omni supports a variety of video-centric tasks, demonstrating strong temporal coherence, visual consistency, and competitive performance across multiple experiments.

Conclusion: Tele-Omni provides a scalable and unified framework for multimodal video generation and editing, enabling effective handling of diverse multimodal instructions and contexts while maintaining high-quality synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware, object-centric method for large-scale change detection in urban areas using LiDAR data, outperforming baselines with notable metrics improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for city planning, change detection, and urban monitoring based on 3D LiDAR mapping, addressing limitations of conventional DSM models, point clouds, and voxel-based approaches.

Method: The proposed method utilizes LiDAR-based multi-resolution alignment, registration normalization, uncertainty calibration, semantic refinements, memory-efficient tiled processing, and optimized instance-level change detection.

Result: The approach was tested on Subiaco, WA datasets from 2023 and 2025, achieving 95.3% accuracy, 90.8% mF1, and 82.9% mIoU, outperforming the baseline Triplet KPConv.

Conclusion: The method offers improved change detection capabilities for urban environments, advancing city-scale monitoring and mapping technologies effectively.

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps enable city planning and change detection, which is essential for municipal compliance, map maintenance, and asset monitoring, including both built structures and urban greenery. Conventional Digital Surface Model (DSM) and image differencing are sensitive to vertical bias and viewpoint mismatch, while original point cloud or voxel models require large memory, assume perfect alignment, and degrade thin structures. We propose an uncertainty-aware, object-centric method for city-scale LiDAR-based change detection. Our method aligns data from different time periods using multi-resolution Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) and a point-to-plane Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method, normalizes elevation, and computes a per-point level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate change decisions. Geometry-based associations are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and optimized using class-constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle split-merge cases. Tiled processing bounds memory and preserves narrow ground changes, while instance-level decisions integrate overlap, displacement, and volumetric differences under local detection gating. We perform experiments on a Subiaco (Western Australia) dataset captured in 2023 and again in 2025. Our method achieves 95.3% accuracy, 90.8% mF1, and 82.9% mIoU, improving over the strongest baseline, Triplet KPConv, by 0.3, 0.6, and 1.1 points, respectively. The datasets are available on IEEE DataPort (2023: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/2023-subiaco-wa-3d-hd-lidar-point-cloud-maps-dataset and 2025: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/2025-subiaco-wa-3d-hd-lidar-gnss-point-cloud-maps-dataset).

*Yue Li,Xin Yi,Dongsheng Shi,Yongyi Cui,Gerard de Melo,Linlin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AGMark, an adaptive watermarking framework, to enhance visual fidelity and reliability in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by dynamically embedding relevant tokens during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve content traceability and intellectual property protection in LVLMs while addressing issues in current watermarking methods such as visual irrelevance, static design, and introduction of low-quality tokens.

Method: AGMark uses a dynamic approach based on attention weights and context-aware cues to identify semantic-critical evidence. It also incorporates token entropy and weight density to adaptively partition vocabulary and embed tokens preserving visual-semantic fidelity.

Result: The empirical results demonstrate AGMark's superior generation quality, improved visual-semantic fidelity during later generation stages, competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36% AUC), and strong attack resilience (at least 88.61% AUC).

Conclusion: AGMark sets a new standard for multi-modal watermarking by effectively balancing visual fidelity, detection precision, and efficiency without compromising inference performance.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of hateful content in online videos harms individuals and disrupts societal harmony, but existing solutions rely heavily on human annotations or lack precise temporal detection.

Method: LELA uses a training-free approach leveraging LLMs and modality-specific captioning. It analyzes videos across five modalities (image, speech, OCR, music, video context) with a multi-stage prompting scheme and includes composition matching to enhance cross-modal reasoning.

Result: LELA demonstrated superior performance compared to training-free baselines on HateMM and MultiHateClip benchmarks. It provides fine-grained temporal localization with strong scalability and interpretability.

Conclusion: LELA establishes itself as an effective, scalable solution for hateful video localization, offering precise and interpretable detection without requiring annotated training data.

Abstract: The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin.

*Hanqing Wang,Mingyu Liu,Xiaoyu Chen,Chengwei MA,Yiming Zhong,Wenti Yin,Yuhao Liu,Zhiqing Cui,Jiahao Yuan,Lu Dai,Zhiyuan Ma,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIDA, a video-based 3D affordance dataset, and proposes VideoAfford, a model for enhanced 3D affordance grounding using dynamic interaction priors and spatial-aware loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods focused on static affordance learning, lacking dynamic and causal context needed for advanced 3D affordance grounding required in robotics.

Method: The authors collect VIDA, a comprehensive dataset, and propose VideoAfford, a multimodal model that incorporates action priors and spatial-aware loss for fine-grained affordance reasoning.

Result: VideoAfford outperforms existing methods in affordance grounding and demonstrates strong open-world affordance reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach, leveraging both video-based data and advanced modeling, provides significant advancements in 3D affordance grounding for robotics, and all resources are made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D affordance grounding aims to highlight the actionable regions on 3D objects, which is crucial for robotic manipulation. Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities. All datasets and code will be publicly released to advance research in this area.

*Siyu Chen,Ting Han,Haoling Huang,Chaolei Wang,Chengzheng Fu,Duxin Zhu,Guorong Cai,Jinhe Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time2General addresses domain-shift and temporal-sampling-shift problems in Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) using a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder and Masked Temporal Consistency Loss for temporally consistent predictions without test-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenge of temporally consistent predictions in video semantic segmentation under domain shift and temporal-sampling shift without relying on direct target labels or test-time adaptation.

Method: The framework introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder to aggregate multi-frame contexts and generate temporally consistent per-frame predictions. Additionally, it uses a Masked Temporal Consistency Loss to regularize prediction discrepancies across varied strides and adopts randomized training strides to handle diverse temporal gaps.

Result: Time2General demonstrates significant improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability, outperforming existing DGSS and VSS baselines across multiple driving benchmarks while operating efficiently at up to 18 FPS.

Conclusion: Time2General enables domain-generalized and temporally stable video segmentation, offering a robust approach to cross-domain and temporal consistency challenges in DGVSS.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a certified pose estimation method using camera images and known target geometry, ensuring safety-critical reliability through formal bounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure safety-critical reliability in cyber-physical systems by providing accurate and trustworthy pose estimation without relying on external, potentially unreliable services like GPS.

Method: The method involves computing pose in 3D using camera images and target geometry, employing reachability analysis and formal neural network verification for formal bounding.

Result: The approach showed efficiency and accuracy in localizing agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The study presents a reliable certified pose estimation framework that performs well in various settings, addressing the need for safety in critical applications.

Abstract: Agents in cyber-physical systems are increasingly entrusted with safety-critical tasks. Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.

*Deyang Jiang,Jing Huang,Xuanle Zhao,Lei Chen,Liming Zheng,Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Zhixiong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TreeCUA, a framework for efficient GUI automation using tree-structured trajectories, collaborative exploration, and adaptive algorithms, improving planning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of scaling GUI planning, which typically requires large and complex datasets, by introducing a system that organizes exploration into tree structures to reduce cost and enhance GUI automation capabilities.

Method: TreeCUA employs a multi-agent collaborative framework for exploration and action verification, uses a tree-based topology for data storage, and incorporates adaptive exploration algorithms along with world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to optimize trajectory generation.

Result: TreeCUA and its extension, TreeCUA-DPO, significantly enhance GUI planning capability, offering improved efficiency and scalability. The experimental results showcase robust performance in both familiar and out-of-domain environments.

Conclusion: TreeCUA streamlines GUI automation by organizing trajectories in tree structures and enhancing exploration through adaptive algorithms. It demonstrates superior scalability and generalization, making it a promising tool for expanding GUI automation capabilities.

Abstract: Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a system that generates realistic and physically valid 3D simulation environments for embodied AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the expensive and unsafe process of real-world data collection for embodied agents and the limitations of existing rule-based and task-specific scene-generation systems.

Method: The SAGE framework understands user-specified tasks, integrates multiple layout and object generators with critics for evaluation, and iteratively refines scenes until they meet user intent and physical validity.

Result: SAGE generates realistic and diverse simulation-ready environments that improve policy training, with scalability and generalization to unseen objects and layouts.

Conclusion: The study shows that simulation-driven scaling via SAGE can advance embodied AI policy training and generalization while offering a practical and efficient alternative to real-world data collection.

Abstract: Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Addresses liver fibrosis by combining semi-supervised liver segmentation and patch-based fibrosis staging through multiparametric MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle liver fibrosis detection challenges like limited annotated data, domain shifts, and multimodal MRI intricacies.

Method: A multi-task deep learning framework involving semi-supervised liver segmentation and patch-based classification for fibrosis staging.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy on independent test sets, handling ID and OOD cases with three or seven-channel MRIs.

Conclusion: The method is impactful in liver disease detection with its open-source code facilitating future research advancements.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

*Sandesh Hegde,Jaison Saji Chacko,Debarshi Banerjee,Uma Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline for fine-grained referring image segmentation using a decoupled reason-then-segment approach combined with a vision-language model (VLM) and a frozen segmenter for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance in fine-grained referring image segmentation by introducing a new pipeline that effectively reasons and segments without requiring supervised reasoning-chain annotations.

Method: The method employs Qwen3-VL models finetuned on a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and uses a promptable frozen segmenter (SAM 2). A variant also leverages additional training based on GRefCOCO datasets for optimizing mask qualities.

Result: The proposed models achieve significantly higher performance metrics such as cIoU, mIoU, and target accuracy across multiple datasets, outperforming baseline models like Seg-Zero and Seg-R1.

Conclusion: The GenSeg-R1 framework demonstrates improved performance in segmentation tasks while introducing effective no-target detection and reasoning-chain-free optimization methods.

Abstract: We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.
  Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation.
  We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.

*Ruisi Zhao,Haoren Zheng,Zongxin Yang,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stroke3D introduces a novel framework to generate rigged 3D meshes directly from 2D strokes and text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods struggle with creating animatable models, and rigging techniques lack precise control over skeleton structures.

Method: Stroke3D employs a two-stage pipeline: skeletal graph generation using Sk-VAE and Sk-DiT, and enhanced textured mesh synthesis with TextuRig and SKA-DPO.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Stroke3D successfully generates plausible skeletons and high-quality rigged 3D meshes.

Conclusion: Stroke3D establishes a user-friendly workflow for producing animatable 3D assets and is the first to link 2D strokes to rigged 3D mesh generation.

Abstract: Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.

*Laura Paul,Holger Rauhut,Martin Burger,Samira Kabri,Tim Roith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid approach to enhance the automated detection of craquelure (cracks) in paintings using deep generative models and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated crack detection in paintings is essential for evaluating degradation and aiding restoration, but current methods struggle due to the complexity of art scenes and the similarity between cracks and artistic features.

Method: The authors formulated crack detection as an inverse problem, utilizing a deep generative model to represent the artwork while deploying a variational functional and crack prior for segmenting crack structures.

Result: The approach provides a pixel-level map of crack locations in paintings, separating cracks from crack-like artistic features effectively.

Conclusion: This method improves the accuracy of detecting craquelure in digitized paintings, supporting conservation efforts through reliable analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS) to improve audio-driven talking head generation, addressing lip synchronization and facial movement inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter that contribute to the uncanny valley in talking head generation.

Method: Introduces frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to model different facial regions explicitly and high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment via pretrained models.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FG-3DGS offers temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation by enhancing modeling and rendering techniques.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is a core component of digital avatars, and 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown strong performance in real-time rendering of high-fidelity talking heads. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.

Result: A detailed analysis of attack vectors targeting vision system surfaces was conducted, highlighting their effects on CIA principles.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into designing robust security measures for CAV vision systems to ensure safety and reliability in autonomous navigation.

Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of vision systems in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which is critical for developing Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities. Safe and reliable CAV navigation undeniably depends on robust vision systems that enable accurate detection of objects, lane markings, and traffic signage. We analyze the key sensors and vision components essential for CAV navigation to derive a reference architecture for CAV vision system (CAVVS). This reference architecture provides a basis for identifying potential attack surfaces of CAVVS. Subsequently, we elaborate on identified attack vectors targeting each attack surface, rigorously evaluating their implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of attack vector dynamics in vision systems, which is crucial for formulating robust security measures that can uphold the principles of the CIA triad.

*Kawtar Zaher,Ilyass Moummad,Olivier Buisson,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning approach using binary communication between teacher and student networks, leading to structured and compact visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current self-supervised learning methods, which lack control over how visual information is structured across representation dimensions.

Method: The student network predicts multi-label binary messages generated by the teacher network, with a binary cross-entropy objective and a coding-rate regularization term. Reinitializing the projection head helps to stabilize embeddings across encodings.

Result: The proposed method achieves consistent enhancements over continuous baselines in tasks like image classification, retrieval, dense prediction, and even under domain shifts.

Conclusion: The framework develops compact and semantic binary representations, demonstrating reusability and rich information encoding for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines geographical representation in text-to-image datasets, identifying biases toward wealthier, English-speaking countries and limited representation of less-developed regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models fail to produce geographically representative images, leading to questions about the geographic and cultural diversity in their training data.

Method: The authors use LLMs to extract location data from image-caption pairs in datasets like Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions, profiling the geographical distribution of their image samples.

Result: The study shows a disproportionate representation of the US, UK, and Canada (48% of samples) and under-representation of South American and African countries (1.8% and 3.8%). There is a correlation between GDP and data representation (ρ = 0.82). Results also reveal skewed representation in non-English subsets, and that higher representation doesn't equate to greater diversity.

Conclusion: Text-to-image model datasets exhibit substantial geographic and cultural representation biases, which limit the real-world applicability and fairness of these models.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\%$ and $3.8\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.

*Tong Zhang,Honglin Lin,Zhou Liu,Chong Chen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciFlow-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate scientific diagram generation focusing on structural correctness over visual similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in properly assessing structural correctness in scientific diagram generation, as current models often fail at this despite producing visually plausible results.

Method: SciFlow-Bench evaluates pixel-based outputs as black-box image generators using a round-trip protocol where generated diagrams are inverse-parsed into graphs for structural comparison.

Result: The study demonstrates that maintaining structural correctness in diagram generation remains a significant challenge, especially for diagrams with complex topology.

Conclusion: SciFlow-Bench highlights the importance of structure-aware evaluation in advancing scientific diagram generation systems.

Abstract: Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.

*Hojun Song,Heejung Choi,Aro Kim,Chae-yeong Song,Gahyeon Kim,Soo Ye Kim,Jaehyup Lee,Sang-hyo Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompSplat, a framework designed to tackle challenges in novel view synthesis from heavily compressed and unposed long real-world video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address challenges in novel view synthesis from real-world videos, such as pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortions that become aggravated under heavy compression, which has not been sufficiently explored in prior studies.

Method: CompSplat employs compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to model and compensate for frame-wise compression characteristics. This approach helps improve consistency and geometric accuracy in the reconstruction process.

Result: CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy on challenging benchmarks (e.g., Tanks and Temples, Free, Hike), showing significant improvement over existing novel view synthesis methods in scenarios with severe compression.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves robustness and geometric consistency in novel view synthesis under challenging real-world conditions, particularly heavy compression, making it a valuable improvement for applications like cultural heritage preservation and immersive media.

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by analyzing internal model instability and proposing a training-free decoding method, SAKED, to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs present security and reliability risks in practical use, motivating a deeper understanding of how internal knowledge instability contributes to these issues.

Method: The authors conduct empirical analyses to identify hallucination patterns in attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens. They introduce SAKED, which uses a Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to enhance decoding stability and mitigate hallucinations without retraining.

Result: SAKED achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction across various LVLM models, tasks, and benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed SAKED method improves the reliability of LVLMs by addressing instability and suppressing hallucinations, offering a practical and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.

*Yijie Lin,Guofeng Ding,Haochen Zhou,Haobin Li,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARK, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal retrieval across knowledge domains and reasoning skills, addressing the gap in professional-level diagnostics and reasoning complexity in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the evaluation of multimodal retrieval systems by addressing limitations in existing benchmarks which lack a focus on professional knowledge and complex reasoning capabilities.

Method: The ARK benchmark assesses retrieval on both unimodal and multimodal queries using 16 visual data types, with targeted hard negatives to enforce multi-step reasoning.

Result: Testing 23 retrieval models reveals a performance gap in knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks, particularly in fine-grained reasoning.

Conclusion: Simple enhancements improve performance, but there remains significant scope for advancing retrieval systems to handle complex reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive model addressing information loss in discrete visual tokens to achieve unified understanding and generation across text and vision data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias in vision-language models (VLMs) that use a hybrid interface (discrete text tokens and continuous visual features), which limits their ability in self-supervised learning and fully unified modeling.

Method: The authors propose Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive model using improved discrete visual tokenization to enhance multimodal understanding and generation.

Result: Kelix closes the performance gap between discrete and continuous visual representations, overcoming issues with limited code capacity in previous discrete visual tokens.

Conclusion: Kelix achieves a unified approach to multimodal comprehension and generation, successfully overcoming limitations of prior vision-language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.

TL;DR: Reason-IAD is a framework for industrial anomaly detection, combining category-specific textual descriptions and entropy-driven reasoning with visual patch integration for improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper recognizes the shortcomings of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in detecting fine-grained, category-specific anomalies in industrial applications.

Method: The framework uses a retrieval-augmented knowledge module for domain-specific defect descriptions and a latent reasoning mechanism driven by entropy-based rewards. It also incorporates informative image patches into the reasoning process.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Reason-IAD has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in industrial anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The proposed Reason-IAD framework effectively enhances detection accuracy and interpretability through domain-specific textual reasoning and dynamic visual analysis, paving the way for more precise industrial anomaly detection solutions.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.

TL;DR: Code2World, a vision-language coder, leverages renderable code generation to predict visual states in GUI environments, achieving high visual fidelity and fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to achieve a balance between high visual fidelity and fine-grained controllability in predicting GUI states, necessitating an advanced solution.

Method: The paper introduces Code2World, which utilizes an HTML-based dataset (AndroidCode) created by translating GUI trajectories. It employs techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning and Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning to adapt vision-language models for precise code prediction.

Result: Code2World-8B outperforms key models in next UI prediction and significantly improves navigation success rates, boosting other systems like Gemini-2.5-Flash by 9.5% in AndroidWorld navigation.

Conclusion: Code2World advances the capabilities of autonomous GUI agents by achieving high-fidelity, controllable visual simulation through innovative code prediction methods, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study uses a real-world Processing-In-Memory (PIM) system, UPMEM, to optimize and characterize graph algorithm performance compared to CPU and GPU baselines. It identifies hardware bottlenecks and proposes future enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the performance and energy efficiency limitations of processor-centric graph processing (CPU and GPU), which are memory-bound due to significant data movement, by exploring the capabilities of real-world PIM systems.

Method: The paper implements representative graph algorithms on UPMEM's PIM system, characterizes their performance, compares results with CPU and GPU baselines, and identifies bottlenecks to guide future PIM hardware design.

Result: The study finds that optimized data partitioning maximizes PIM performance, identifies key hardware limitations (e.g., instruction-level parallelism, DMA engine inefficiencies, interconnect bottlenecks), and outlines enhancement opportunities for PIM architecture.

Conclusion: Processing-In-Memory is promising for graph workloads but requires specific hardware and architectural improvements to overcome bottlenecks and improve computation, memory, and communication subsystems.

Abstract: Processing large-scale graph datasets is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Processor-centric CPU and GPU architectures, commonly used for graph applications, often face bottlenecks caused by extensive data movement between the processor and memory units due to low data reuse. As a result, these applications are often memory-bound, limiting both performance and energy efficiency due to excessive data transfers. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) offers a promising approach to mitigate data movement bottlenecks by integrating computation directly within or near memory. Although several previous studies have introduced custom PIM proposals for graph processing, they do not leverage real-world PIM systems.
  This work aims to explore the capabilities and characteristics of common graph algorithms on a real-world PIM system to accelerate data-intensive graph workloads. To this end, we (1) implement representative graph algorithms on UPMEM's general-purpose PIM architecture; (2) characterize their performance and identify key bottlenecks; (3) compare results against CPU and GPU baselines; and (4) derive insights to guide future PIM hardware design.
  Our study underscores the importance of selecting optimal data partitioning strategies across PIM cores to maximize performance. Additionally, we identify critical hardware limitations in current PIM architectures and emphasize the need for future enhancements across computation, memory, and communication subsystems. Key opportunities for improvement include increasing instruction-level parallelism, developing improved DMA engines with non-blocking capabilities, and enabling direct interconnection networks among PIM cores to reduce data transfer overheads.

TL;DR: LLM-CoOpt is a framework that improves LLM inference efficiency through three strategies: Opt-KV for memory optimization, Opt-GQA for computation restructuring, and Opt-Pa for handling long-sequence processing, yielding better throughput and latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>

Motivation: The paper addresses critical inefficiencies in LLM inference, such as memory bottlenecks, computational redundancy, and challenges with long-sequence processing.

Method: The framework employs three strategies: Key-Value Cache Optimization (Opt-KV) for memory utilization, Grouped-Query Attention (Opt-GQA) for reducing computational complexity, and Paged Attention (Opt-Pa) for efficient handling of long-sequences.

Conclusion: LLM-CoOpt offers a viable, high-performance solution for optimizing large-scale language model inference in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Major challenges in LLMs inference remain frequent memory bandwidth bottlenecks, computational redundancy, and inefficiencies in long-sequence processing. To address these issues, we propose LLM-CoOpt, a comprehensive algorithmhardware co-design framework aimed at improving both throughput and latency in LLM inference. LLM-CoOpt integrates three key strategies: (1) Key-Value Cache Optimization, termed Opt-KV, which improves memory access efficiency by optimizing both KV cache write and read paths, and introduces FP8 quantization to reduce memory footprint while maintaining accuracy; (2) Grouped-Query Attention for Computational Efficiency, termed Opt-GQA, which reduces the overall computational complexity by restructuring multi-head self-attention into grouped-query attention with shared key-value projections, enabling higher throughput and lower resource consumption; (3) Paged Attention for Long- Sequence Processing, termed Opt-Pa, which adopts a two-step strategy to first segment long sequences into manageable chunks and then apply lazy memory mapping and computation, significantly reducing memory pressure and improving performance on long-context inputs.Experiments on the LLaMa-13BGPTQ model demonstrate that LLM-CoOpt increases inference throughput by up to 13.43%, reduces latency by up to 16.79%, and maintains model accuracy. These results confirm that LLM-CoOpt provides a practical, high-performance optimization path for real-world inference of large-scale language models.

### [171] [The Coordination Criterion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09435)
*Joseph M. Hellerstein*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper provides a criterion to determine when coordination is intrinsically required for distributed systems, using a monotonicity property of specifications in asynchronous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and formalize the conditions under which coordination is unavoidable for distributed system specifications and to find a general criterion applicable across models and concepts.

Method: The study defines and leverages a Coordination Criterion based on monotonicity within Lamport histories and observable outcomes, independent of specific programming or protocol assumptions.

Result: The authors establish that only monotone specifications with respect to history extension can achieve coordination-free implementations, explaining classical distributed results as instances of this rule.

Conclusion: The Coordination Criterion serves as a unifying principle to distinguish between systems requiring coordination and those that do not, clarifying distributed computing limitations and potential scalability.

Abstract: When is coordination intrinsically required by a distributed specification, rather than imposed by a particular protocol or implementation strategy? We give a general answer using minimal assumptions. In an asynchronous message-passing model, we show that a specification admits a coordination-free implementation if and only if it is monotone with respect to history extension under an appropriate order on observable outcomes.
  This Coordination Criterion is stated directly over Lamport histories -- partially ordered executions under happens-before -- and specification-defined observable outcomes, without assuming any particular programming language, object implementation, or protocol structure. It yields a sharp boundary between specifications that can be implemented without coordination and those for which coordination is unavoidable. The criterion provides a uniform explanation for a range of classical results, including CAP-style impossibility, CALM-style coordination-freedom, agreement and snapshot tasks, transactional isolation levels, and invariant confluence -- all instances of the same underlying semantic phenomenon.

*Allen Clement,Natacha Crooks,Neil Giridharan,Alex Shamis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gauss, a modular reconfiguration engine for state-machine replication (SMR) that allows independent upgrades of consensus protocols and their components with minimal downtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-machine replication (SMR) architectures limit flexibility and require downtime for transitions to new consensus protocols, lacking modularity and adaptability for continuous deployment.

Method: The paper proposes Gauss, a reconfiguration engine that separates the inner consensus log from the outer log, enabling independent upgrades of membership, failure thresholds, and even consensus protocols.

Result: Gauss enables uninterrupted evolution of the SMR stack, demonstrated through its implementation in the Rialo blockchain, supporting diverse protocol setups.

Conclusion: The modular approach of Gauss enhances maintainability, flexibility, and operations of production SMRs, ensuring minimal downtime and greater adaptability.

Abstract: Production state-machine replication (SMR) implementations are complex, multi-layered architectures comprising data dissemination, ordering, execution, and reconfiguration components. Existing research consensus protocols rarely discuss reconfiguration. Those that do tightly couple membership changes to a specific algorithm. This prevents the independent upgrade of individual building blocks and forces expensive downtime when transitioning to new protocol implementations. Instead, modularity is essential for maintainability and system evolution in production deployments. We present Gauss, a reconfiguration engine designed to treat consensus protocols as interchangeable modules. By introducing a distinction between a consensus protocol's inner log and a sanitized outer log exposed to the RSM node, Gauss allows engineers to upgrade membership, failure thresholds, and the consensus protocol itself independently and with minimal global downtime. Our initial evaluation on the Rialo blockchain shows that this separation of concerns enables a seamless evolution of the SMR stack across a sequence of diverse protocol implementations.

Abstract: ARM SVE and RISC-V RVV are emerging vector architectures in high-end processors that support vectorization of flexible vector length. In this work, we leverage an important workload for quantum computing, quantum state-vector simulations, to understand whether high-performance portability can be achieved in a vector-length agnostic (VLA) design. We propose a VLA design and optimization techniques critical for achieving high performance, including VLEN-adaptive memory layout adjustment, load buffering, fine-grained loop control, and gate fusion-based arithmetic intensity adaptation. We provide an implementation in Google's Qsim and evaluate five quantum circuits of up to 36 qubits on three ARM processors, including NVIDIA Grace, AWS Graviton3, and Fujitsu A64FX. By defining new metrics and PMU events to quantify vectorization activities, we draw generic insights for future VLA designs. Our single-source implementation of VLA quantum simulations achieves up to 4.5x speedup on A64FX, 2.5x speedup on Grace, and 1.5x speedup on Graviton.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the advantages and limitations of Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) for large-scale MoE models, finding that it performs better under specific hardware and model conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the performance boundaries of Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) compared to Expert Parallelism (EP) in addressing challenges of memory capacity and bandwidth in large-scale MoE models.

Method: A systematic analysis is conducted by extending the roofline model to include communication-level considerations, investigating interconnect bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, and Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU).

Result: AFD faces limitations such as a dead zone in HFU improvement due to bandwidth constraints and higher imbalance penalties in node-level scaling. Still, it shows better performance with specific hardware and model configurations (e.g., Superpod-class hardware and coarse-grained models).

Conclusion: AFD is not universally optimal but is promising for specific combinations of hardware and model features, providing performance benefits under ideal conditions.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale MoE models presents challenges in memory capacity and bandwidth for expert activation. While Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) has emerged as a potential architecture to decouple compute and memory resources, its performance boundaries compared to standard large-scale Expert Parallelism (EP) remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of AFD by extending the roofline model to the communication level, correlating interconnect bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, and Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU). Our analysis reveals a dead zone on standard clusters: increasing FFN instance count fails to improve HFU as computational workload is capped by scale-out bandwidth, causing operator active time to shrink relative to the fixed latency budget. We further show that AFD's discrete node-level scaling incurs higher imbalance penalties than EP's continuous batch adjustment. Nevertheless, these limitations diminish under specific conditions: Superpod-class hardware with abundant interconnect bandwidth and models with coarse-grained experts and lower sparsity are more likely to benefit from AFD. These findings position AFD as a promising approach for specific hardware-model combinations rather than a universal solution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVFetcher, a GPU-compatible system for efficient remote KV cache reuse in LLMs, leveraging video codecs to improve performance in low-bandwidth conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address inefficiencies in remote KV cache reuse, especially in bandwidth-limited networks, while avoiding the overhead of heavyweight decompression techniques.

Method: The paper proposes KVFetcher with two key techniques: a codec-friendly tensor layout for compact compression of KV caches and an efficient pipeline to manage transmission, decoding, and restoration on GPUs.

Result: KVFetcher demonstrates up to 3.51x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while preserving lossless accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: KVFetcher efficiently enables remote KV cache reuse with improved transmission speeds and low latency, making it suitable for diverse GPU settings.

Abstract: Remote KV cache reuse fetches KV cache for identical contexts from remote storage, avoiding recomputation, accelerating LLM inference. While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in graph learning transformers for graph-level tasks by presenting a novel serialized token paradigm, leading to state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph learning methods using transformers suffer from an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations due to the single token paradigm.

Method: The paper introduces a serialized token paradigm by aggregating node signals into serialized graph tokens using a graph serialization method, incorporating automatic positional encoding. It employs stacked self-attention layers for encoding token sequences and modeling complex interactions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple graph-level benchmarks and exhibits effectiveness through ablation studies.

Conclusion: This approach enhances graph representation learning by overcoming the limitations of the single token paradigm, offering an effective method to model complex graph token interactions.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated success in graph learning, particularly for node-level tasks. However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies. Our method can yield more expressive graph representations by modeling complex interactions among multiple graph tokens. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several graph-level benchmarks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

*Jinjin Guo,Yexin Li,Zhichao Huang,Jun Fang,Zhiyuan Liu,Chao Liu,Pengzhang Liu,Qixia Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE) to address limitations in multimodal contrastive learning caused by spectral imbalance and feature entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from issues in multimodal contrastive learning, where high-dimensional embeddings are narrow and spectral structure is poorly utilized, leading to difficulties in model generalization.

Method: The authors propose SDE, which uses singular value decomposition to categorize feature dimensions into task-relevant signals, ancillary correlations, and irrelevant noise. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement amplifies meaningful components, coupled with a dual-domain contrastive loss for feature and spectral alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDE improves robustness, generalization, and performance on large-scale multimodal benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: SDE is an effective and integrable method in multimodal contrastive learning pipelines, enhancing representation richness and robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal contrastive learning has recently achieved impressive success in learning rich and transferable representations, yet it remains fundamentally limited by the uniform treatment of feature dimensions and the neglect of the intrinsic spectral structure of the learned features. Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDE integrates seamlessly with existing contrastive pipelines, offering an effective solution for multimodal representation learning.

Conclusion: With metaplastic design, Palimpsa significantly enhances memory capacity and stability, offering a transformative approach for in-context learning in transformers.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) in transformers acts as an online associative memory and is believed to underpin their high performance on complex sequence processing tasks. However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity. Our experiments show that Palimpsa consistently outperforms baselines on the Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) benchmark and on Commonsense Reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: PatientTPP is a neural TPP model trained on clinical data to predict obesity-related risks and costs more effectively than BMI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve risk stratification in overweight or obese patients for better preventive care and efficient resource allocation.

Method: Developed and trained PatientTPP, a neural temporal point process model incorporating static features, numeric data, and clinical knowledge on over 500,000 patient histories.

Result: PatientTPP enables better prediction of obesity-related outcomes and stratifies patients for future cardiovascular healthcare costs more effectively than BMI.

Conclusion: PatientTPP offers a general, interpretable tool for modeling patient risks with significant potential for obesity care and economic targeting.

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification in patients with overweight or obesity is critical for guiding preventive care and allocating high-cost therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. We present PatientTPP, a neural temporal point process (TPP) model trained on over 500,000 real-world clinical trajectories to learn patient representations from sequences of diagnoses, labs, and medications. We extend existing TPP modeling approaches to include static and numeric features and incorporate clinical knowledge for event encoding. PatientTPP representations support downstream prediction tasks, including classification of obesity-associated outcomes in low-risk individuals, even for events not explicitly modeled during training. In health economic evaluation, PatientTPP outperformed body mass index in stratifying patients by future cardiovascular-related healthcare costs, identifying higher-risk patients more efficiently. By modeling both the type and timing of clinical events, PatientTPP offers an interpretable, general-purpose foundation for patient risk modeling with direct applications to obesity-related care and cost targeting.

### [180] [Looping Back to Move Forward: Recursive Transformers for Efficient and Flexible Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09080)
*Ruihan Xu,Yuting Gao,Lan Wang,Jianing Li,Weihao Chen,Qingpei Guo,Ming Yang,Shiliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RecursiveVLM, a recursive architecture for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that recycles parameters for enhanced multimodal representations without increasing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make large multimodal models more efficient by utilizing recursive strategies to enhance model performance without expanding their parameter size, addressing inefficiencies during training and inference.

Method: The RecursiveVLM is proposed with two key innovations: a Recursive Connector for aligning features across recursive steps and a Monotonic Recursion Loss to progressively enhance output at each recursion depth.

Result: RecursiveVLM shows consistent performance improvements, with +3% gains over standard Transformers and +7% gains over vanilla recursive baselines.

Conclusion: The strategic use of recursion in LMMs is both computationally efficient and adaptable to different resource constraints, presenting a pathway for optimized and scalable multimodal processing.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks, yet their vast parameter counts are often underutilized during both training and inference. In this work, we embrace the idea of looping back to move forward: reusing model parameters through recursive refinement to extract stronger multimodal representations without increasing model size. We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available. Experiments show consistent gains of +3% over standard Transformers and +7% over vanilla recursive baselines, demonstrating that strategic looping is a powerful path toward efficient, deployment-adaptive LMMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMamba enhances long-term time series forecasting by addressing non-stationary patterns through specialized modules tailored for trend and seasonal components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing Mamba-based forecasting models on non-stationary time series datasets.

Method: Introduced DMamba, leveraging seasonal-trend decomposition with separate modules: a variable-direction Mamba encoder for seasonal dynamics and an MLP for trend relationships.

Result: DMamba outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across diverse datasets, improving accuracy for both trend and seasonal components.

Conclusion: Aligning model architecture complexity with time series components achieves superior forecasting results, setting a new SOTA benchmark.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown potential in long-term time series forecasting. However, existing Mamba-based architectures often struggle with datasets characterized by non-stationary patterns. A key observation from time series theory is that the statistical nature of inter-variable relationships differs fundamentally between the trend and seasonal components of a decomposed series. Trend relationships are often driven by a few common stochastic factors or long-run equilibria, suggesting that they reside on a lower-dimensional manifold. In contrast, seasonal relationships involve dynamic, high-dimensional interactions like phase shifts and amplitude co-movements, requiring more expressive modeling. In this paper, we propose DMamba, a novel forecasting model that explicitly aligns architectural complexity with this component-specific characteristic. DMamba employs seasonal-trend decomposition and processes the components with specialized, differentially complex modules: a variable-direction Mamba encoder captures the rich, cross-variable dynamics within the seasonal component, while a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) suffices to learn from the lower-dimensional inter-variable relationships in the trend component. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DMamba sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), consistently outperforming both recent Mamba-based architectures and leading decomposition-based models.

This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference. Recent advances in automated search for optimal hybrid parallelization strategies using cost models are also discussed. Moreover, we present case studies with mainstream architecture categories to reveal empirical insights to guide researchers and practitioners in parallelism strategy selection. Finally, we highlight open challenges and limitations of current LLM training paradigms and outline promising directions for the next generation of large scale model development.

TL;DR: The paper presents Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), which combines network science and AI to handle data scarcity and noise. It introduces the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism to prioritize domain-invariant structural features for improved anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of transferring knowledge across radically different domains under data scarcity and stochastic noise.

Method: Formalizes X-CDTL framework, combining network science and explainable AI, and introduces IIT mechanism to prioritize domain-invariant structural anchors.

Result: Improved anomaly detection with 56% better decision stability under extreme noise compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: X-CDTL reveals shared structural laws across domains, advancing machine learning as a tool for scientific discovery.

Abstract: The capacity to transfer knowledge across scientific domains relies on shared organizational principles. However, existing transfer-learning methodologies often fail to bridge radically heterogeneous systems, particularly under severe data scarcity or stochastic noise. This study formalizes Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), a framework unifying network science and explainable artificial intelligence to identify structural invariants that generalize across biological, linguistic, molecular, and social networks. By introducing the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism, the framework prioritizes domain-invariant structural anchors over idiosyncratic, highly discriminative features. In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56\% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adapted definitions of Rashomon sets for Federated Learning (FL) using three distinct perspectives to address fairness, privacy, and robustness in decentralized model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing definitions of Rashomon sets do not naturally extend to FL environments, where privacy preservation and heterogeneous client data distribution pose challenges.

Method: The paper formalizes Rashomon sets in FL, refines multiplicity metrics under FL's privacy constraints, and develops a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline tested on benchmark datasets.

Result: Empirical studies demonstrate the utility of the federated Rashomon set definitions for deploying models attuned to local data and fairness considerations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves model transparency in FL, enabling alignment with diverse client requirements while addressing fairness, privacy, and robustness.

Abstract: The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.

*Elisa Roldan,Tasneem Sabir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SpinCastML, an open-source tool enabling chemically informed inverse design for electrospinning, predicting fiber diameter distributions and reducing trial-and-error experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current electrospinning methods lack a framework for inverse design that integrates chemical constraints and predicts full fiber diameter distributions.

Method: SpinCastML combines machine learning, Inverse Monte Carlo methods, a large curated dataset, and structured sampling to predict and design fiber diameters and distributions.

Result: SpinCastML achieves high accuracy (R2 > 0.92) in predicting and designing fiber distributions, with <1% error for success rates between predictions and experiments.

Conclusion: The tool transforms electrospinning design into a reproducible, efficient, and data-driven process, promoting sustainable manufacturing of nanofibers for diverse applications.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a powerful technique for producing micro to nanoscale fibers with application specific architectures. Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software. SpinCastML reduces experimental waste, accelerates discovery, and democratizes access to advanced modeling, establishing distribution aware inverse design as a new standard for sustainable nanofiber manufacturing across biomedical, filtration, and energy applications.

*Camille Little,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra,Genevera Allen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel methods to measure the contribution of individual features to a model's fairness in machine learning, addressing gaps in fairness interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trust and accountability issues that emerge from the opaque nature of machine learning models, particularly in the context of fairness. The study aims to explore feature importance in promoting fair and interpretable models.

Method: This paper proposes two methods: 1) a permutation-based approach to measure model fairness before and after altering feature values, and 2) an occlusion-based score that trains models with and without specific features, leveraging minipatch learning for computational efficiency.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed metrics across various predictive tasks, emphasizing their scalability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed methods provide practical tools to evaluate the influence of features on fairness, contributing to responsible machine learning practices.

Abstract: As machine learning models increasingly impact society, their opaque nature poses challenges to trust and accountability, particularly in fairness contexts. Understanding how individual features influence model outcomes is crucial for building interpretable and equitable models. While feature importance metrics for accuracy are well-established, methods for assessing feature contributions to fairness remain underexplored. We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning. Our empirical results reflect the simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed metrics for multiple predictive tasks. Both methods offer simple, scalable, and interpretable solutions to quantify the influence of features on fairness, providing new tools for responsible machine learning development.

*Lei You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the problem of efficiently selecting and verifying valuable information from numerous AI-generated candidates under limited attention, proposing a framework called Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of generative AI systems creates a challenge of effectively leveraging vast outputs while decision-makers have limited capacity to verify only a small portion, necessitating an optimized selection process.

Method: The study introduces ACI, which divides the process into a cheap screening stage and a resource-intensive verification stage, analyzing the achievable reduction in uncertainty (epistemic throughput) as per Bayes log-loss.

Result: A 'JaKoB' scaling law is introduced, indicating epistemic throughput can scale as a mix of linear and square-root terms of the verification-resource-to-screening-quality ratio, enabling significant gains in knowledge acquisition via efficient resource allocation.

Conclusion: Expanding cheap screening can amplify the effects of scarce expensive verification, especially when screening quality and informative records align; though its impact diminishes for light-tailed score distributions in extreme low-verification scenarios.

Abstract: Recent generative and tool-using AI systems can surface a large volume of candidates at low marginal cost, yet only a small fraction can be checked carefully. This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare. We further show that this scaling is tight in a weak-screening limit, and that in the sparse-verification regime ($B \ll K$), substantial leverage requires heavy-tailed score distributions; for light-tailed scores the amplification is only logarithmic.

*Awa Khouna,Julien Ferry,Thibaut Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized algorithm for counterfactual explanations in tree ensembles using nearest-region search and volumetric KD-trees, achieving faster and globally optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating counterfactual explanations in tree ensembles are either suboptimal or computationally infeasible for interactive applications.

Method: The authors propose counterfactual maps by leveraging the geometric structure of labeled hyperrectangles to cast counterfactual search as generalized Voronoi cell identification, using a KD-tree-based algorithm.

Result: Experimental analyses reveal globally optimal counterfactuals with millisecond-level query times, significantly outperforming existing approaches in speed and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an exact, efficient solution for counterfactual explanations, offering practical utility in high-stakes applications requiring interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are a central tool in interpretable machine learning, yet computing them exactly for complex models remains challenging. For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.
  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.
  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares the data efficiency of optimizers like Shampoo and Muon to element-wise algorithms such as Adam and Signum, finding Shampoo more efficient and proposing a novel perspective on its operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship, differences, and relative data efficiency of structured optimizers (Shampoo, Muon) compared to unstructured optimizers (Adam, Signum).

Method: Conducted extensive experiments on language models to compare the performance of the optimizers and analyzed the underlying mechanics of Shampoo's updates in terms of Muon and parameter shapes.

Result: Shampoo showed higher token efficiency compared to Muon, comparable to Adam's advantage over Signum. Shampoo's updates could be expressed as adapted Muon updates and were linked to the semi-orthogonal properties of parameter shapes.

Conclusion: Shampoo's superior performance stems from its application to weight matrices, providing a more effective mechanism than spectral descent and other variance adaptation interpretations.

Abstract: Optimizers leveraging the matrix structure in neural networks, such as Shampoo and Muon, are more data-efficient than element-wise algorithms like Adam and Signum. While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective and comprehensive evaluation frameworks for language model compression techniques beyond knowledge-centric benchmarks.

Method: UniComp evaluates compressed models across performance, reliability, and efficiency using capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks, alongside hardware-aware efficiency analysis.

Result: Findings include a consistent knowledge bias in compression methods, quantization's efficiency-to-performance trade-offs, distillation's runtime acceleration, and task-specific calibration benefits.

Conclusion: UniComp highlights varied impacts of compression techniques and emphasizes the need for task-specific approaches to optimize different aspects of LLM performance.

Abstract: Model compression is increasingly essential for deploying large language models (LLMs), yet existing evaluations are limited in method coverage and focus primarily on knowledge-centric benchmarks. Thus, we introduce UniComp, a unified evaluation framework for comparing pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. UniComp evaluates compressed models along three dimensions: performance, reliability, and efficiency, using a diverse set of capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks together with a hardware-aware efficiency analysis. Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of neural networks producing unconstrained predictions that could violate operational or safety requirements.

Method: Added a differentiable repair layer for constraint satisfaction and adaptive relaxation to stabilize training.

Result: Improved objective quality and reliable constraint satisfaction across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SnareNet is effective for producing feasible, high-quality mappings in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used as surrogate solvers and control policies, but unconstrained predictions can violate physical, operational, or safety requirements. We propose SnareNet, a feasibility-controlled architecture for learning mappings whose outputs must satisfy input-dependent nonlinear constraints. SnareNet appends a differentiable repair layer that navigates in the constraint map's range space, steering iterates toward feasibility and producing a repaired output that satisfies constraints to a user-specified tolerance. To stabilize end-to-end training, we introduce adaptive relaxation, which designs a relaxed feasible set that snares the neural network at initialization and shrinks it into the feasible set, enabling early exploration and strict feasibility later in training. On optimization-learning and trajectory planning benchmarks, SnareNet consistently attains improved objective quality while satisfying constraints more reliably than prior work.

TL;DR: The paper investigates geometric signals in LLMs' internal states to predict hallucination without relying heavily on external validation. It introduces normalization to improve detection across varied domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of hallucination in generative models, especially in scenarios without access to external ground truth for validation.

Method: The study uses synthetic datasets to analyze geometric statistics and their correlation with distinct properties of hallucinations. It also introduces and evaluates a normalization method to handle domain shifts.

Result: Geometric statistics were found effective in detecting different types of hallucinations. Normalization significantly improved multi-domain detection performance with a notable AUROC gain.

Conclusion: Geometric detection methods can help identify hallucinations with reduced dependency on external validation. Normalization reduces sensitivity to domain shifts, enhancing robustness in varied applications.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a barrier to deploying generative models in high-consequence applications. This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.

Motivation: Address the challenge of contextual bandit learning with large action spaces by reducing the problem to offline regression for practical application and optimal performance.

Method: The OE2D algorithm integrates the concept of 'exploitative F-design' to balance exploration and exploitation, and analyzes the problem using a novel measure: Decision-Offline Estimation Coefficient (DOEC).

Result: OE2D demonstrates near-optimal regret with only logarithmic calls to a regression oracle, achieving higher efficiency when the horizon ($T$) is known.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges offline and online oracle-based contextual bandit algorithms, extending the theoretical and practical understanding of low-regret strategies.

Abstract: We propose an algorithmic framework, Offline Estimation to Decisions (OE2D), that reduces contextual bandit learning with general reward function approximation to offline regression. The framework allows near-optimal regret for contextual bandits with large action spaces with $O(log(T))$ calls to an offline regression oracle over $T$ rounds, and makes $O(loglog(T))$ calls when $T$ is known. The design of OE2D algorithm generalizes Falcon~\citep{simchi2022bypassing} and its linear reward version~\citep[][Section 4]{xu2020upper} in that it chooses an action distribution that we term ``exploitative F-design'' that simultaneously guarantees low regret and good coverage that trades off exploration and exploitation. Central to our regret analysis is a new complexity measure, the Decision-Offline Estimation Coefficient (DOEC), which we show is bounded in bounded Eluder dimension per-context and smoothed regret settings. We also establish a relationship between DOEC and Decision Estimation Coefficient (DEC)~\citep{foster2021statistical}, bridging the design principles of offline- and online-oracle efficient contextual bandit algorithms for the first time.

### [196] [Boltzmann Reinforcement Learning for Noise resilience in Analog Ising Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09162)
*Aditya Choudhary,Saaketh Desai,Prasad Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BRAIN, a framework using reinforcement learning to enhance analog Ising machines' (AIMs) resilience to noise and improve optimization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations posed by measurement noise in traditional algorithms used with AIMs and enhance their efficiency in solving Ising problems.

Method: BRAIN employs a variational reinforcement learning approach to approximate the Boltzmann distribution, aggregating information across noisy AIM measurements instead of state-by-state sampling.

Result: BRAIN retains 98% ground state fidelity under 3% noise, greatly outperforming MCMC (51%), with up to 192x faster performance. The method scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.55})$ for large systems and withstands noise levels up to 40%.

Conclusion: BRAIN is a scalable, robust, and noise-resistant optimization and sampling framework, suitable for exploiting AIMs' potential in solving complex combinatorial problems.

Abstract: Analog Ising machines (AIMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for combinatorial optimization, utilizing physical dynamics to solve Ising problems with high energy efficiency. However, the performance of traditional optimization and sampling algorithms on these platforms is often limited by inherent measurement noise. We introduce BRAIN (Boltzmann Reinforcement for Analog Ising Networks), a distribution learning framework that utilizes variational reinforcement learning to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. By shifting from state-by-state sampling to aggregating information across multiple noisy measurements, BRAIN is resilient to Gaussian noise characteristic of AIMs. We evaluate BRAIN across diverse combinatorial topologies, including the Curie-Weiss and 2D nearest-neighbor Ising systems. We find that under realistic 3\% Gaussian measurement noise, BRAIN maintains 98\% ground state fidelity, whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods degrade to 51\% fidelity. Furthermore, BRAIN reaches the MCMC-equivalent solution up to 192x faster under these conditions. BRAIN exhibits $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.55})$ scaling up to 65,536 spins and maintains robustness against severe measurement uncertainty up to 40\%. Beyond ground state optimization, BRAIN accurately captures thermodynamic phase transitions and metastable states, providing a scalable and noise-resilient method for utilizing analog computing architectures in complex optimizations.

*Zahra Kadkhodaie,Aram-Alexandre Pooladian,Sinho Chewi,Eero Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs) which do not use noise amplitude directly, and demonstrates they can sample efficiently and generate higher-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if blind denoising diffusion models can perform effectively even without access to explicit noise amplitude, particularly in the context of data distributions with low intrinsic dimensionality.

Method: They theoretically prove BDDMs' capability to implicitly track noise schedules and test these findings empirically against synthetic and image data.

Result: BDDMs accurately estimate noise variance from noisy data, and outperform conventional diffusion models in terms of sample quality, while addressing residual noise and schedule mismatch issues.

Conclusion: Schedule-free BDDMs, despite the lack of explicit noise schedules, can generate high-quality samples and provide improved results over standard diffusion models by compensating for residual noise mismatches.

Abstract: We analyze, theoretically and empirically, the performance of generative diffusion models based on \emph{blind denoisers}, in which the denoiser is not given the noise amplitude in either the training or sampling processes. Assuming that the data distribution has low intrinsic dimensionality, we prove that blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), despite not having access to the noise amplitude, \emph{automatically} track a particular \emph{implicit} noise schedule along the reverse process. Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts. We provide evidence that this performance gain arises because BDDMs correct the mismatch between the true residual noise (of the image) and the noise assumed by the schedule used in non-blind diffusion models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new algorithm, LIPPAX, to improve convergence rates for stochastic variational inequalities in federated optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between current convergence rates in stochastic variational inequalities and state-of-the-art bounds for federated convex optimization.

Method: Refined analysis of Local Extra SGD algorithm and introducing the new Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX) that mitigates client drift.

Result: LIPPAX achieves better convergence rates in settings like bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance scenarios, and extends results to federated composite variational inequalities.

Conclusion: Proposed improvements and the LIPPAX algorithm advance the current understanding and solution approach for federated optimization of stochastic variational inequalities.

Abstract: In this paper, we study federated optimization for solving stochastic variational inequalities (VIs), a problem that has attracted growing attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress, a significant gap remains between existing convergence rates and the state-of-the-art bounds known for federated convex optimization. In this work, we address this limitation by establishing a series of improved convergence rates. First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings. Finally, we extend our results to federated composite variational inequalities and establish improved convergence guarantees.

*Jonathan Svirsky,Yehonathan Refael,Ofir Lindenbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sparsification method for finetuning large language models, achieving efficient adaptation while reducing parameters without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large language models is computationally expensive, increases memory usage, and risks overfitting. Existing solutions balance these issues but have shortcomings such as increased inference latency.

Method: Develop a sparsification approach using training stochastic gates to selectively adapt rows and columns in language models, minimizing trainable parameters, cutting inference time, and removing 20-40% of parameters.

Result: Outperforms existing finetuning methods in both efficiency and performance, with theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic gating process.

Conclusion: Sparsity proves to be an efficient mechanism for task-specific adaptation in large language models, offering a simpler optimization landscape compared to other approaches.

Abstract: Fully finetuning foundation language models (LMs) with billions of parameters is often impractical due to high computational costs, memory requirements, and the risk of overfitting. Although methods like low-rank adapters help address these challenges by adding small trainable modules to the frozen LM, they also increase memory usage and do not reduce inference latency. We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss. Empirical results show it outperforms recent finetuning baselines in efficiency and performance. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of this stochastic gating process, and show that our method admits a simpler and better-conditioned optimization landscape compared to LoRA. Our results highlight sparsity as a compelling mechanism for task-specific adaptation in LMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To showcase that small, frozen specialized language models (SLMs) can achieve structured reasoning without relying on massive monolithic LLMs.

Method: Introduces 'soft hidden-state collaboration,' integrating frozen SLMs with a trainable attention interface to coordinate latent expert representation.

Result: Competitive performance observed in tasks like Reasoning Gym and GSM8K, revealing emergent specialization and improved expert utilization dynamics.

Conclusion: Hidden-state collaboration offers a compact and effective way to leverage frozen SLMs while providing insights into their utilization patterns during training.

Abstract: Recent progress in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) shows that small, specialized language models (SLMs) can exhibit structured reasoning without relying on large monolithic LLMs. We introduce soft hidden-state collaboration, where multiple heterogeneous frozen SLM experts are integrated through their internal representations via a trainable attention interface. Experiments on Reasoning Gym and GSM8K show that this latent integration is competitive with strong single-model RLVR baselines. Ablations further reveal a dual mechanism of expert utilization: for simpler arithmetic domains, performance gains can largely be explained by static expert preferences, whereas more challenging settings induce increasingly concentrated and structured expert attention over training, indicating emergent specialization in how the router connects to relevant experts. Overall, hidden-state collaboration provides a compact mechanism for leveraging frozen experts, while offering an observational window into expert utilization patterns and their evolution under RLVR.

### [201] [Causal Identification in Multi-Task Demand Learning with Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09969)
*Varun Gupta,Vijay Kamble*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to estimate causal price-response functions in multi-task learning, overcoming challenges with endogenous prices often seen in retail pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retail pricing often involves estimating diverse price-response functions across tasks, despite limited data and endogeneity issues where prices are influenced by unobserved factors.

Method: The authors propose Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), a technique leveraging task heterogeneity while addressing endogeneity in decision histories.

Result: The study shows that DCMOML identifies task-level causal parameters under mild price adaptivity, enabling effective demand estimation even with small-scale per-task data.

Conclusion: DCMOML provides a robust foundation for using causal, data-driven pricing models in retail, enhancing demand prediction under complex multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: We study a canonical multi-task demand learning problem motivated by retail pricing, in which a firm seeks to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across a large collection of decision contexts. Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.
  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework using the Weighted Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes (W2BGP) for exotic Bayesian Optimization tasks such as collaborative/federated BO, batch BO, and multi-fidelity BO. The framework enables computational efficiencies and reinterprets popular BO acquisition functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a common framework using the Weighted Wasserstein Barycenter for addressing different tasks in Bayesian Optimization, unifying diverse methods and improving computational efficiency.

Method: The method involves employing a Weighted Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes, customized with task-specific weighting schemas, enabling the handling of various Bayesian Optimization tasks under a unified framework.

Result: The empirical analysis shows that exotic BO tasks can effectively be addressed with minor adjustments to the weighting schema in W2BGP. The framework also facilitates a more computationally efficient approach to handling Wasserstein Barycenters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the W2BGP framework provides a unified and efficient approach to tackle multiple BO tasks, simplifies the reinterpretation of popular acquisition functions, and opens new research avenues.

Abstract: Exploiting the analogy between Gaussian Distributions and Gaussian Processes' posterior, we present how the weighted Wasserstein Barycenter of Gaussian Processes (W2BGP) can be used to unify, under a common framework, different exotic Bayesian Optimization (BO) tasks. Specifically, collaborative/federated BO, (synchronous) batch BO, and multi-fidelity BO are considered in this paper. Our empirical analysis proves that each one of these tasks requires just an appropriate weighting schema for the W2BGP, while the entire framework remains untouched. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most well-known BO acquisition functions can be easily re-interpreted under the proposed framework and also enable a more computationally efficient way to deal with the computation of the Wasserstein Barycenter, compared with state-of-the-art methods from the Machine Learning literature. Finally, research perspectives branching from the proposed approach are presented.

TL;DR: This paper studies the theoretical foundation of iterative self-improvement in language models, analyzing self-improvement as a maximum-likelihood fine-tuning method with finite-sample guarantees and validating findings experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited theoretical understanding of iterative self-improvement in autoregressive large language models, despite its empirical success.

Method: The authors model self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution, derive finite-sample guarantees, analyze feedback loops, and validate insights through simulations and reasoning experiments.

Result: Findings reveal a feedback loop where better models access more data, sustaining improvement but with eventual saturation. Easy-to-hard task curricula provide better guarantees under controlled conditions.

Conclusion: Iterative self-improvement can be theoretically explained using finite-sample guarantees, demonstrating effectiveness under specific curricula and controlled conditions, supported by simulations and experiments.

Abstract: Iterative self-improvement fine-tunes an autoregressive large language model (LLM) on reward-verified outputs generated by the LLM itself. In contrast to the empirical success of self-improvement, the theoretical foundation of this generative, iterative procedure in a practical, finite-sample setting remains limited. We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks. Our analyses are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations and controlled experiments on graph-based reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a gradient-based residual connection to enhance neural networks' ability to approximate high-frequency functions, demonstrating its utility in regression tasks, image super-resolution, and standard vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve neural networks' performance in approximating high-frequency functions, inspired by insights linking gradient properties to the difficulty of function approximation.

Method: The authors introduce a gradient-based residual connection as an enhancement to standard identity skip connections in residual networks, with theoretical justification and a convex combination for flexible gradient reliance.

Result: In experiments, the gradient residual improves performance in high-frequency function regression and single-image super-resolution while maintaining comparable performance to standard residual networks in tasks like classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: The gradient-based residual connection offers a significant improvement for approximating high-frequency functions and has potential for broad application across various neural network tasks.

Abstract: Existing work has linked properties of a function's gradient to the difficulty of function approximation. Motivated by these insights, we study how gradient information can be leveraged to improve neural network's ability to approximate high-frequency functions, and we propose a gradient-based residual connection as a complement to the standard identity skip connection used in residual networks. We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns. In contrast, our gradient residual substantially improves approximation quality. We then introduce a convex combination of the standard and gradient residuals, allowing the network to flexibly control how strongly it relies on gradient information. After validating the design choices of our proposed method through an ablation study, we further validate our approach's utility on the single-image super-resolution task, where the underlying function may be high-frequency. Finally, on standard tasks such as image classification and segmentation, our method achieves performance comparable to standard residual networks, suggesting its broad utility.

TL;DR: A novel feature interaction module, ML-DCN, improves the efficiency and effectiveness of deep learning recommendation systems within strict serving budgets, outperforming existing methods like DCNv2 and MaskNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a feature interaction module for deep learning recommendation systems that scales efficiently with increased compute while staying within serving constraints like latency and FLOPs.

Method: The paper introduces ML-DCN, which integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling tailored interaction modeling per example for higher efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: ML-DCN achieves higher predictive performance (AUC) compared to DCNv2, MaskNet, and other alternatives, with better scalability in AUC-FLOPs trade-off on a large internal dataset and significant improvements in key ads metrics in online A/B tests.

Conclusion: ML-DCN addresses the limitations of existing models for large-scale ad ranking, offering state-of-the-art performance without compromising serving costs, and has been successfully deployed in production.

Abstract: Deep learning recommendation systems rely on feature interaction modules to model complex user-item relationships across sparse categorical and dense features. In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off. Finally, online A/B tests demonstrate statistically significant improvements in key ads metrics (including CTR and click-quality measures) and ML-DCN has been deployed in the production system with neutral serving cost.

*Tobias Schröder,Lester Mackey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WildCat is a cost-effective attention mechanism that uses a weighted coreset approach to reduce the quadratic resource costs associated with neural network attention, achieving near-linear runtime with strong error guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational expense of attention mechanisms in neural networks, due to its quadratic resource scaling with the input sequence length, motivates the need for an efficient yet accurate compression technique.

Method: WildCat uses a fast, spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm called randomly pivoted Cholesky to create a weighted coreset for attention. This reduces computational costs while ensuring optimal weighting to minimize reconstruction error.

Result: WildCat achieves super-polynomial error decay that approximates exact attention with near-linear runtime. Its GPU-optimized implementation demonstrates strong performance across image generation, image classification, and language model key-value cache compression.

Conclusion: WildCat offers an accurate, low-cost alternative to traditional attention mechanisms with superior runtime efficiency and strong practical benchmarks in various domains.

Abstract: We introduce WildCat, a high-accuracy, low-cost approach to compressing the attention mechanism in neural networks. While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\sqrt{\log(\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression.

*Xiaofeng Xiao,Xiao Hu,Yang Ye,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), enhancing reinforcement learning with causal reasoning to identify action components that drive high rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion policies in reinforcement learning rely on statistical associations and neglect causal relationships, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing rewards.

Method: CausalGDP integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL by learning a causal dynamical model from offline data, updating causal information in real-time, and guiding diffusion toward impactful actions.

Result: Experimental results show CausalGDP performs competitively or better than existing methods, especially for complex control tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating causality into diffusion policies offers a robust approach for improving reinforcement learning, focusing on action components that drive better performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making problems. Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models with large parameters often overfit and produce unstable forecasts in time series domains, necessitating a simpler, robust method for forecasting.

Method: A multi-view approach utilizing single-value embeddings, a scaled time-range input, and embedding dropout mechanisms to enhance forecasting accuracy and interpretability.

Result: Competitive performance with fewer parameters and robust results across datasets, including scenarios with noisy or sparse data.

Conclusion: This lightweight forecasting method offers a robust alternative with enhanced insights into feature contributions, addressing shortcomings of complex models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task across domains such as energy, finance, and meteorology, where accurate predictions enable informed decision-making. While transformer-based and large-parameter models have recently achieved state-of-the-art results, their complexity can lead to overfitting and unstable forecasts, especially when older data points become less relevant. In this paper, we propose a lightweight multi-view approach to short-term load forecasting that leverages single-value embeddings and a scaled time-range input to capture temporally relevant features efficiently. We introduce an embedding dropout mechanism to prevent over-reliance on specific features and enhance interpretability. Our method achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating robustness across multiple datasets, including scenarios with noisy or sparse data, and provides insights into the contributions of individual features to the forecast.

*Shreya Saha,Zoe Wanying He,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a barycentric alignment framework to align neural network representations, enabling detailed similarity comparisons across inputs and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing neural network representations is challenging due to symmetries like reordering or rotations that obscure equivalences.

Method: Barycentric alignment framework is used to construct universal embedding spaces, enabling fine-grained similarity comparisons across models and stimuli.

Result: This method highlights systematic properties affecting representation convergence/divergence, understands brain representation alignment, and mirrors human-aligned cross-modal comparisons.

Conclusion: Instance-level representational similarity offers new insights into model alignment, surpassing traditional set-level metrics.

Abstract: Comparing representations across neural networks is challenging because representations admit symmetries, such as arbitrary reordering of units or rotations of activation space, that obscure underlying equivalence between models. We introduce a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out these nuisance symmetries to construct a universal embedding space across many models. Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison. Together, these results show that resolving representational similarity at the level of individual stimuli reveals phenomena that cannot be detected by set-level comparison metrics.

*Xincan Feng,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors systematically study the role of embedding magnitude in contrastive learning and reveal its importance depending on task symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the ambiguity around whether, when, and how embedding magnitude impacts contrastive learning while improving understanding and leveraging its benefits.

Method: They perform a detailed $2 \times 2$ ablation study, controlling for input and output normalization separately across text and vision models.

Result: Key findings are: output magnitude correlates with relevance in text retrieval, asymmetry in roles of input and output magnitudes, and magnitude's divergent impacts on symmetric versus asymmetric tasks.

Conclusion: Task symmetry (distinct input roles) determines whether cosine or dot product should be chosen, offering cost-free performance improvements by adjusting this selection.

Abstract: Cosine similarity is prevalent in contrastive learning, yet it makes an implicit assumption: embedding magnitude is noise. Prior work occasionally found dot product and cosine similarity comparable, but left unanswered WHAT information magnitude carries, WHEN it helps, and HOW to leverage it. We conduct a systematic study through a $2 \times 2$ ablation that independently controls input-side and output-side normalization across text and vision models. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, in text retrieval, output (document) magnitude strongly correlates with relevance (Cohen's $d$ up to 1.80), yielding the largest gains on reasoning-intensive tasks. Second, input and output magnitudes serve asymmetric roles: output magnitude directly scales similarity scores while input magnitude modulates training dynamics. Third, magnitude learning benefits asymmetric tasks (text retrieval, RAG) but harms symmetric tasks (STS, text-image alignment). These findings establish a task symmetry principle: the choice between cosine and dot product depends on whether the task has distinct input roles, enabling cost-free improvements by simply removing an unnecessary constraint.

Method: Introduces a gradually changing environment simulated using input/output interpolation and task sampling. Conducts both theoretical and empirical analyses to explore the effects of gradual changes.

Result: Finds that the 'loss of plasticity' phenomenon is primarily a consequence of abrupt task changes and can be nearly eliminated in gradually changing environments.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitation of abrupt task change assumptions in existing research and suggests that gradual environmental changes be considered in future continual learning investigations.

Abstract: Continual learning has become a trending topic in machine learning. Recent studies have discovered an interesting phenomenon called loss of plasticity, referring to neural networks gradually losing the ability to learn new tasks. However, existing plasticity research largely relies on contrived settings with abrupt task transitions, which often do not reflect real-world environments. In this paper, we propose to investigate a gradually changing environment, and we simulate this by input/output interpolation and task sampling. We perform theoretical and empirical analysis, showing that the loss of plasticity is an artifact of abrupt tasks changes in the environment and can be largely mitigated if the world changes gradually.

### [212] [RAPID: Risk of Attribute Prediction-Induced Disclosure in Synthetic Microdata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09235)
*Matthias Templ,Oscar Thees,Roman Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAPID, a new measure for disclosure risk in synthetic data, focusing on adversaries' ability to infer sensitive attributes using predictive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic and interpretable disclosure risk measures in synthetic microdata regarding adversarial attribute inference.

Method: A disclosure risk measure, RAPID, is proposed which evaluates inferential vulnerability based on adversarial predictive modeling on synthetic data, quantifying risk for both continuous and categorical sensitive attributes.

Result: The RAPID framework is shown to provide an interpretable and realistic upper bound on attribute-inference disclosure risks using simulations and real data evaluations.

Conclusion: RAPID is a practical and robust way to complement existing synthetic data utility and disclosure frameworks by quantifying adversarial disclosure risks.

Abstract: Statistical data anonymization increasingly relies on fully synthetic microdata, for which classical identity disclosure measures are less informative than an adversary's ability to infer sensitive attributes from released data. We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data. Our results show that RAPID provides a practical, attacker-realistic upper bound on attribute-inference disclosure risk that complements existing utility diagnostics and disclosure control frameworks.

### [213] [Feature salience -- not task-informativeness -- drives machine learning model explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09238)
*Benedict Clark,Marta Oliveira,Rick Wilming,Stefan Haufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper questions whether importance attribution in Explainable AI (XAI) actually reflects relevant information or is influenced by other factors like feature salience. Their experiments show that feature attribution is mainly driven by visual salience rather than learned statistical associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether feature importance in XAI methods accurately identifies informative elements about the target variable or if it is influenced by other factors such as visual salience, novelty, or statistical suppression.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using deep learning models trained on three variations of a binary image classification task with watermark features acting as class-dependent confounds, class-independent noise, or being absent. They evaluated importance attribution using five XAI methods.

Result: Their findings reveal that relative importance in watermarked areas is primarily determined by visual salience rather than the learned associations. Statistical dependence, such as class-dependency of watermarks, had minimal influence.

Conclusion: The study concludes that XAI feature attribution methods may reflect unintended biases towards visually salient features, raising concerns about their real-world reliability. Successful XAI applications should be reassessed, especially for the reliance on salience over informativeness.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) promises to provide insight into machine learning models' decision processes, where one goal is to identify failures such as shortcut learning. This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.

*Xiaoguang Guo,Zehong Wang,Jiazheng Li,Shawn Spitzel,Qi Yang,Kaize Ding,Jundong Li,Chuxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses stability and performance challenges of deployed graph neural networks under distribution shifts and perturbations. It proposes STEM-GNN, a framework achieving stronger robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployed graph neural networks often struggle with clean, shifted, and perturbed data due to static inference methods. The paper aims to resolve the trade-offs between generalization, stability, and worst-case performance by rethinking how GNN structures process data.

Method: The authors introduce STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework. It includes a mixture-of-experts encoder, vector-quantized token interface for signal stabilization, and a Lipschitz-regularized head for output control.

Result: Across nine benchmarks on various graph tasks, STEM-GNN enhances robustness under degree/homophily shifts and feature/edge corruptions while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.

Conclusion: Instance-conditional routing can address the inherent trade-offs in static inference. STEM-GNN successfully balances stability, generalization under shifts, and robustness to perturbations, providing a promising solution in diverse graph-related challenges.

Abstract: Deployed graph neural networks (GNNs) are frozen at deployment yet must fit clean data, generalize under distribution shifts, and remain stable to perturbations. We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.

### [215] [The effect of whitening on explanation performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09278)
*Benedict Clark,Stoyan Karastoyanov,Rick Wilming,Stefan Haufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines the capacity of data whitening to address deficiencies in feature attribution methods by reducing errors caused by statistical suppression, evaluating its effectiveness across various XAI methods and model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the critical challenge in XAI—feature attribution methods often produce unreliable explanations by assigning undue importance to non-informative variables (e.g., suppressor variables).

Method: The study evaluates 16 feature attribution methods with 5 whitening transformations using the XAI-TRIS benchmark and theoretical analysis of a two-dimensional classification problem to assess the impact of whitening.

Result: Findings show partial improvements in explanation performance with some whitening techniques, though the outcomes depend heavily on the XAI method and model architecture, revealing varied effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of preprocessing techniques, like whitening, to improve explanation reliability but highlights its inconsistent impact across different methods and models.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide transparent insights into machine learning models, yet the reliability of many feature attribution methods remains a critical challenge. Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures. These findings highlight the complex relationship between data non-linearities, preprocessing quality, and attribution fidelity, underscoring the vital role of pre-processing techniques in enhancing model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate privacy-utility tradeoffs in synthetic data generation, addressing challenges posed by financial datasets, such as regulatory risks and class imbalances.

Method: The study evaluates autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, and copula synthesizers, implementing new privacy-preserving GAN and autoencoder methods, and comparing their performance on balanced and imbalanced datasets.

Result: The results highlight the difficulties of generating high-quality synthetic data while balancing privacy and utility, especially in contexts of mixed-type attributes and extreme class imbalances.

Conclusion: The work provides insights and contributes to understanding the challenges in privacy-preserving synthetic data generation for complex financial datasets.

Abstract: We explore the privacy-utility tradeoff of synthetic data generation schemes on tabular financial datasets, a domain characterized by high regulatory risk and severe class imbalance. We consider representative tabular data generators, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion, and copula synthesizers. To address the challenges of the financial domain, we provide novel privacy-preserving implementations of GAN and autoencoder synthesizers. We evaluate whether and how well the generators simultaneously achieve data quality, downstream utility, and privacy, with comparison across balanced and imbalanced input datasets. Our results offer insight into the distinct challenges of generating synthetic data from datasets that exhibit severe class imbalance and mixed-type attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKW) and other marine mammals by creating the largest curated acoustic dataset for conservation and research purposes.

Method: A weakly-supervised, positive-unlabelled active learning strategy is employed to search over 30 years of archival hydrophone data, leveraging transformer-based species and ecotype classifiers with state-of-the-art performance.

Result: The study achieved high detection accuracy (specificity of 0-28.8% at 95% sensitivity) and curated a broad dataset with over 919 hours of SRKW data and substantial recordings of other marine mammals, surpassing existing datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset enhances SRKW research and conservation applications and is publicly available to enable further habitat studies, unsupervised machine translation, and species usage analysis.

Abstract: This work presents the largest curation of Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) acoustic data to date, also containing other marine mammals in their environment. We systematically search all available public archival hydrophone data within the SRKW habitat (over 30 years of audio data). The search consists of a weakly-supervised, positive-unlabelled, active learning strategy to identify all instances of marine mammals. The resulting transformer-based detectors outperform state-of-the-art detectors on the DEEPAL, DCLDE-2026, and two newly introduced expert-annotated datasets in terms of accuracy, energy efficiency, and speed. The detection model has a specificity of 0-28.8% at 95% sensitivity. Our multiclass species classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 42.1% (11 train classes, 4 test classes) and our ecotype classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 43.0% (4 train classes, 5 test classes) on the DCLDE-2026 dataset.
  We yield 919 hours of SRKW data, 230 hours of Bigg's orca data, 1374 hours of orca data from unlabelled ecotypes, 1501 hours of humpback data, 88 hours of sea lion data, 246 hours of pacific white-sided dolphin data, and over 784 hours of unspecified marine mammal data. This SRKW dataset is larger than DCLDE-2026, Ocean Networks Canada, and OrcaSound combined. The curated species labels are available under CC-BY 4.0 license, and the corresponding audio data are available under the licenses of the original owners. The comprehensive nature of this dataset makes it suitable for unsupervised machine translation, habitat usage surveys, and conservation endeavours for this critically endangered ecotype.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Laplacian mechanism within transformers' attention to better control token variance, boosting performance across benchmarks and improving token representation geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transformers by directly controlling token variance and achieving an ideal token geometry for better token separability.

Method: Introduce a Laplacian mechanism into transformers' attention layers, analyzing its impact using PCA, cosine similarity, variance analysis, and Neural Collapse metrics.

Result: Consistent improvements observed across computer vision and language benchmarks, with token representations reshaped for maximal separability and Neural Collapse of class means.

Conclusion: The Laplacian mechanism improves token variance control and enhances token representation geometry, benefiting class separability in transformers.

Abstract: Transformers leverage attention, the residual connection, and layer normalization to control the variance of token representations. We propose to modify attention into a Laplacian mechanism that gives the model more direct control over token variance. We conjecture that this helps transformers achieve the ideal token geometry. To investigate our conjecture, we first show that incorporating the Laplacian mechanism into transformers induces consistent improvements across benchmarks in computer vision and language. Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces algorithms for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, focusing on policy gradient methods for three types of risk measures. It provides theoretical guarantees and experimental validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of sufficient algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL) sensitive to specific risk measures, offering a way to manage uncertainties better.

Method: The authors derive policy gradient theorems for three risk measures, propose corresponding estimators with bounded errors, prove the smoothness of their objectives, and give convergence guarantees.

Result: They achieve $O(1/m)$ mean-squared error bounds for their policy gradient estimators, provide convergence rates for their algorithms, and validate their approach through experiments on RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed risk-sensitive algorithms are theoretically supported and experimentally validated, making them viable for use in risk-aware RL scenarios.

Abstract: We propose risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithms catering to three families of risk measures, namely expectiles, utility-based shortfall risk and optimized certainty equivalent risk. For each risk measure, in the context of a finite horizon Markov decision process, we first derive a policy gradient theorem. Second, we propose estimators of the risk-sensitive policy gradient for each of the aforementioned risk measures, and establish $\mathcal{O}\left(1/m\right)$ mean-squared error bounds for our estimators, where $m$ is the number of trajectories. Further, under standard assumptions for policy gradient-type algorithms, we establish smoothness of the risk-sensitive objective, in turn leading to stationary convergence rate bounds for the overall risk-sensitive policy gradient algorithm that we propose. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings on popular RL benchmarks.

*Che-Chia Chang,Chen-Yang Dai,Te-Sheng Lin,Ming-Chih Lai,Chieh-Hsin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving PDEs, addressing stability issues by proposing a two-stage training strategy and a two-step residual objective, enabling efficient and high-fidelity inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of solving PDEs efficiently via generative inference while overcoming stability issues caused by physics-constrained consistency training.

Method: They propose a two-stage training strategy where distribution learning is decoupled from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during fine-tuning, alongside a two-step residual objective to improve physical consistency.

Result: The proposed framework achieves stable and accurate generative inference for PDE solutions, with significant computational efficiency over diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: The approach provides a computationally efficient method for solving PDEs with high accuracy, leveraging stability improvements in generative models.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed consistency modeling framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) via fast, few-step generative inference. We identify a key stability challenge in physics-constrained consistency training, where PDE residuals can drive the model toward trivial or degenerate solutions, degrading the learned data distribution. To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.

*Mohammad Partohaghighi,Roummel Marcia,Bruce J. West,YangQuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a method that facilitates machine unlearning by reallocating updates based on layer stability, aiming to improve stability for large or adversarial unlearning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of retaining model utility while removing the influence of a specific forget set, particularly in scenarios involving brittle or adversarial deletions due to heterogeneous layer characteristics in deep networks.

Method: The SRAGU method involves reallocating unlearning updates based on layer-wise spectral stability, determined using heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics. This mechanism dampens updates to unstable layers and concentrates motion in spectrally stable ones, improving stability.

Result: The proposed SRAGU method ensures better behavioral alignment with gold retrained models and reduces prediction divergence and leakage signals under tough unlearning conditions.

Conclusion: By reallocating unlearning motion to more stable regions of the network, SRAGU achieves more reliable unlearning results, particularly in scenarios of adversarial deletions or unstable layers, outperforming naive approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of a designated forget set from a trained model while preserving utility on the retained data. In modern deep networks, approximate unlearning frequently fails under large or adversarial deletions due to pronounced layer-wise heterogeneity: some layers exhibit stable, well-regularized representations while others are brittle, undertrained, or overfit, so naive update allocation can trigger catastrophic forgetting or unstable dynamics. We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL) to address core challenges in reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on the central role of reward modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reasoning consistency and reliability of LLMs by addressing the underexplored relationship between reward modeling and fundamental challenges such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning.

Method: The authors propose the RARL framework, present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking, and evaluate existing benchmarks to address vulnerabilities and improve evaluation approaches.

Result: The paper identifies critical gaps in reward modeling for reasoning tasks, unifies diverse reward paradigms, and highlights connections between reward design and key LLM challenges.

Conclusion: This work establishes reward modeling as a crucial factor in LLM reasoning alignment, offering a roadmap for developing robust, verifiable, and trustworthy reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate transformative potential, yet their reasoning remains inconsistent and unreliable. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation. By integrating fragmented research threads and clarifying the interplay between reward design and fundamental reasoning capabilities, this work provides a foundational roadmap for building reasoning models that are robust, verifiable, and trustworthy.

*Thi Minh Chau Nguyen,Minh Hieu Nguyen,Duc Anh Nguyen,Xuan Huong Tran,Thanh Trung Huynh,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a federated sequential recommendation framework called LUMOS, leveraging large language models for local semantic generation to improve recommendation quality while preserving user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated sequential recommendation systems struggle with fragmented and noisy user data, limited semantic diversity, and increased system overhead from server-side constraints.

Method: LUMOS employs large language models locally to generate three types of sequence variants: future-oriented, semantically rephrased, and counterfactual sequences. These sequences are encoded with a tri-view contrastive optimization strategy within a federated system.

Result: LUMOS outperforms existing centralized and federated methods on HR@20 and NDCG@20 metrics across multiple benchmarks. It is robust under noisy and adversarial conditions while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: LUMOS highlights the potential of utilizing large language models for local semantic generation to advance privacy-focused federated recommendation systems efficiently.

Abstract: Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) aims to perform next-item prediction while keeping user data decentralised, yet model quality is frequently constrained by fragmented, noisy, and homogeneous interaction logs stored on individual devices. Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven semantic generation as a new paradigm for advancing privacy-preserving federated recommendation.

*Zhendong Mi,Yixiao Chen,Pu Zhao,Xiaodong Yu,Hao Wang,Yanzhi Wang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RFID-MoE, a method for compressing Mixture-of-Experts-based Large Language Models using heterogeneous metrics for rank allocation and sparse projection to minimize information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high memory overhead of storing MoE networks, while improving compression techniques beyond uniform rank allocation and static weight properties.

Method: The method adapts rank allocation based on Routing Frequency and Information Density metrics and reconstructs residuals through sparse projection, allowing effective compression with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: RFID-MoE outperformed state-of-the-art compression methods, achieving significant improvements in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across various models and tasks.

Conclusion: RFID-MoE enhances compression methods for MoE models while reducing computational costs, ensuring practical deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance, yet the massive memory overhead caused by storing multiple expert networks severely hinders their practical deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.

### [225] [Priority-Aware Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09326)
*Kiljae Lee,Ziqi Liu,Weijing Tang,Yuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PASV (Priority-Aware Shapley Value), extending traditional Shapley values to account for dependencies and priority weights among contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values assume interchangeable contributors, which becomes problematic in situations where contributors are dependent (e.g., reused data, causal orders) or when contributions involve trust, risk, or other priority factors.

Method: The authors propose PASV, integrating precedence constraints and priority weights into Shapley values, along with an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for its estimation. They further analyze extreme priority weights and design practical sensitivity analysis via 'priority sweeping'.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and Census Income datasets show that PASV can produce more structure-faithful allocations and enable effective sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: PASV extends Shapley values to handle dependencies and priorities among contributors, retaining flexibility for various applications while being efficiently computed through new sampling methods.

Abstract: Shapley values are widely used for model-agnostic data valuation and feature attribution, yet they implicitly assume contributors are interchangeable. This can be problematic when contributors are dependent (e.g., reused/augmented data or causal feature orderings) or when contributions should be adjusted by factors such as trust or risk. We propose Priority-Aware Shapley Value (PASV), which incorporates both hard precedence constraints and soft, contributor-specific priority weights. PASV is applicable to general precedence structures, recovers precedence-only and weight-only Shapley variants as special cases, and is uniquely characterized by natural axioms. We develop an efficient adjacent-swap Metropolis-Hastings sampler for scalable Monte Carlo estimation and analyze limiting regimes induced by extreme priority weights. Experiments on data valuation (MNIST/CIFAR10) and feature attribution (Census Income) demonstrate more structure-faithful allocations and a practical sensitivity analysis via our proposed "priority sweeping".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of pre-hospital physiological data that limits early stroke prediction and to validate the predictive value of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals before stroke onset.

Method: The study used LLM-assisted data mining to extract precise stroke onset times, validated by physicians, from MIMIC-III and MC-MED datasets. It analyzed pre-stroke PPG data and employed a ResNet-1D model to predict stroke at early-warning horizons.

Result: Using pre-onset PPG data, the ResNet-1D model achieved high F1-scores (up to 0.9406 and 0.9888) for stroke prediction at 4 to 6 hours before onset across two datasets (MIMIC-III and MC-MED).

Conclusion: The findings confirm that PPG signals carry predictive characteristics for stroke hours before its onset, indicating a significant shift towards proactive stroke surveillance that could improve outcomes in clinical practice.

Abstract: The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.

*Xueying Ding,Simon Klüttermann,Haomin Wen,Yilong Chen,Leman Akoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for outlier detection (OD) on tabular data, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks like AdBench by offering 2,446 datasets categorized into three components: OddBench, OvrBench, and SynBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing outlier detection benchmarks, particularly the small scale and lack of diversity, which hinder the ability to fairly evaluate OD methods and track progress.

Method: The authors present MacrOData, which consists of 2,446 datasets divided into three categories: OddBench (790 datasets for real-world semantic anomalies), OvrBench (856 datasets for statistical outliers), and SynBench (800 synthetic datasets). They provide standardized train/test splits, public/private partitions, semantic metadata annotations, and an online leaderboard.

Result: Extensive experiments were conducted using classical, deep, and foundation-based OD methods. They analyzed diverse hyperparameter configurations, unveiling comprehensive empirical findings and practical guidelines for researchers.

Conclusion: MacrOData offers a substantial improvement over existing benchmarks, enabling robust evaluations of tabular OD methods. The benchmarks, along with detailed findings and leaderboards, are open-sourced to promote future research and advancements in the field.

Abstract: Quality benchmarks are essential for fairly and accurately tracking scientific progress and enabling practitioners to make informed methodological choices. Outlier detection (OD) on tabular data underpins numerous real-world applications, yet existing OD benchmarks remain limited. The prominent OD benchmark AdBench is the de facto standard in the literature, yet comprises only 57 datasets. In addition to other shortcomings discussed in this work, its small scale severely restricts diversity and statistical power. We introduce MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular OD comprising three carefully curated components: OddBench, with 790 datasets containing real-world semantic anomalies; OvrBench, with 856 datasets featuring real-world statistical outliers; and SynBench, with 800 synthetically generated datasets spanning diverse data priors and outlier archetypes. Owing to its scale and diversity, MacrOData enables comprehensive and statistically robust evaluation of tabular OD methods. Our benchmarks further satisfy several key desiderata: We provide standardized train/test splits for all datasets, public/private benchmark partitions with held-out test labels for the latter reserved toward an online leaderboard, and annotate our datasets with semantic metadata. We conduct extensive experiments across all benchmarks, evaluating a broad range of OD methods comprising classical, deep, and foundation models, over diverse hyperparameter configurations. We report detailed empirical findings, practical guidelines, as well as individual performances as references for future research. All benchmarks containing 2,446 datasets combined are open-sourced, along with a publicly accessible leaderboard hosted at https://huggingface.co/MacrOData-CMU.

### [228] [Large Language Models for Designing Participatory Budgeting Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09349)
*Nguyen Thach,Xingchen Sha,Hau Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMRule, a framework that uses large language models in an evolutionary search procedure to design participatory budgeting (PB) rules, improving utility and preserving fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Participatory budgeting requires rules that balance utility and fairness based on residents' preferences, but designing such rules has been challenging due to domain expertise requirements and the trade-off between fairness and utility.

Method: The authors propose LLMRule, which integrates large language models (LLMs) into an evolutionary search approach for automating the creation of PB rules.

Result: Experimental results on over 600 real-world PB instances from various countries show LLMRule-generated rules outperforming handcrafted ones in utility while maintaining fairness.

Conclusion: LLMRule offers an effective automated approach for designing PB rules, harnessing the capabilities of LLMs to address the challenge of optimizing utility and fairness.

Abstract: Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic paradigm for deciding the funding of public projects given the residents' preferences, which has been adopted in numerous cities across the world. The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.

TL;DR: LaPha is a novel method for training AlphaZero-like language model agents using Poincaré latent spaces to optimize performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies in search and scaling in mathematical reasoning tasks performed by LLMs, utilizing the unique properties of the hyperbolic latent space.

Method: LaPha uses a tree-based structure growing in Poincaré space to visualize the search process, employs hyperbolic geodesic distances for correctness-based node potential, and assigns dense rewards. It also incorporates a lightweight value head for enhanced self-guided search with minimal computational burden.

Result: LaPha significantly boosts the performance of Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B on MATH-500 from 66.0% to 88.2%. It achieves record accuracies of 56.7% (AIME'24 with LaPha-1.5B), 60.0% (AIME'24 with LaPha-7B), and 53.3% (AIME'25 with LaPha-7B).

Conclusion: LaPha demonstrates that leveraging Poincaré latent space and value-head-guided search may offer a scalable and efficient framework for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: We propose LaPha, a method for training AlphaZero-like LLM agents in a Poincaré latent space. Under LaPha, the search process can be visualized as a tree rooted at the prompt and growing outward from the origin toward the boundary of the Poincaré ball, where negative curvature provides exponentially increasing capacity with radius. Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences. We further attach a lightweight value head on the same shared latent space, enabling self-guided test-time scaling with almost no additional overhead. On MATH-500, LaPha improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2%. With value-head-guided search, LaPha-1.5B reaches 56.7% accuracy on AIME'24, and LaPha-7B further achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25.

*Yifei Cheng,Xianglin Yang,Guoxia Wang,Chao Huang,Fei Ma,Dianhai Yu,Xiaochun Cao,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SL-SAM is a method to optimize computational efficiency during sharpness-aware minimization by using sparse techniques and dynamic layer selection, reducing active parameters significantly while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extra computation cost introduced by the parameter perturbation step in SAM hinders its practical use, especially during fine-tuning tasks.

Method: SL-SAM uses sparse techniques to dynamically select layers based on gradient norms, framing this selection as a multi-armed bandit problem to reduce computational complexity in both the perturbation and update steps.

Result: SL-SAM achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in fine-tuning tasks, ranks #1 in a large language model (LLM) fine-tuning benchmark, and significantly reduces active parameters during backpropagation.

Conclusion: SL-SAM addresses the efficiency bottleneck in SAM, offering a computationally efficient solution without compromising performance, confirmed by theoretical convergence analysis and experimental validation.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) seeks the minima with a flat loss landscape to improve the generalization performance in machine learning tasks, including fine-tuning. However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\%, 22\% and 21\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

*Nilaksh,Antoine Clavaud,Mathieu Reymond,François Rivest,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an extension to Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) for streaming RL to improve sample efficiency despite transient data issues, and innovates with orthogonal gradient updates to solve training instabilities. Their approach outperforms existing baselines and improves representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of streaming RL agents when learning meaningful representations from transient data, as they discard transitions after single updates leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: They extend Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to streaming RL while introducing orthogonal gradient updates to resolve training instabilities caused by high correlation in streaming samples.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks (Atari, MinAtar, Octax), their approach outperforms existing streaming RL baselines by learning richer representations and bridging the gap caused by the lack of replay buffers.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances sample efficiency in streaming RL, learning better latent representations with a computationally light approach suitable for on-device applications.

Abstract: In streaming Reinforcement Learning (RL), transitions are observed and discarded immediately after a single update. While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores.

TL;DR: The paper investigates an online learning problem involving multiple valid outputs, particularly relevant for language generation tasks, explores three feedback models, and defines mistake and regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge in tasks like language generation where prompts can have multiple valid outputs, but each output isn't necessarily valid.

Method: Study the problem under three feedback models, characterize mistake bounds in a realizable setting, and analyze regret bounds in an agnostic setting.

Result: Provided optimal mistake and regret bounds for three feedback models and implied sample complexity bounds for batched setups based on combinatorial dimensions.

Conclusion: Establishes key theoretical results for modeling and analyzing tasks with multiple valid outputs using combinatorial dimensions.

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with multiple correct answers, where each instance admits a set of valid labels, and in each round the learner must output a valid label for the queried example. This setting is motivated by language generation tasks, in which a prompt may admit many acceptable completions, but not every completion is acceptable. We study this problem under three feedback models. For each model, we characterize the optimal mistake bound in the realizable setting using an appropriate combinatorial dimension. We then establish a trichotomy of regret bounds across the three models in the agnostic setting. Our results also imply sample complexity bounds for the batch setup that depend on the respective combinatorial dimensions.

*Prin Phunyaphibarn,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler to enhance reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models used in generative tasks in chemistry and biology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reward-based guidance in discrete diffusion models struggle with noisy intermediate rewards, limiting performance in scientific domains.

Method: The CSMC Sampler creates a Markov chain of clean samples using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, ensuring that the stationary distribution targets high-reward samples. A tractable proposal distribution is designed through sequential application of diffusion processes.

Result: Experimental results show that CSMC significantly outperforms prior methods on molecule and biological sequence generation tasks across various reward functions.

Conclusion: CSMC offers an effective solution to reward-guided sampling, bypassing the need for noisy intermediate rewards and boosting performance in generative modeling for scientific data.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models for chemistry and biology data. In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution. We design a proposal distribution by sequentially applying the forward and backward diffusion processes, making the acceptance probability tractable. Experiments on molecule and biological sequence generation with various reward functions demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches that rely on intermediate rewards.

*Xinxu Wei,Rong Zhou,Lifang He,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion-based pretraining framework for brain signal foundation models to address augmentation and structural limitations in graph-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transferable representation learning for brain data by overcoming limitations in augmentation methods and structural capture in graph-based approaches.

Method: Developed a diffusion-based framework for structure-aware data augmentation and global structural information capture in brain graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments on neuroimaging datasets with diverse subjects and scans show consistent improvements in performance.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based framework effectively enhances pretraining for brain signal foundation models, preserving semantic connectivity and enabling robust representation learning.

Abstract: With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

*Lihao Mai,Chenhan Xiao,Yang Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using advanced machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and graph neural networks, to efficiently assess and generate critical $N\!-\!k$ contingency scenarios in power systems without exhaustive computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges in assessing high-order $N\!\!\-\!\!k$ contingencies in power systems, which are crucial due to the increasing complexity of modern grids with inverter-based resources and flexible loads.

Method: A conditional diffusion model and a topology-aware graph neural network are employed to generate and evaluate high-impact contingencies tailored to the operating state while ensuring coverage guarantees for critical scenarios.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves identification of high-severity contingencies compared to uniform sampling, using fewer computational resources, as demonstrated on IEEE benchmark systems.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable and risk-managed solution for $N\!\!\-\!\!k$ contingency assessment, consistently identifying critical outages more reliably and efficiently.

Abstract: Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\!-\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\!-\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\!-\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.

*Ofir Schlisselberg,Tal Lancewicki,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores reinforcement learning in a setting where a limited number of steps in an episode of an MDP behave adversarially, and provides algorithms with regret guarantees and extensions to fully adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address scenarios in reinforcement learning where most environment dynamics are stable, but a few steps exhibit adversarial behavior, which could be important for handling unstable or vulnerable points.

Method: The authors introduce 'conditioned occupancy measures', algorithms with regret bounds for both general and consecutive adversarial step settings, and a regret reduction for identifying adversarial steps. They also provide upper and lower bounds for the fully adversarial setting.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(H S^Λ\sqrt{K S A^{Λ+1}})$ and $\tilde{O}(H\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{Λ+1}})$ for general and consecutive adversarial behaviors, respectively. Moreover, they strengthen existing bounds in fully adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper introduces effective algorithms and theoretical bounds for handling adversarial transitions in MDPs, extending understanding of regret performance in both specific and worst-case (fully adversarial) settings.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning in MDPs whose transition function is stochastic at most steps but may behave adversarially at a fixed subset of $Λ$ steps per episode. This model captures environments that are stable except at a few vulnerable points. We introduce \emph{conditioned occupancy measures}, which remain stable across episodes even with adversarial transitions, and use them to design two algorithms. The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\tilde{O}(H S^Λ\sqrt{K S A^{Λ+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon. The second, assuming the adversarial steps are consecutive, improves the dependence on $S$ to $\tilde{O}(H\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{Λ+1}})$. We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $Λ$ adversarial steps. We also characterize the regret of adversarial MDPs in the \emph{fully adversarial} setting ($Λ=H-1$) both for full-information and bandit feedback, and provide almost matching upper and lower bounds (slightly strengthen existing lower bounds, and clarify how different feedback structures affect the hardness of learning).

### [237] [Adaptive recurrent flow map operator learning for reaction diffusion dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09487)
*Huseyin Tunc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a purely data-driven operator-learning framework, DDOL-ART, which achieves stable and robust long-term forecasting for reaction-diffusion systems without using physics-based numerical losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural-operator surrogates struggle with error accumulation in long-term rollouts and inaccuracies with out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions. Physics-based numerical-residual approaches, while stabilizing, add computational and design complexities.

Method: The authors introduce DDOL-ART, a data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training. This approach uses validation-based adaptive milestones to exit ineffective segments and focuses on one-step operator learning trained on short horizons.

Result: DDOL-ART demonstrates strong stability and generalization to OOD conditions across FitzHugh-Nagumo, Gray-Scott, and Lambda-Omega systems. It is faster and offers competitive stability compared to physics-based numerical-loss operator learners.

Conclusion: The feedback-controlled recurrent training strategy enhances robustness and reduces optimization errors, achieving competitive performance with significantly lower training costs compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA variants exhibit inconsistent performance due to overlooked batch size tuning; proper optimization reconciles discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistencies in performance of LoRA variants and improve reliability in fine-tuning evaluations.

Method: Analyze LoRA fine-tuning approaches, systematically tuning batch size, and propose cost-efficient proxy-based tuning strategies.

Result: Found batch size significantly impacts LoRA performance, aligning vanilla LoRA with complex variants under proper tuning.

Conclusion: Batch size optimization is critical for reliable and efficient fine-tuning in LoRA, resolving inconsistencies and improving evaluations.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models, yet its many variants report conflicting empirical gains, often on the same benchmarks. We show that these contradictions arise from a single overlooked factor: the batch size. When properly tuned, vanilla LoRA often matches the performance of more complex variants. We further propose a proxy-based, cost-efficient strategy for batch size tuning, revealing the impact of rank, dataset size, and model capacity on the optimal batch size. Our findings elevate batch size from a minor implementation detail to a first-order design parameter, reconciling prior inconsistencies and enabling more reliable evaluations of LoRA variants.

*Moshe Noivirt,Jessica Sorrell,Eliad Tsfadia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between replicable learning, differential privacy, and statistical query (SQ) learning. It presents the first computationally efficient replicable learning algorithm for parities over any distribution, demonstrating its advantage over SQ-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the computational power of replicable learning, particularly how it compares to differential privacy and the SQ model.

Method: The authors developed a computationally efficient replicable algorithm for learning parities over arbitrary distributions. They introduced a new algorithm for finding subspaces to aid in this task.

Result: The paper shows that replicable learning, computationally, can surpass SQ-learning for general distributions while being close to the power of differentially private learning.

Conclusion: Efficient replicable learning extends beyond SQ-learning but is computationally closer to differentially private learning, suggesting significant implications for learning theory.

Abstract: We study the computational relationship between replicability (Impagliazzo et al. [STOC `22], Ghazi et al. [NeurIPS `21]) and other stability notions. Specifically, we focus on replicable PAC learning and its connections to differential privacy (Dwork et al. [TCC 2006]) and to the statistical query (SQ) model (Kearns [JACM `98]). Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.
  Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy. Our main building block is a new, efficient, and replicable algorithm that, given a set of vectors, outputs a subspace of their linear span that covers most of them.

*Yuanyu Wan,Yu Shen,Dingzhi Yu,Bo Xue,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve decentralized online continuous submodular maximization (D-OCSM) by addressing issues in regret bounds and achieving results comparable to centralized settings, using reductions to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in D-OCSM include large gaps in approximate regret bounds, and inefficient handling of complex decision sets using projection-free algorithms, which cannot recover centralized results. This limits its broader applicability.

Method: The authors propose reductions from D-OCSM to D-OCO, enabling the use of D-OCO algorithms to improve approximate regret bounds in both general convex and downward-closed decision sets.

Result: The proposed techniques successfully address both regret-related issues in D-OCSM, achieving better performance in decentralized settings and narrowing the gap between decentralized and centralized results.

Conclusion: By leveraging reductions to D-OCO, this work advances the field of D-OCSM, offering improved regret bounds and practical algorithms for handling complex decision sets in decentralized online learning.

Abstract: To expand the applicability of decentralized online learning, previous studies have proposed several algorithms for decentralized online continuous submodular maximization (D-OCSM) -- a non-convex/non-concave setting with continuous DR-submodular reward functions. However, there exist large gaps between their approximate regret bounds and the regret bounds achieved in the convex setting. Moreover, if focusing on projection-free algorithms, which can efficiently handle complex decision sets, they cannot even recover the approximate regret bounds achieved in the centralized setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for D-OCSM over general convex decision sets, these two issues can be addressed simultaneously. Furthermore, for D-OCSM over downward-closed decision sets, we show that the second issue can be addressed while significantly alleviating the first issue. Our key techniques are two reductions from D-OCSM to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), which can exploit D-OCO algorithms to improve the approximate regret of D-OCSM in these two cases, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method addressing conflicts in multimodal representation learning, offering a conflict-free approach that improves alignment and reduces gaps across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve inherent conflicts in InfoNCE-based multimodal representation learning objectives, which hinder the semantic alignment of diverse modalities, particularly as the number of modalities increases.

Method: They propose decoupling alignment and uniformity in multimodal representations, forming a method that avoids conflicts and supports generative and discriminative tasks without task-specific modules. Theoretical guarantees link their method to a global Hölder divergence, reducing distribution gaps.

Result: The method shows consistent improvements in experiments on retrieval tasks and UnCLIP-style generation, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupling approach effectively mitigates conflicts in multimodal representation learning, achieving semantic alignment across modalities and enhancing performance for both discriminative and generative use cases.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning aims to construct a shared embedding space in which heterogeneous modalities are semantically aligned. Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that uses low-rank decomposition to improve model compression while preserving performance, outperforming traditional student networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the capacity gap in student networks caused by knowledge distillation and explore how to maximize a student's inheritance of teacher network knowledge.

Method: The approach involves asymmetric low-rank decomposition of the teacher network’s weights using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization, creating lightweight, expressive models while maintaining structural integrity.

Result: InherNet outperforms traditional student networks in various unimodal and multimodal tasks with similar parameter sizes.

Conclusion: InherNet offers a new direction for efficient model compression, showing superior performance and potential beyond traditional KD methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling lightweight student networks to benefit from the performance of redundant teacher networks. However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSpec is a neural network framework that designs iterative spectral algorithms to enhance numerical linear algebra tasks on large-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in large-scale numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization by discovering efficient spectral algorithms tailored to specific tasks.

Method: AutoSpec uses a neural network trained on small synthetic problems to learn recurrence coefficients, predicting task-specific matrix polynomials. It relies on coarse spectral information and designs task-defined objectives to generalize to real-world problems.

Result: Numerical tests demonstrate significant improvements, such as better accuracy and fewer iterations when applied to real-world matrices. The learned procedures align with classical Chebyshev polynomial theory.

Conclusion: AutoSpec effectively learns task-specific iterative algorithms, showing both practical performance gains and alignment with established mathematical principles.

Abstract: We introduce AutoSpec, a neural network framework for discovering iterative spectral algorithms for large-scale numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization. Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ECG-IMN, a new interpretable neural network model for ECG classification that achieves high accuracy while maintaining transparency in decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of interpretability in deep learning models for ECG diagnosis, as existing methods are unstable, costly, and unfaithful to the decision-making process.

Method: The proposed ECG-IMN model uses a hypernetwork approach, where a convolutional backbone generates linear model parameters for each input, ensuring intrinsic interpretability and high-resolution feature attribution.

Result: On the PTB-XL dataset, the proposed method achieves predictive performance comparable to black-box models and provides faithful, instance-specific explanations for predictions.

Conclusion: ECG-IMN successfully combines accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for reliable and trustworthy clinical applications in cardiac diagnostics.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the "black-box" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward "white-box" cardiac diagnostics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Physical Information Bottleneck (PIB), a novel framework for training deep physical neural networks (PNNs) efficiently and universally using information theory and local learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the energy and latency limitations of deep learning by leveraging the inherent energy efficiency and speed of deep physical neural networks (PNNs). However, a universal training method tailored to the physical dynamics of PNNs is needed.

Method: The authors introduce the Physical Information Bottleneck (PIB), which allocates matrix-based information bottlenecks to each PNN unit. This framework combines information theory and local learning to enable the training of PNNs across a variety of physical dynamics and hardware platforms.

Result: The paper demonstrates that PIB successfully enables supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning across different platforms (e.g., electronic memristive chips, optical computing), adapts to severe hardware faults, and supports geographically distributed parallel training.

Conclusion: PIB provides a scalable, intrinsic, and substrate-compatible solution for training PNNs, bypassing the need for auxiliary digital models and expanding the adaptability of deep learning to harness physical substrates.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern society but faces growing energy and latency constraints. Deep physical neural networks (PNNs) are interconnected computing systems that directly exploit analog dynamics for energy-efficient, ultrafast AI execution. Realizing this potential, however, requires universal training methods tailored to physical intricacies. Here, we present the Physical Information Bottleneck (PIB), a general and efficient framework that integrates information theory and local learning, enabling deep PNNs to learn under arbitrary physical dynamics. By allocating matrix-based information bottlenecks to each unit, we demonstrate supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning across electronic memristive chips and optical computing platforms. PIB also adapts to severe hardware faults and allows for parallel training via geographically distributed resources. Bypassing auxiliary digital models and contrastive measurements, PIB recasts PNN training as an intrinsic, scalable information-theoretic process compatible with diverse physical substrates.

TL;DR: FlexMARL is a training framework addressing system-level challenges in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and achieves substantial performance and utilization improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL training frameworks are inefficient as they primarily target single-agent scenarios and fail to address synchronization, load imbalance, and resource underutilization issues.

Method: FlexMARL introduces a joint orchestrator, micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline, parallel sampling with load balancing, and agent-centric resource allocation for MARL.

Result: FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x in large-scale production clusters, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FlexMARL provides an end-to-end optimized solution for scalable MARL training, tackling system-level inefficiencies and significantly boosting speed and resource utilization.

Abstract: Despite algorithm-level innovations for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the underlying networked infrastructure for large-scale MARL training remains underexplored. Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks.

*Donghwan Kim,Hyunsoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, leading to more accurate results without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Likelihood-based generative models (e.g., normalizing flows) often fail by assigning high likelihoods to OOD inputs, posing challenges in identifying in- vs out-of-distribution samples.

Method: The method adjusts input entropy using semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs less similar to an in-distribution memory bank, thereby increasing the log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD detection AUROC over baseline models on standard benchmarks, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Entropy control based on semantic similarity enhances OOD detection and works effectively without requiring additional training of the density model.

Abstract: Deep generative models that can tractably compute input likelihoods, including normalizing flows, often assign unexpectedly high likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We mitigate this likelihood paradox by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs that are less similar to an in-distribution memory bank. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation.

*Younes Bouhadjar,Emre Neftci*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that learning axonal or dendritic delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs) can achieve high accuracy while reducing memory and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal tasks often demand efficient and accurate neural network approaches. Existing synaptic delay learning methods are computationally expensive; this work explores axonal and dendritic delays as a resource-efficient alternative.

Method: Deep feedforward SNNs with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons were used to train axonal and dendritic delays. Comparisons are made against synaptic delay approaches and neuron models, with parameter adjustments for better performance.

Result: The models achieve up to 95.58% accuracy on the GSC dataset and 80.97% on the SSC dataset, matching or surpassing previous approaches. Axonal delays outperform dendritic in accuracy and resource efficiency. The performance remains robust under delay sparsity.

Conclusion: Learnable axonal and dendritic delays in SNNs provide an effective and resource-efficient approach to temporal representation, offering significant reductions in memory and computation without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Training transmission delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs) has been shown to substantially improve their performance on complex temporal tasks. In this work, we show that learning either axonal or dendritic delays enables deep feedforward SNNs composed of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to reach accuracy comparable to existing synaptic delay learning approaches, while significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. SNN models with either axonal or dendritic delays achieve up to $95.58\%$ on the Google Speech Command (GSC) and $80.97\%$ on the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) datasets, matching or exceeding prior methods based on synaptic delays or more complex neuron models. By adjusting the delay parameters, we obtain improved performance for synaptic delay learning baselines, strengthening the comparison. We find that axonal delays offer the most favorable trade-off, combining lower buffering requirements with slightly higher accuracy than dendritic delays. We further show that the performance of axonal and dendritic delay models is largely preserved under strong delay sparsity, with as few as $20\%$ of delays remaining active, further reducing buffering requirements. Overall, our results indicate that learnable axonal and dendritic delays provide a resource-efficient and effective mechanism for temporal representation in SNNs. Code will be made available publicly upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/YounesBouhadjar/AxDenSynDelaySNN

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the design of tendon-driven continuum robots, ensuring maximum feasible static workspace even under external loads.

Method: Used genetic algorithm optimization to maximize the robot's tip position within the static workspace while incorporating external forces and torques.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed method effectively identifies optimal tendon forces, enhancing the feasible static workspace.

Conclusion: The genetic algorithm-driven optimization approach is effective in achieving optimal design for tendon-driven continuum robots under diverse conditions.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the optimal design of a tendon-driven continuum robot (TDCR) based on its feasible static workspace (FSW). The TDCR under consideration is a two-segment robot driven by eight tendons, with four tendon actuators per segment. Tendon forces are treated as design variables, while the feasible static workspace (FSW) serves as the optimization objective. To determine the robot's feasible static workspace, a genetic algorithm optimization approach is employed to maximize a Euclidian norm of the TDCR's tip position over the workspace. During the simulations, the robot is subjected to external loads, including torques and forces. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying optimal tendon forces to maximize the feasible static workspace, even under the influence of external forces and torques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance social robot navigation in crowded settings by improving human trajectory prediction using skeletal features.

Method: Evaluating predictive utility of lower-body 2D/3D keypoints and biomechanical cues through experiments on JRDB and a new panoramic dataset.

Result: Lower-body 3D keypoints reduced error by 13%; biomechanical cues added a further 1-4% improvement across datasets.

Conclusion: Robots can predict human motion effectively using lower-body keypoints, shaping sensory design for social navigation.

Abstract: Predicting human trajectory is crucial for social robot navigation in crowded environments. While most existing approaches treat human as point mass, we present a study on multi-agent trajectory prediction that leverages different human skeletal features for improved forecast accuracy. In particular, we systematically evaluate the predictive utility of 2D and 3D skeletal keypoints and derived biomechanical cues as additional inputs. Through a comprehensive study on the JRDB dataset and another new dataset for social navigation with 360-degree panoramic videos, we find that focusing on lower-body 3D keypoints yields a 13% reduction in Average Displacement Error and augmenting 3D keypoint inputs with corresponding biomechanical cues provides a further 1-4% improvement. Notably, the performance gain persists when using 2D keypoint inputs extracted from equirectangular panoramic images, indicating that monocular surround vision can capture informative cues for motion forecasting. Our finding that robots can forecast human movement efficiently by watching their legs provides actionable insights for designing sensing capabilities for social robot navigation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new control framework for multi-legged robots to overcome challenges in coordinating high-dimensional systems, improving locomotion performance by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of principled control frameworks for multi-legged robots, which limits their locomotion potential despite hardware capability.

Method: The authors use geometric mechanics and a spin model duality from statistical mechanics to optimize gait reorganization and identify efficient locomotion strategies.

Result: The framework produces a 50% improvement in forward speed for a hexapod robot with the discovery of asymmetric locomotion strategies, validated by both simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: Introducing symmetry-breaking principles in control and hardware design enhances performance in multi-legged robotics, paving the way for innovative locomotion strategies.

Abstract: Legged robot research is presently focused on bipedal or quadrupedal robots, despite capabilities to build robots with many more legs to potentially improve locomotion performance. This imbalance is not necessarily due to hardware limitations, but rather to the absence of principled control frameworks that explain when and how additional legs improve locomotion performance. In multi-legged systems, coordinating many simultaneous contacts introduces a severe curse of dimensionality that challenges existing modeling and control approaches. As an alternative, multi-legged robots are typically controlled using low-dimensional gaits originally developed for bipeds or quadrupeds. These strategies fail to exploit the new symmetries and control opportunities that emerge in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we develop a principled framework for discovering new control structures in multi-legged locomotion. We use geometric mechanics to reduce contact-rich locomotion planning to a graph optimization problem, and propose a spin model duality framework from statistical mechanics to exploit symmetry breaking and guide optimal gait reorganization. Using this approach, we identify an asymmetric locomotion strategy for a hexapod robot that achieves a forward speed of 0.61 body lengths per cycle (a 50% improvement over conventional gaits). The resulting asymmetry appears at both the control and hardware levels. At the control level, the body orientation oscillates asymmetrically between fast clockwise and slow counterclockwise turning phases for forward locomotion. At the hardware level, two legs on the same side remain unactuated and can be replaced with rigid parts without degrading performance. Numerical simulations and robophysical experiments validate the framework and reveal novel locomotion behaviors that emerge from symmetry reforming in high-dimensional embodied systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation environments lack the diversity, dense clutter, articulated furniture, and physical properties required for realistic training and evaluation of home robots, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: SceneSmith uses a hierarchical framework involving VLM agents (designer, critic, and orchestrator) to build simulation scenes progressively. It integrates text-to-3D synthesis, dataset retrieval, and physical property estimation to create realistic environments.

Result: SceneSmith generates 3-6x more objects than prior methods with high realism (92%) and stability (96%) rates, outperforming baselines in prompt faithfulness and realism in a user study.

Conclusion: SceneSmith offers a step forward in generating realistic indoor environments that enhance robot training and evaluation capabilities, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency, realism, and simulation validity over existing methods.

Abstract: Simulation has become a key tool for training and evaluating home robots at scale, yet existing environments fail to capture the diversity and physical complexity of real indoor spaces. Current scene synthesis methods produce sparsely furnished rooms that lack the dense clutter, articulated furniture, and physical properties essential for robotic manipulation. We introduce SceneSmith, a hierarchical agentic framework that generates simulation-ready indoor environments from natural language prompts. SceneSmith constructs scenes through successive stages$\unicode{x2013}$from architectural layout to furniture placement to small object population$\unicode{x2013}$each implemented as an interaction among VLM agents: designer, critic, and orchestrator. The framework tightly integrates asset generation through text-to-3D synthesis for static objects, dataset retrieval for articulated objects, and physical property estimation. SceneSmith generates 3-6x more objects than prior methods, with <2% inter-object collisions and 96% of objects remaining stable under physics simulation. In a user study with 205 participants, it achieves 92% average realism and 91% average prompt faithfulness win rates against baselines. We further demonstrate that these environments can be used in an end-to-end pipeline for automatic robot policy evaluation.

Result: The framework and toolkit were evaluated through case studies and design workshops, demonstrating their effectiveness in structured exploration and collaborative robot design.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and toolkit successfully facilitate analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaboration in robot morphology design.

Abstract: Robot morphology, the form, shape, and structure of robots, is a key design space in human-robot interaction (HRI), shaping how robots function, express themselves, and interact with people. Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure. Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies. We evaluate the framework and toolkit through a case study and design workshops, showing how they support analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaborative robot design.

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid risk-aware navigation system for autonomous vessels, combining probabilistic risk maps and trajectory optimization to enhance safe navigation in dynamic marine environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robust and safe autonomous navigation in unpredictable and dynamic marine environments.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid system that uses probabilistic risk maps and a risk-biased Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner, combined with B-spline trajectory optimization.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed that the system effectively navigates dynamic obstacles, generates smooth trajectories, and adapts to environmental changes, performing better than conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed navigation framework improves operational safety and autonomy, making it a viable solution for autonomous missions in uncertain and dynamic maritime environments.

Abstract: Robust navigation in changing marine environments requires autonomous systems capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting under uncertainty. This study introduces a hybrid risk-aware navigation architecture that integrates probabilistic modeling of obstacles along the vehicle path with smooth trajectory optimization for autonomous surface vessels. The system constructs probabilistic risk maps that capture both obstacle proximity and the behavior of dynamic objects. A risk-biased Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner leverages these maps to generate collision-free paths, which are subsequently refined using B-spline algorithms to ensure trajectory continuity. Three distinct RRT* rewiring modes are implemented based on the cost function: minimizing the path length, minimizing risk, and optimizing a combination of the path length and total risk. The framework is evaluated in experimental scenarios containing both static and dynamic obstacles. The results demonstrate the system's ability to navigate safely, maintain smooth trajectories, and dynamically adapt to changing environmental risks. Compared with conventional LIDAR or vision-only navigation approaches, the proposed method shows improvements in operational safety and autonomy, establishing it as a promising solution for risk-aware autonomous vehicle missions in uncertain and dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a problem (MMLO-LMP) and presents a solution (DUBIOUS) for generating robot trajectories that are legible to some observers and illegible to others, considering their visibility and motives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for robots to balance communication of their intentions depending on the observers' motives and visibility in cooperative, adversarial, and mixed environments.

Method: The authors introduce a problem called MMLO-LMP and present DUBIOUS, a trajectory optimizer designed to solve this problem by balancing legibility for observers with positive motives and illegibility for those with negative motives, while factoring in visibility limitations.

Result: Their results indicate that DUBIOUS successfully generates trajectories that align with the mixed motives and visibility limitations of various observers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of optimizing trajectories for mixed-motive environments, with scope for future improvements like accounting for moving observers and observer cooperation.

Abstract: In cooperative environments, such as in factories or assistive scenarios, it is important for a robot to communicate its intentions to observers, who could be either other humans or robots. A legible trajectory allows an observer to quickly and accurately predict an agent's intention. In adversarial environments, such as in military operations or games, it is important for a robot to not communicate its intentions to observers. An illegible trajectory leads an observer to incorrectly predict the agent's intention or delays when an observer is able to make a correct prediction about the agent's intention. However, in some environments there are multiple observers, each of whom may be able to see only part of the environment, and each of whom may have different motives. In this work, we introduce the Mixed-Motive Limited-Observability Legible Motion Planning (MMLO-LMP) problem, which requires a motion planner to generate a trajectory that is legible to observers with positive motives and illegible to observers with negative motives while also considering the visibility limitations of each observer. We highlight multiple strategies an agent can take while still achieving the problem objective. We also present DUBIOUS, a trajectory optimizer that solves MMLO-LMP. Our results show that DUBIOUS can generate trajectories that balance legibility with the motives and limited visibility regions of the observers. Future work includes many variations of MMLO-LMP, including moving observers and observer teaming.

Abstract: Mobile robots are often deployed over long durations in diverse open, dynamic scenes, including indoor setting such as warehouses and manufacturing facilities, and outdoor settings such as agricultural and roadway operations. A core challenge is to build a scalable long-horizon memory that supports an agentic workflow for planning, retrieval, and reasoning over open-ended instructions at variable granularity, while producing precise, actionable answers for navigation. We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable TaskConditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning. Across the two datasets, STaR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher success rates and markedly lower spatial error. We further deploy STaR on a real Husky wheeled robot in both indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating robust longhorizon reasoning, scalability, and practical utility.

### [257] [Data-centric Design of Learning-based Surgical Gaze Perception Models in Multi-Task Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09259)
*Yizhou Li,Shuyuan Yang,Jiaji Su,Zonghe Chua*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores how the source of gaze supervision impacts attention models in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (RMIS) and assesses the substitutability of passive for active gaze data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the challenges posed by reduced haptic feedback and depth cues during RMIS, which increase reliance on expert visual perception. It aims to address the expensive and ambiguous nature of gaze data collection, emphasizing the need to understand the impact of gaze expertise levels and perceptual modalities on models.

Method: The authors created a dataset featuring paired active and passive gaze data collected during surgical drills on the da Vinci SimNow simulator. They analyzed skill- and modality-dependent differences in gaze patterns and assessed models trained on passive gaze versus active data using tools like fixation density and saliency modeling.

Result: The paper found that models trained on passive gaze (novice level) can approximate intermediate active gaze reasonably well, with noted performance degradation. Some models, like MSI-Net, offered stable predictions, whereas others, like SalGAN, showed instability. Results showed asymmetry in the transfer between active and passive gaze data.

Conclusion: Passive gaze labels, especially crowd-sourced from novices, can potentially serve as a scalable alternative for gaze supervision and surgical perception modeling, albeit with predictable limitations. This opens pathways for training novice clinicians more effectively in RMIS setups.

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS), reduced haptic feedback and depth cues increase reliance on expert visual perception, motivating gaze-guided training and learning-based surgical perception models. However, operative expert gaze is costly to collect, and it remains unclear how the source of gaze supervision, both expertise level (intermediate vs. novice) and perceptual modality (active execution vs. passive viewing), shapes what attention models learn. We introduce a paired active-passive, multi-task surgical gaze dataset collected on the da Vinci SimNow simulator across four drills. Active gaze was recorded during task execution using a VR headset with eye tracking, and the corresponding videos were reused as stimuli to collect passive gaze from observers, enabling controlled same-video comparisons. We quantify skill- and modality-dependent differences in gaze organization and evaluate the substitutability of passive gaze for operative supervision using fixation density overlap analyses and single-frame saliency modeling. Across settings, MSI-Net produced stable, interpretable predictions, whereas SalGAN was unstable and often poorly aligned with human fixations. Models trained on passive gaze recovered a substantial portion of intermediate active attention, but with predictable degradation, and transfer was asymmetric between active and passive targets. Notably, novice passive labels approximated intermediate-passive targets with limited loss on higher-quality demonstrations, suggesting a practical path for scalable, crowd-sourced gaze supervision in surgical coaching and perception modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and explore theoretical concepts of anthropomorphism and anthropomimesis, helping future HRI research to distinguish between user perception and designer intention.

Method: The paper offers theoretical definitions and exploration of the terms anthropomorphism and anthropomimesis, focusing on their distinct responsibilities in HRI.

Result: A clear disambiguation between anthropomorphism (perceptions by users) and anthropomimesis (intentions by designers) is established.

Conclusion: The theoretical clarification of these concepts is intended to aid future HRI research in robot design and evaluation.

Abstract: In this preliminary work, we offer an initial disambiguation of the theoretical concepts anthropomorphism and anthropomimesis in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We define anthropomorphism as users perceiving human-like qualities in robots, and anthropomimesis as robot developers designing human-like features into robots. This contribution aims to provide a clarification and exploration of these concepts for future HRI scholarship, particularly regarding the party responsible for human-like qualities - robot perceiver for anthropomorphism, and robot designer for anthropomimesis. We provide this contribution so that researchers can build on these disambiguated theoretical concepts for future robot design and evaluation.

### [259] [CAPER: Constrained and Procedural Reasoning for Robotic Scientific Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09367)
*Jinghan Yang,Jingyi Hou,Xinbo Yu,Wei He,Yifan Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CAPER introduces a new robotics framework for laboratory experimentation by ensuring procedural accuracy and robust operation even in low-data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many end-to-end robotic systems struggle with scientific tasks that require strict procedural correctness, low supervision, and robustness, often leading to errors or inefficiencies.

Method: CAPER restricts learning and reasoning within a structured pipeline, separating tasks into high-level planning, mid-level multimodal grounding, and low-level control with reinforcement learning, while using interpretable intermediate representations.

Result: CAPER consistently improves the success rate and adherence to procedural correctness in experiments, especially in low-data and long-horizon settings.

Conclusion: Separating responsibilities into distinct modules enhances robotics' ability to execute scientific workflows with greater reliability, controllability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Robotic assistance in scientific laboratories requires procedurally correct long-horizon manipulation, reliable execution under limited supervision, and robustness in low-demonstration regimes. Such conditions greatly challenge end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models, whose assumptions of recoverable errors and data-driven policy learning often break down in protocol-sensitive experiments. We propose CAPER, a framework for Constrained And ProcEdural Reasoning for robotic scientific experiments, which explicitly restricts where learning and reasoning occur in the planning and control pipeline. Rather than strengthening end-to-end policies, CAPER enforces a responsibility-separated structure: task-level reasoning generates procedurally valid action sequences under explicit constraints, mid-level multimodal grounding realizes subtasks without delegating spatial decision-making to large language models, and low-level control adapts to physical uncertainty via reinforcement learning with minimal demonstrations. By encoding procedural commitments through interpretable intermediate representations, CAPER prevents execution-time violations of experimental logic, improving controllability, robustness, and data efficiency. Experiments on a scientific workflow benchmark and a public long-horizon manipulation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in success rate and procedural correctness, particularly in low-data and long-horizon settings.

### [260] [Certified Gradient-Based Contact-Rich Manipulation via Smoothing-Error Reachable Tubes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09368)
*Wei-Chen Li,Glen Chou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in contact-rich manipulation by proposing a gradient-based policy synthesis method that utilizes smoothed dynamics with error compensation and guarantees robust constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-rich manipulation is hard to optimize due to discontinuous or vanishing gradients in hybrid contact dynamics, necessitating solutions for robust and efficient controller design.

Method: The authors use smoothed dynamics with quantified error compensation via a novel differentiable simulator based on convex optimization, optimizing feedback policies with guarantees for true hybrid dynamics.

Result: The method achieves robust constraint satisfaction and outperforms baselines in tasks like pushing, rotation, and dexterous manipulation with fewer violations and lower goal errors.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges differentiable physics and robust control to provide the first certifiable gradient-based policy synthesis method for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Gradient-based methods can efficiently optimize controllers using physical priors and differentiable simulators, but contact-rich manipulation remains challenging due to discontinuous or vanishing gradients from hybrid contact dynamics. Smoothing the dynamics yields continuous gradients, but the resulting model mismatch can cause controller failures when executed on real systems. We address this trade-off by planning with smoothed dynamics while explicitly quantifying and compensating for the induced errors, providing formal guarantees of constraint satisfaction and goal reachability on the true hybrid dynamics. Our method smooths both contact dynamics and geometry via a novel differentiable simulator based on convex optimization, which enables us to characterize the discrepancy from the true dynamics as a set-valued deviation. This deviation constrains the optimization of time-varying affine feedback policies through analytical bounds on the system's reachable set, enabling robust constraint satisfaction guarantees for the true closed-loop hybrid dynamics, while relying solely on informative gradients from the smoothed dynamics. We evaluate our method on several contact-rich tasks, including planar pushing, object rotation, and in-hand dexterous manipulation, achieving guaranteed constraint satisfaction with lower safety violation and goal error than baselines. By bridging differentiable physics with set-valued robust control, our method is the first certifiable gradient-based policy synthesis method for contact-rich manipulation.

*Minsung Yoon,Jeil Jeong,Sung-Eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phase-Aware Policy Learning (PAPL), a reinforcement learning framework for skateboarding control in quadruped robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skateboards are compact transportation devices, but using legged robots to control them is challenging due to the need for perception-driven decision-making and handling multi-modal control objectives across skateboarding phases.

Method: PAPL incorporates phase-conditioned Feature-wise Linear Modulation layers in actor and critic networks, leveraging skateboarding's cyclic nature to enable unified policies that adapt to phase-specific behaviors in quadruped robots.

Result: Simulations demonstrated accurate command tracking, efficient locomotion compared to baselines, and real-world applicability. Component ablation studies showed the significance of each framework element.

Conclusion: PAPL effectively enables quadruped robots to handle the complexities of controlling skateboards, offering a robust reinforcement learning solution with transferability from simulation to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Skateboards offer a compact and efficient means of transportation as a type of personal mobility device. However, controlling them with legged robots poses several challenges for policy learning due to perception-driven interactions and multi-modal control objectives across distinct skateboarding phases. To address these challenges, we introduce Phase-Aware Policy Learning (PAPL), a reinforcement-learning framework tailored for skateboarding with quadruped robots. PAPL leverages the cyclic nature of skateboarding by integrating phase-conditioned Feature-wise Linear Modulation layers into actor and critic networks, enabling a unified policy that captures phase-dependent behaviors while sharing robot-specific knowledge across phases. Our evaluations in simulation validate command-tracking accuracy and conduct ablation studies quantifying each component's contribution. We also compare locomotion efficiency against leg and wheel-leg baselines and show real-world transferability.

*Yiwen Pang,Bo Zhou,Changjin Li,Xuanhao Wang,Shengxiang Xu,Deng-Bao Wang,Min-Ling Zhang,Shimin Di*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a plugin for improving vision-language-action models in executing long-horizon scientific tasks by addressing transitional steps between atomic actions. The method enhances inference efficiency without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with composing long-horizon tasks from learned atomic actions due to distributional mismatches, limiting their application in autonomous scientific workflows.

Method: The authors propose an LLM-based agentic inference plugin that intervenes during sequential manipulation tasks by inferring and generating transitional robotic action code to guide VLA models.

Result: Experiments in simulated scientific environments show a 42% increase in average atomic task success rate, and the method is transferrable to real-world laboratories.

Conclusion: The plugin improves task execution efficiency and scalability for vision-language-action models, making them suitable for long-horizon experimental workflows in robotic laboratories.

Abstract: Robotic laboratories play a critical role in autonomous scientific discovery by enabling scalable, continuous experimental execution. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.

*Shuyuan Hu,Tao Lin,Kai Ye,Yang Yang,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework combining LLM reasoning and LTL to solve dynamic multi-robot planning efficiently, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and lack of kinematic feasibility in plans generated by LLMs for multi-robot tasks and overcome the computational and static constraints of formal methods like LTL.

Method: The authors propose a neuro-symbolic framework that uses hierarchical LTL specifications in conjunction with receding horizon planning and real-time perception. This enables dynamic task allocation and planning that adapts to stochastic environmental changes.

Result: Through extensive real-world experiments, the proposed approach demonstrated superior performance in success rates, interaction fluency, and reduced planning latency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between LLM-generated plans and the guarantees provided by formal methods, offering an efficient solution for dynamic multi-robot task planning scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.

### [264] [Optimal Control of Microswimmers for Trajectory Tracking Using Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09563)
*Lucas Palazzolo,Mickaël Binois,Laëtitia Giraldi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops an optimal control strategy using B-spline parametrization and Bayesian optimization for trajectory tracking of microswimmers, overcoming challenges posed by low-Reynolds-number dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microswimmers operate at low Reynolds numbers, where complex dynamics make control design difficult. Effective trajectory tracking can advance the microrobotics field.

Method: The authors combine B-spline parametrization with Bayesian optimization to solve the trajectory tracking problem without relying on complex gradient computations.

Result: The proposed method successfully recreates both biologically inspired trajectories and compensates for hydrodynamic effects in different swimmer models, demonstrating adaptability and versatility across ODE and PDE-based systems.

Conclusion: Bayesian optimization is highlighted as a robust and generalizable tool for microscale locomotion control, addressing fluid-structure interaction complexities.

Abstract: Trajectory tracking for microswimmers remains a key challenge in microrobotics, where low-Reynolds-number dynamics make control design particularly complex. In this work, we formulate the trajectory tracking problem as an optimal control problem and solve it using a combination of B-spline parametrization with Bayesian optimization, allowing the treatment of high computational costs without requiring complex gradient computations. Applied to a flagellated magnetic swimmer, the proposed method reproduces a variety of target trajectories, including biologically inspired paths observed in experimental studies. We further evaluate the approach on a three-sphere swimmer model, demonstrating that it can adapt to and partially compensate for wall-induced hydrodynamic effects. The proposed optimization strategy can be applied consistently across models of different fidelity, from low-dimensional ODE-based models to high-fidelity PDE-based simulations, showing its robustness and generality. These results highlight the potential of Bayesian optimization as a versatile tool for optimal control strategies in microscale locomotion under complex fluid-structure interactions.

### [265] [Sample-Efficient Real-World Dexterous Policy Fine-Tuning via Action-Chunked Critics and Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09580)
*Chenyu Yang,Denis Tarasov,Davide Liconti,Hehui Zheng,Robert K. Katzschmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOFT-FLOW, a framework addressing challenges in fine-tuning dexterous manipulation policies by leveraging normalizing flows for multimodal policy updates and chunk-level credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fine-tuning dexterous manipulation policies in real-world settings struggle due to limited interaction budgets and challenges in handling multimodal action distributions.

Method: The framework utilizes normalizing flow policies for exact likelihood estimation and employs action-chunked critics for improved long-horizon credit assignment.

Result: SOFT-FLOW demonstrated sample-efficient adaptation and stability in challenging dexterous manipulation tasks compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: SOFT-FLOW presents a viable solution for more effective fine-tuning of complex robotic manipulation policies in real-world applications.

Abstract: Real-world fine-tuning of dexterous manipulation policies remains challenging due to limited real-world interaction budgets and highly multimodal action distributions. Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons. On these tasks, SOFT-FLOW achieves stable, sample-efficient adaptation where standard methods struggle.

*Marco Moletta,Michael C. Welle,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study focuses on enabling robots to adapt to human-preferred manipulation styles, specifically in tasks involving deformable objects like clothing, using a novel approach called RKO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better personalize robotic behavior by catering to subtle, human preferences in manipulation tasks, especially in handling deformable objects, which has been underexplored.

Method: The paper introduces RKO, a preference-alignment method combining benefits from RPO and KTO frameworks, and evaluates it through experiments on cloth-folding tasks using limited demonstrations.

Result: RKO outperforms standard diffusion policy fine-tuning and other preference learning frameworks in terms of performance and sample efficiency for personalized cloth manipulation.

Conclusion: Structured preference learning, exemplified by the RKO method, is both effective and essential for scaling personalized robotic behaviors in complex tasks involving deformable objects.

Abstract: Humans naturally develop preferences for how manipulation tasks should be performed, which are often subtle, personal, and difficult to articulate. Although it is important for robots to account for these preferences to increase personalization and user satisfaction, they remain largely underexplored in robotic manipulation, particularly in the context of deformable objects like garments and fabrics. In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning. These results highlight the importance and feasibility of structured preference learning for scaling personalized robot behavior in complex deformable object manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToucHD, a detailed tactile dataset, and AnyTouch 2, a representation learning framework enhancing tactile perception for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing tactile datasets and models by focusing on fine-grained, dynamic tactile perception rather than just object-level attributes.

Method: The researchers developed ToucHD, a hierarchical tactile dataset supporting multi-level tactile perception, and designed AnyTouch 2 for tactile representation learning that captures pixel-specific deformations and force dynamics.

Result: AnyTouch 2 was tested on diverse benchmarks and demonstrated robust performance across static and dynamic tactile perception tasks with various sensors.

Conclusion: The integration of ToucHD and AnyTouch 2 improves robots' tactile understanding and dynamic manipulation capabilities, showcasing better performance in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleGate, a novel whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high accuracy without performance loss from knowledge distillation and improves dynamic motion tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the challenge of building a robust unified controller for humanoid robots to support diverse, dynamic human-like motions in unstructured environments.

Method: The framework utilizes a gating network that activates domain-specific experts dynamically and also employs a VAE-based motion prior to infer future motion intent from historical data for anticipatory control.

Result: TeleGate achieves high-precision tracking of dynamic motions like running, jumping, and fall recovery in real-time teleoperation using only 2.5 hours of training data, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: By preserving expert capabilities and introducing anticipatory control, TeleGate provides an efficient and robust solution to real-time humanoid robot teleoperation across diverse and complex motions.

Abstract: Real-time whole-body teleoperation is a critical method for humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in unstructured environments. However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoFly, a model for autonomous UAV navigation using vision-language-action integration and a novel dataset focused on real-world navigation behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current UAV navigation systems that rely on detailed, pre-specified instructions, limiting effectiveness in unknown environments.

Method: AutoFly uses a pseudo-depth encoder and a progressive two-stage training process to align visual, depth, and language representations with actions. A new dataset emphasizing autonomy rather than instruction-following is developed.

Result: AutoFly improves UAV navigation success rates by 3.9% over state-of-the-art methods and performs consistently in simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: The approach enhances realistic UAV navigation capabilities by combining innovative models and datasets, advancing embodied AI navigation.

Abstract: Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires intelligent agents to navigate environments by interpreting linguistic instructions alongside visual observations, serving as a cornerstone task in Embodied AI. Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in multi-robot exploration of uncertain terrains, notably efficient coordination, reliable hotspot engagement, and reducing redundancy in operations.

Method: The proposed method integrates particle-filter localisation, a behavior-based controller, gradient-driven hotspot exploitation, and a virtual pheromone mechanism for coordinating robots.

Result: Experiments reveal that particle filtering is crucial for hotspot reliability, coordination reduces overlap, and larger teams improve coverage but encounter diminishing returns due to interference.

Conclusion: The methods proposed enhance exploration efficiency and support tasks of hotspot recall and coverage, acknowledging trade-offs in team size and navigation fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents RANT, an ant-inspired multi-robot exploration framework for noisy, uncertain environments. A team of differential-drive robots navigates a 10 x 10 m terrain, collects noisy probe measurements of a hidden richness field, and builds local probabilistic maps while the supervisor maintains a global evaluation. RANT combines particle-filter localisation, a behaviour-based controller with gradient-driven hotspot exploitation, and a lightweight no-revisit coordination mechanism based on virtual pheromone blocking. We experimentally analyse how team size, localisation fidelity, and coordination influence coverage, hotspot recall, and redundancy. Results show that particle filtering is essential for reliable hotspot engagement, coordination substantially reduces overlap, and increasing team size improves coverage but yields diminishing returns due to interference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional non-holonomic robotic motion planners face challenges with scalability in complex environments and computational burdens due to increased complexity.

Method: The method involves deterministic free-space decomposition to create compact graphs of overlapping rectangular corridors, reducing search space without compromising path resolution. An analytical planner generates kinematically-feasible trajectories.

Result: Simulation and physical robot experiments validate the framework's efficiency in enabling large-scale, near-time-optimal navigation in structured environments.

Conclusion: This framework offers an effective and scalable solution for autonomous mobile robots in structured environments, addressing both computational efficiency and practical applicability. Open-source availability ensures accessibility for broader use.

Abstract: We present a complete framework for fast motion planning of non-holonomic autonomous mobile robots in highly complex but structured environments. Conventional grid-based planners struggle with scalability, while many kinematically-feasible planners impose a significant computational burden due to their search space complexity. To overcome these limitations, our approach introduces a deterministic free-space decomposition that creates a compact graph of overlapping rectangular corridors. This method enables a significant reduction in the search space, without sacrificing path resolution. The framework then performs online motion planning by finding a sequence of rectangles and generating a near-time-optimal, kinematically-feasible trajectory using an analytical planner. The result is a highly efficient solution for large-scale navigation. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and on a physical robot. The implementation is publicly available as open-source software.

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic control, identifying challenges and providing practical training insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness and challenges of scaling large-scale VLA models for robotics, where data is varied across embodiments and contexts, and to provide practical guidance for improving performance.

Method: The study uses a controlled analysis with a representative VLA framework combining vision-language backbone and flow-matching. It introduces a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol to minimize bias and investigates three dimensions: physical alignment, embodiment mixture, and training regularization. Extensive experiments are conducted in simulations and real-robot scenarios.

Result: Finds that unified EEF-relative action representation is crucial for cross-embodiment transfer; pooling heterogeneous datasets can induce negative transfer; and techniques like sensory dropout and fine-tuning don't consistently ensure performance improvements.

Conclusion: Scaling VLA models for robotics requires careful consideration of design choices as common assumptions don't always hold. The insights provided can guide effective training of large-scale VLA policies.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong promise for generalist robot control, it remains unclear whether -- and under what conditions -- the standard "scale data" recipe translates to robotics, where training data is inherently heterogeneous across embodiments, sensors, and action spaces. We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

*Xijie Huang,Weiqi Gai,Tianyue Wu,Congyu Wang,Zhiyang Liu,Xin Zhou,Yuze Wu,Fei Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NavDreamer introduces a video-based framework for 3D navigation leveraging generative video models for improved generalization and navigation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models face challenges due to limited and diverse data collection requirements as well as static representations lacking spatiotemporal dynamics.

Method: NavDreamer uses generative video models to translate language instructions into trajectories, optimized via sampling and scoring with VLMs, and employs an inverse dynamics model for waypoint decoding.

Result: Experiments showcase robust generalization in novel objects and unseen environments across benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of video-based planning.

Conclusion: Video-based frameworks, with spatiotemporal and physical dynamics encoding, are highly effective for generalization in navigation tasks, particularly for high-level decision-making.

Abstract: Previous Vision-Language-Action models face critical limitations in navigation: scarce, diverse data from labor-intensive collection and static representations that fail to capture temporal dynamics and physical laws. We propose NavDreamer, a video-based framework for 3D navigation that leverages generative video models as a universal interface between language instructions and navigation trajectories. Our main hypothesis is that video's ability to encode spatiotemporal information and physical dynamics, combined with internet-scale availability, enables strong zero-shot generalization in navigation. To mitigate the stochasticity of generative predictions, we introduce a sampling-based optimization method that utilizes a VLM for trajectory scoring and selection. An inverse dynamics model is employed to decode executable waypoints from generated video plans for navigation. To systematically evaluate this paradigm in several video model backbones, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering object navigation, precise navigation, spatial grounding, language control, and scene reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate robust generalization across novel objects and unseen environments, with ablation studies revealing that navigation's high-level decision-making nature makes it particularly suited for video-based planning.

*Ruopeng Cui,Yifei Bi,Haojie Luo,Wei Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper tackles the inefficiencies in reinforcement and imitation learning by introducing the Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture for unsupervised skill discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in reinforcement and imitation learning struggle with low efficiency and reward hacking when mastering diverse skills.

Method: Introduced the Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture and a multi-discriminator framework to improve skill diversity and training efficiency.

Result: The approach demonstrated on a Unitree A1 robot achieved an 18.3% expansion in state-space coverage compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The OMoE framework enhances training efficiency, mitigates reward hacking, and supports diverse skill acquisition in robotics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning necessitates meticulous reward shaping by specialists to elicit target behaviors, while imitation learning relies on costly task-specific data. In contrast, unsupervised skill discovery can potentially reduce these burdens by learning a diverse repertoire of useful skills driven by intrinsic motivation. However, existing methods exhibit two key limitations: they typically rely on a single policy to master a versatile repertoire of behaviors without modeling the shared structure or distinctions among them, which results in low learning efficiency; moreover, they are susceptible to reward hacking, where the reward signal increases and converges rapidly while the learned skills display insufficient actual diversity. In this work, we introduce an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that prevents diverse behaviors from collapsing into overlapping representations, enabling a single policy to master a wide spectrum of locomotion skills. In addition, we design a multi-discriminator framework in which different discriminators operate on distinct observation spaces, effectively mitigating reward hacking. We evaluated our method on the 12-DOF Unitree A1 quadruped robot, demonstrating a diverse set of locomotion skills. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework boosts training efficiency and yields an 18.3\% expansion in state-space coverage compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and accelerate reactive robot programming, reducing the need for extensively trained programmers.

Method: Combining AI techniques like large language models, planning, genetic programming, Bayesian optimization, and a graphical user interface for BT creation.

Result: User study shows improved performance in robot programming tasks when using BETR-GUI, outperforming standalone AI methods.

Conclusion: BETR-GUI effectively assists users in robot programming and highlights the benefits of combining AI methods with human interaction.

Abstract: The possibility to create reactive robot programs faster without the need for extensively trained programmers is becoming increasingly important. So far, it has not been explored how various techniques for creating Behavior Tree (BT) program representations could be combined with complete graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow a human user to validate and edit trees suggested by automated methods. In this paper, we introduce BEhavior TRee GUI (BETR-GUI) for creating BTs with the help of an AI assistant that combines methods using large language models, planning, genetic programming, and Bayesian optimization with a drag-and-drop editor. A user study with 60 participants shows that by combining different assistive methods, BETR-GUI enables users to perform better at solving the robot programming tasks. The results also show that humans using the full variant of BETR-GUI perform better than the AI assistant running on its own.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents BagelVLA, a model combining linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation to improve manipulation tasks, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance manipulation tasks by integrating reasoning, forecasting physical outcomes, and precise action generation, addressing the limitation of prior models focusing on isolated functionalities.

Method: Proposes BagelVLA, a unified framework trained on textual reasoning and visual prediction during action execution. Uses Residual Flow Guidance (RFG) for efficient integration of visual features to guide actions.

Result: BagelVLA outperforms existing models in simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly excelling in multi-stage reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: BagelVLA represents a significant advance by integrating multiple capabilities into one model, effectively addressing complex, long-horizon manipulation challenges.

Abstract: Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TriPilot-FF, a teleoperation system for bimanual mobile manipulators using foot pedals and body-based control, enhancing human-robot interaction and precise movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing hand-centric teleoperation systems for bimanual mobile manipulators by exploring foot-operated channels and providing intuitive control with obstacle awareness.

Method: Developed a system combining foot-operated pedal control with lidar-driven haptics, bimanual upper body control, and force feedback for improved manipulability and collision-averse behavior.

Result: TriPilot-FF enhances operator performance in tasks requiring precise movement, integrates feedback into action chunking policies, and shows improved results in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: The pedal-based teleoperation system improves whole-body robot manipulation and opens new avenues for integrating human control with robotic systems via intuitive interfaces.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators broaden the operational envelope for robot manipulation. However, the whole-body teleoperation of such robots remains a problem: operators must coordinate a wheeled base and two arms while reasoning about obstacles and contact. Existing interfaces are predominantly hand-centric (e.g., VR controllers and joysticks), leaving foot-operated channels underexplored for continuous base control. We present TriPilot-FF, an open-source whole-body teleoperation system for a custom bimanual mobile manipulator that introduces a foot-operated pedal with lidar-driven pedal haptics, coupled with upper-body bimanual leader-follower teleoperation. Using only a low-cost base-mounted lidar, TriPilot-FF renders a resistive pedal cue from proximity-to-obstacle signals in the commanded direction, shaping operator commands toward collision-averse behaviour without an explicit collision-avoidance controller. The system also supports arm-side force reflection for contact awareness and provides real-time force and visual guidance of bimanual manipulability to prompt mobile base repositioning, thereby improving reach. We demonstrate the capability of TriPilot-FF to effectively ``co-pilot'' the human operator over long time-horizons and tasks requiring precise mobile base movement and coordination. Finally, we incorporate teleoperation feedback signals into an Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) policy and demonstrate improved performance when the additional information is available. We release the pedal device design, full software stack, and conduct extensive real-world evaluations on a bimanual wheeled platform. The project page of TriPilot-FF is http://bit.ly/46H3ZJT.

TL;DR: TaCo is the first benchmark for compressing tactile data, evaluating 30 methods and introducing new tailored codecs to enhance compression efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient tactile data compression is vital for real-time robotic applications but remains underexplored due to the complexity of tactile data.

Method: The study introduced TaCo to evaluate tactile data compression methods systematically across datasets, involving lossless and lossy codecs, and tailored neural solutions.

Result: TaCo validates the superior performance of the newly developed codecs, TaCo-LL and TaCo-L, and benchmarks trade-offs in compression and task performance.

Conclusion: TaCo establishes a foundational framework enabling future advancements in tactile data compression and perception for robotics.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for embodied intelligence, providing fine-grained perception and control in complex environments. However, efficient tactile data compression, which is essential for real-time robotic applications under strict bandwidth constraints, remains underexplored. The inherent heterogeneity and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile data further complicate this challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L. This benchmark provides a foundational framework for understanding the critical trade-offs between compression efficiency and task performance, paving the way for future advances in tactile perception.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a compact, fully on-device pipeline enabling robots to reliably execute human instructions using natural language. It focuses on efficient instruction-to-action parsing and trajectory generation without reliance on cloud services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often fail to follow free-form human instructions in real-world environments due to computational and sensing constraints. The paper aims to address these limitations by developing a lightweight, on-device solution.

Method: The system comprises two components: (i) Instruct2Act, a BiLSTM-based parser with multi-head-attention autoencoder, converting instructions into atomic action sequences; (ii) Robot Action Network (RAN), leveraging DATRN and YOLOv8 for trajectory generation and environment analysis.

Result: Instruct2Act achieves 91.5% accuracy in sub-action predictions, while real-robot evaluations show 90% task success across four tasks. Sub-action inference is completed in under 3.8 seconds, and full task execution takes 30-60 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates deterministic and real-time robotic manipulation capabilities in resource-limited environments, utilizing fine-grained parsing and efficient trajectory generation methods.

Abstract: Robots often struggle to follow free-form human instructions in real-world settings due to computational and sensing limitations. We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hydra-Nav combines adaptive reasoning to tackle inefficiency and ineffectiveness in vision-language models for object goal navigation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models face challenges in success rates and efficiently localizing unseen objects due to weak temporal-spatial reasoning and high computational costs of reasoning methods.

Method: Hydra-Nav employs an adaptive architecture that switches between a slow deliberative system and a fast reactive system, trained through a three-stage curriculum to strengthen reasoning and decision-making.

Result: Hydra-Nav outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (HM3D, MP3D, OVON) by up to 21.2% and introduces a new metric (SOT) to demonstrate enhanced search efficiency.

Conclusion: Adaptive reasoning in Hydra-Nav significantly improves both performance and efficiency in object goal navigation tasks over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) show promise for object goal navigation, current methods still struggle with low success rates and inefficient localization of unseen objects--failures primarily attributed to weak temporal-spatial reasoning. Meanwhile, recent attempts to inject reasoning into VLM-based agents improve success rates but incur substantial computational overhead. To address both the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing approaches, we introduce Hydra-Nav, a unified VLM architecture that adaptively switches between a deliberative slow system for analyzing exploration history and formulating high-level plans, and a reactive fast system for efficient execution. We train Hydra-Nav through a three-stage curriculum: (i) spatial-action alignment to strengthen trajectory planning, (ii) memory-reasoning integration to enhance temporal-spatial reasoning over long-horizon exploration, and (iii) iterative rejection fine-tuning to enable selective reasoning at critical decision points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hydra-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM3D, MP3D, and OVON benchmarks, outperforming the second-best methods by 11.1%, 17.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce SOT (Success weighted by Operation Time), a new metric to measure search efficiency across VLMs with varying reasoning intensity. Results show that adaptive reasoning significantly enhances search efficiency over fixed-frequency baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource with data, benchmarks, and models for improving generalization of vision-language-action systems in robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manipulation datasets are limited in cost, coverage, diversity, and rely on intermediate supervision, making robust robotic learning challenging.

Method: The authors developed RoboInter-Tool for semi-automatic annotation, RoboInter-Data with comprehensive annotation, and integrated these into benchmarks and frameworks like RoboInter-VQA and RoboInter-VLA.

Result: RoboInter-Data offers a large-scale annotated dataset with 230k episodes and high-quality intermediate representations. Benchmarks and models systematically improve embodied reasoning and plan-then-execute capabilities.

Conclusion: RoboInter paves the way for robust, scalable, and generalizable robotic learning using fine-grained intermediate representations.

Abstract: Advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have stimulated growing interest in vision-language-action (VLA) systems for robot manipulation. However, existing manipulation datasets remain costly to curate, highly embodiment-specific, and insufficient in coverage and diversity, thereby hindering the generalization of VLA models. Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision. In total, RoboInter establishes a practical foundation for advancing robust and generalizable robotic learning via fine-grained and diverse intermediate representations.

TL;DR: The study presents an acoustic package delivery detection algorithm for UAVs using a ground-based microphone array, achieving high accuracy in detecting drones and delivery events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of UAVs for illicit deliveries in restricted zones (e.g., prisons) poses a significant security issue, but little attention has been given to identifying delivery events acoustically.

Method: A ground-based microphone array is used to detect drones and estimate propeller speed through a deep neural network analyzing mel spectrograms, identifying delivery events based on sudden blade passing frequency changes.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves 97% drone detection accuracy, delivery event detection accuracy of 96%, and identifies events up to a 100-meter range with a false positive rate of 8%.

Conclusion: Acoustic signals can effectively detect UAV deliveries in restricted zones, providing a reliable and innovative security measure for addressing these challenges.

Abstract: In recent years, the illicit use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for deliveries in restricted area such as prisons became a significant security challenge. While numerous studies have focused on UAV detection or localization, little attention has been given to delivery events identification. This study presents the first acoustic package delivery detection algorithm using a ground-based microphone array. The proposed method estimates both the drone's propeller speed and the delivery event using solely acoustic features. A deep neural network detects the presence of a drone and estimates the propeller's rotation speed or blade passing frequency (BPF) from a mel spectrogram. The algorithm analyzes the BPFs to identify probable delivery moments based on sudden changes before and after a specific time. Results demonstrate a mean absolute error of the blade passing frequency estimator of 16 Hz when the drone is less than 150 meters away from the microphone array. The drone presence detection estimator has a accuracy of 97%. The delivery detection algorithm correctly identifies 96% of events with a false positive rate of 8%. This study shows that deliveries can be identified using acoustic signals up to a range of 100 meters.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of lane changing for CAVs in dense traffic through the proposed Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), which balances safety and traffic efficiency using Control Barrier Functions and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane changing in dense traffic for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) presents trade-offs between safety and traffic efficiency, which existing controllers often fail to consider simultaneously.

Method: The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS) using Control Barrier Functions to ensure safe lane changes and collaborative traffic interactions. It integrates MASS into a MARL lane change controller with a customized reward function focused on efficiency.

Result: MASS enables safe and collaborative lane changes in congested traffic while improving the stability of MARL policies through a safety shield and custom reward structure.

Conclusion: MARL-MASS successfully balances the trade-off between safety and traffic efficiency in dense traffic scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness as a collaborative lane change controller.

Abstract: Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic. The code for MARL-MASS is available with an open-source licence at https://github.com/hkbharath/MARL-MASS

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TF-Gripper, a low-cost, force-controlled gripper for robotic manipulation with tactile feedback and a novel framework RETAF for precise force regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Force modulation is essential for robots to manipulate everyday objects without damaging them, but current grippers are expensive or ineffective for sensitive tasks.

Method: TF-Gripper is a $150 gripper incorporating tactile sensing. RETAF, a framework for force control, uses high-frequency signal processing, wrist images, and tactile feedback.

Result: Evaluation on five tasks showed improved grasp stability and task performance. RETAF outperformed existing baselines and can work with various base policies.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the benefits of direct force control and tactile feedback in robotic manipulation, opening avenues for scalable policy learning.

Abstract: Successfully manipulating many everyday objects, such as potato chips, requires precise force regulation. Failure to modulate force can lead to task failure or irreversible damage to the objects. Humans can precisely achieve this by adapting force from tactile feedback, even within a short period of physical contact. We aim to give robots this capability. However, commercial grippers exhibit high cost or high minimum force, making them unsuitable for studying force-controlled policy learning with everyday force-sensitive objects. We introduce TF-Gripper, a low-cost (~$150) force-controlled parallel-jaw gripper that integrates tactile sensing as feedback. It has an effective force range of 0.45-45N and is compatible with different robot arms. Additionally, we designed a teleoperation device paired with TF-Gripper to record human-applied grasping forces. While standard low-frequency policies can be trained on this data, they struggle with the reactive, contact-dependent nature of force regulation. To overcome this, we propose RETAF (REactive Tactile Adaptation of Force), a framework that decouples grasping force control from arm pose prediction. RETAF regulates force at high frequency using wrist images and tactile feedback, while a base policy predicts end-effector pose and gripper open/close action. We evaluate TF-Gripper and RETAF across five real-world tasks requiring precise force regulation. Results show that compared to position control, direct force control significantly improves grasp stability and task performance. We further show that tactile feedback is essential for force regulation, and that RETAF consistently outperforms baselines and can be integrated with various base policies. We hope this work opens a path for scaling the learning of force-controlled policies in robotic manipulation. Project page: https://force-gripper.github.io .

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces RoboSubtaskNet, a framework for sub-task segmentation in videos to enhance human-robot collaboration, validated through empirical benchmarks and physical trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safe human-robot collaboration by accurately identifying and classifying sub-task segments in long untrimmed videos, enabling better robot-executable tasks.

Method: The study presents RoboSubtaskNet, a framework coupling attention-enhanced I3D features with a customized MS-TCN using a Fibonacci dilation schedule and composite objective training. Introduced RoboSubtask dataset for testing.

Result: RoboSubtaskNet outperformed baseline models on various benchmarks (e.g., F1 @ 50 of 94.2% and Acc of 92.2% on RoboSubtask). Successful trials were observed in real-world robotic setups with 91.25% task success.

Conclusion: RoboSubtaskNet offers a viable approach to transitioning from video task segmentation to practical robotic manipulation, achieving high accuracy and reliability across benchmarks and experimental setups.

Abstract: Temporally locating and classifying fine-grained sub-task segments in long, untrimmed videos is crucial to safe human-robot collaboration. Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.

### [286] [A Collision-Free Sway Damping Model Predictive Controller for Safe and Reactive Forestry Crane Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10035)
*Marc-Philip Ecker,Christoph Fröhlich,Johannes Huemer,David Gruber,Bernhard Bischof,Tobias Glück,Wolfgang Kemmetmüller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified model predictive controller (MPC) for forestry cranes that ensures simultaneous collision avoidance and payload sway damping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in forestry crane operation separately address collision avoidance and payload sway control, creating inefficiencies in dynamic, unstructured outdoor environments.

Method: A collision-free, sway-damping MPC is developed, integrating LiDAR-based mapping and online Euclidean distance fields (EDF) directly into the control framework for real-time adjustments.

Result: Experimental tests on a real forestry crane showed effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance, even under disturbances and environmental changes.

Conclusion: The proposed controller provides a practical solution for safe and efficient navigation of forestry cranes by uniting sway control and collision avoidance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Forestry cranes operate in dynamic, unstructured outdoor environments where simultaneous collision avoidance and payload sway control are critical for safe navigation. Existing approaches address these challenges separately, either focusing on sway damping with predefined collision-free paths or performing collision avoidance only at the global planning level. We present the first collision-free, sway-damping model predictive controller (MPC) for a forestry crane that unifies both objectives in a single control framework. Our approach integrates LiDAR-based environment mapping directly into the MPC using online Euclidean distance fields (EDF), enabling real-time environmental adaptation. The controller simultaneously enforces collision constraints while damping payload sway, allowing it to (i) replan upon quasi-static environmental changes, (ii) maintain collision-free operation under disturbances, and (iii) provide safe stopping when no bypass exists. Experimental validation on a real forestry crane demonstrates effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance. A video can be found at https://youtu.be/tEXDoeLLTxA.

*Xinyuan Liu,Eren Sadikoglu,Ransalu Senanayake,Lixiao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'humanoid factors,' a framework for designing humanoid robots to effectively coexist and collaborate with humans, addressing physical, cognitive, social, and ethical considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of integrating humanoid robots into human environments, where they must align with human-like behavior, communication, and social expectations.

Method: The authors propose a four-pillar framework (physical, cognitive, social, and ethical) and applied it to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, highlighting gaps in conventional metrics that neglect human cognitive and interaction principles.

Result: The framework identified limitations in existing task completion metrics for humanoid robots and emphasized the need for harmonizing human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: The paper positions humanoid factors as an essential tool for designing, evaluating, and governing human-humanoid coexistence, focusing on both technical and human principles.

Abstract: Human factors research has long focused on optimizing environments, tools, and systems to account for human performance. Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes UniVTAC, a simulation-based platform for generating scalable visuo-tactile data to address challenges in tactile-driven manipulation tasks, and demonstrates improved results by using its encoder in robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of vision-only approaches in contact-rich manipulation tasks and address the challenges of acquiring large-scale, reliable tactile data and the lack of unified evaluation platforms.

Method: The researchers developed UniVTAC, a visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports multiple sensors and enables scalable data generation. They also introduced the UniVTAC Encoder trained on simulation-synthesized data and a benchmark for evaluating manipulation tasks.

Result: Using the UniVTAC Encoder achieved a 17.1% improvement in the UniVTAC Benchmark's success rate and a 25% improvement in real-world robotic tasks.

Conclusion: UniVTAC demonstrates the potential to enhance tactile-driven manipulation tasks effectively, providing a foundation for simulating, learning, and evaluating visuo-tactile policies.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation has seen rapid progress with vision-language-action (VLA) policies. However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

*Jingwen Sun,Wenyao Zhang,Zekun Qi,Shaojie Ren,Zezhi Liu,Hanxin Zhu,Guangzhong Sun,Xin Jin,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes VLA-JEPA, a pretraining framework for Vision-Language-Action policies, addressing pixel bias and enhancing robustness in action-relevant state transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of latent-action objectives in Vision-Language-Action policies, which often lead to appearance biases and information leakage, and improve generalization and robustness in real-world tasks.

Method: VLA-JEPA is a framework that enables leakage-free state prediction via latent representations. By separating future information as a target encoder and ensuring observations rely only on current inputs, it enhances dynamics abstractions.

Result: Experiments show VLA-JEPA performs better in generalization and robustness compared to existing latent-action methods across simulated and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-JEPA simplifies latent-action model pipelines and demonstrates superior performance across diverse environments, making it more robust for pretraining Vision-Language-Action policies.

Abstract: Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robo3R improves robotic manipulation by providing real-time, precise 3D reconstructions directly from RGB images and robot states, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D spatial perception solutions for robotic manipulation struggle with noisy depth sensors and imprecise reconstruction models, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Robo3R is a real-time model that integrates RGB images and robot states to predict precise 3D geometry using scale-invariant geometry, learned global transformations, and fine-grained point clouds.

Result: Robo3R outperforms state-of-the-art methods and sensors on various tasks using a synthetic dataset of 4 million annotated frames.

Conclusion: This solution significantly enhances performance for downstream robotic manipulation tasks, showcasing its potential as an advanced 3D sensing module.

Abstract: 3D spatial perception is fundamental to generalizable robotic manipulation, yet obtaining reliable, high-quality 3D geometry remains challenging. Depth sensors suffer from noise and material sensitivity, while existing reconstruction models lack the precision and metric consistency required for physical interaction. We introduce Robo3R, a feed-forward, manipulation-ready 3D reconstruction model that predicts accurate, metric-scale scene geometry directly from RGB images and robot states in real time. Robo3R jointly infers scale-invariant local geometry and relative camera poses, which are unified into the scene representation in the canonical robot frame via a learned global similarity transformation. To meet the precision demands of manipulation, Robo3R employs a masked point head for sharp, fine-grained point clouds, and a keypoint-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) formulation to refine camera extrinsics and global alignment. Trained on Robo3R-4M, a curated large-scale synthetic dataset with four million high-fidelity annotated frames, Robo3R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and depth sensors. Across downstream tasks including imitation learning, sim-to-real transfer, grasp synthesis, and collision-free motion planning, we observe consistent gains in performance, suggesting the promise of this alternative 3D sensing module for robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexImit converts human manipulation videos into robot data for training dexterous robotic hands using a 4-stage pipeline, addressing data scarcity and embodiment gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of data scarcity and the high cost of real-world data collection for training dexterous robotic hands.

Method: DexImit utilizes a 4-stage automated pipeline: reconstructing hand-object interactions, subtask decomposition, synthesizing robotic trajectories, and augmenting data for deployment.

Result: DexImit can generate diverse robot data from human videos, enabling tasks such as tool use, long-horizon, and fine-grained manipulations.

Conclusion: DexImit bridges the gap between humans and dexterous robotic hands, enabling scalable robot learning from large-scale human manipulation video datasets.

Abstract: Data scarcity fundamentally limits the generalization of bimanual dexterous manipulation, as real-world data collection for dexterous hands is expensive and labor-intensive. Human manipulation videos, as a direct carrier of manipulation knowledge, offer significant potential for scaling up robot learning. However, the substantial embodiment gap between human hands and robotic dexterous hands makes direct pretraining from human videos extremely challenging. To bridge this gap and unleash the potential of large-scale human manipulation video data, we propose DexImit, an automated framework that converts monocular human manipulation videos into physically plausible robot data, without any additional information. DexImit employs a four-stage generation pipeline: (1) reconstructing hand-object interactions from arbitrary viewpoints with near-metric scale; (2) performing subtask decomposition and bimanual scheduling; (3) synthesizing robot trajectories consistent with the demonstrated interactions; (4) comprehensive data augmentation for zero-shot real-world deployment. Building on these designs, DexImit can generate large-scale robot data based on human videos, either from the Internet or video generation models. DexImit is capable of handling diverse manipulation tasks, including tool use (e.g., cutting an apple), long-horizon tasks (e.g., making a beverage), and fine-grained manipulations (e.g., stacking cups).

TL;DR: This paper introduces EgoHumanoid, a framework enabling humanoid robots to perform loco-manipulation tasks in diverse environments using abundant egocentric human demonstrations combined with limited robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and data demand for humanoid loco-manipulation by leveraging the diversity and scale of human demonstrations.

Method: Developed a systematic alignment pipeline including view and action alignment to bridge human-robot differences. Created scalable human data collection protocols and a portable system.

Result: EgoHumanoid demonstrated a 51% improvement in performance over robot-only baselines, especially in unseen environments.

Conclusion: Incorporating egocentric human demonstration data significantly enhances humanoid loco-manipulation, and the approach highlights effective behaviors and the scalability of human data for robotic tasks.

Abstract: Human demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ST4VLA, a framework for improving vision-language models in robotic tasks by emphasizing spatial grounding and action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle to transform multimodal understanding into effective motor actions for embodied tasks.

Method: ST4VLA uses a dual-system framework with spatial grounding pre-training and spatially guided action post-training to align spatial priors with action learning.

Result: The framework significantly improves performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results in robot benchmarks and better generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: Scalable spatially guided training is a promising approach for robust and generalizable robot learning.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but fall short when extended to embodied tasks, where instructions must be transformed into low-level motor actions. We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

*Yunfan Ren,Zhiyuan Zhu,Jiaxu Xing,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learning-based controllers for quadrotor flight suffer challenges in adapting to uncertainties. This paper proposes a self-adaptive framework using Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) and Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) for real-time adaptation. Results demonstrate improved flight performance and agility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional learning-based quadrotor controllers rely on precise modeling and offline Sim2Real transfer but struggle with adaptation to external/internal uncertainties, restricting their agility and safety.

Method: The authors propose a self-adaptive framework using ATS for active physical limit exploration and online residual learning coupled with RASH-BPTT to enable efficient in-flight policy updates.

Result: The quadrotor achieves significant performance improvement, evolving from a conservative base policy maximum speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within 100 seconds of flight time.

Conclusion: Real-world adaptation is crucial for sustained performance improvement and agility in aggressive quadrotor flight scenarios, mitigating the challenges of precise modeling requirements.

Abstract: Learning-based controllers have achieved impressive performance in agile quadrotor flight but typically rely on massive training in simulation, necessitating accurate system identification for effective Sim2Real transfer. However, even with precise modeling, fixed policies remain susceptible to out-of-distribution scenarios, ranging from external aerodynamic disturbances to internal hardware degradation. To ensure safety under these evolving uncertainties, such controllers are forced to operate with conservative safety margins, inherently constraining their agility outside of controlled settings. While online adaptation offers a potential remedy, safely exploring physical limits remains a critical bottleneck due to data scarcity and safety risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-adaptive framework that eliminates the need for precise system identification or offline Sim2Real transfer. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) to actively explore platform physical limits, and employ online residual learning to augment a simple nominal model. {Based on the learned hybrid model, we further propose Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) to achieve efficient and robust in-flight policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our quadrotor reliably executes agile maneuvers near actuator saturation limits. The system evolves a conservative base policy with a peak speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within approximately 100 seconds of flight time. These findings underscore that real-world adaptation serves not merely to compensate for modeling errors, but as a practical mechanism for sustained performance improvement in aggressive flight regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOTA sampling-based motion planning algorithms using GPUs work well for high DOF arms but scale poorly when controlling multiple arms jointly.

Method: The authors extend the STORM algorithm to handle dynamic obstacles and distributed arm control by letting each arm compute its motion plan prefix, treating others as dynamic obstacles, and introducing a dynamic priority scheme.

Result: MR-STORM achieves better performance than SOTA algorithms in environments with both static and dynamic obstacles.

Conclusion: The proposed MR-STORM algorithm effectively handles distributed multi-robot planning with dynamic obstacle management, showcasing its superiority in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in sampling-based motion planning algorithms for high DOF arms leverage GPUs to provide SOTA performance. These algorithms can be used to control multiple arms jointly, but this approach scales poorly. To address this, we extend STORM, a sampling-based model-predictive-control (MPC) motion planning algorithm, to handle multiple robots in a distributed fashion. First, we modify STORM to handle dynamic obstacles. Then, we let each arm compute its own motion plan prefix, which it shares with the other arms, which treat it as a dynamic obstacle. Finally, we add a dynamic priority scheme. The new algorithm, MR-STORM, demonstrates clear empirical advantages over SOTA algorithms when operating with both static and dynamic obstacles.

TL;DR: This paper proposes "RuleFlow," a novel framework that combines program-specific optimization discovery through LLMs, generalization into rewrite rules, and deployment into a compiler to optimize Pandas programs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing Pandas programs remains difficult due to the limitations of existing approaches, which are either heavyweight and constrained in optimization scope or unreliable and inefficient when relying on LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid 3-stage framework (RuleFlow). It discovers program-specific optimizations, translates them into generalized rewrite rules, and integrates them into a compiler for automated application.

Result: RuleFlow achieves a significant performance enhancement, achieving up to 4.3x speedup over Dias (compiler-based SOTA) and 1914.9x over Modin (systems-based SOTA) on PandasBench.

Conclusion: RuleFlow sets the new SOTA for Pandas program optimization by providing an efficient and reliable framework, overcoming challenges like heavyweight systems, limited optimizations, and unreliable LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Optimizing Pandas programs is a challenging problem. Existing systems and compiler-based approaches offer reliability but are either heavyweight or support only a limited set of optimizations. Conversely, using LLMs in a per-program optimization methodology can synthesize nontrivial optimizations, but is unreliable, expensive, and offers a low yield. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach that works in a 3-stage manner that decouples discovery from deployment and connects them via a novel bridge. First, it discovers per-program optimizations (discovery). Second, they are converted into generalised rewrite rules (bridge). Finally, these rules are incorporated into a compiler that can automatically apply them wherever applicable, eliminating repeated reliance on LLMs (deployment). We demonstrate that RuleFlow is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) Pandas optimization framework on PandasBench, a challenging Pandas benchmark consisting of Python notebooks. Across these notebooks, we achieve a speedup of up to 4.3x over Dias, the previous compiler-based SOTA, and 1914.9x over Modin, the previous systems-based SOTA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that classifies open-source software (OSS) projects into lifecycle stages using multidimensional indicators for sustainability, achieving 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for a detailed understanding of OSS lifecycle trajectories and sustainability, as previous methods relied on static or aggregated metrics that lacked temporal and multidimensional insights.

Method: The authors use a hierarchical predictive framework that integrates socio-technical categorizations of OSS development with a mix of engineered indicators and 24-month activity sequences in a multi-stage classification pipeline. Explainable AI techniques are used to assess feature contribution.

Result: The approach achieves an over 94% accuracy in classifying OSS repositories into lifecycle stages and identifies contribution activity and community interaction as the dominant predictive features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust method for assessing OSS project lifecycle stages and highlights the importance of community participation and contribution patterns in sustainability analysis.

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) projects follow diverse lifecycle trajectories shaped by evolving patterns of contribution, coordination, and community engagement. Understanding these trajectories is essential for stakeholders seeking to assess project organization and health at scale. However, prior work has largely relied on static or aggregated metrics, such as project age or cumulative activity, providing limited insight into how OSS sustainability unfolds over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification. Attribution analyses consistently identify contribution activity and community-related features as dominant signals, highlighting the central role of collective participation dynamics.

TL;DR: DRAGON is a classifier for software repositories using lightweight signals to better handle missing metadata like README files, achieving higher F1@5 scores and offering robustness in large-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the classification of source code repositories, particularly in large-scale and sparse metadata settings, enabling better search and navigation in software collections.

Method: Designed DRAGON to leverage lightweight signals (file/directory names, optional README) stored in version control systems, avoiding dependence on metadata which is often unavailable.

Result: DRAGON outperformed the state-of-the-art repository classifiers by achieving F1@5 of 60.8%, even when README files were absent, with performance decreasing by only 6%.

Conclusion: DRAGON is suitable for real-world large-scale applications due to its effectiveness and robustness in processing repositories with limited metadata. Additionally, a large dataset of 825k repositories was released for future research.

Abstract: The ability to automatically classify source code repositories with ''topics'' that reflect their content and purpose is very useful, especially when navigating or searching through large software collections. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on README files and other metadata, which are frequently missing, limiting their applicability in real-world large-scale settings. We present DRAGON, a repository classifier designed for very large and diverse software collections. It operates entirely on lightweight signals commonly stored in version control systems: file and directory names, and optionally the README when available. In repository classification at scale, DRAGON improves F1@5 from 54.8% to 60.8%, surpassing the state of the art. DRAGON remains effective even when README files are absent, with performance degrading by only 6% w.r.t. when they are present. This robustness makes it practical for real-world settings where documentation is sparse or inconsistent. Furthermore, many of the remaining classification errors are near misses, where predicted labels are semantically close to the correct topics. This property increases the practical value of the predictions in real-world software collections, where suggesting a few related topics can still guide search and discovery. As a byproduct of developing DRAGON, we also release the largest open dataset to date for repository classification, consisting of 825 thousand repositories with associated ground-truth topics, sourced from the Software Heritage archive, providing a foundation for future large-scale and language-agnostic research on software repository understanding.

### [300] [Towards an OSF-based Registered Report Template for Software Engineering Controlled Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09292)
*Ana B. M. Bett,Thais S. Nepomuceno,Edson OliveiraJr,Maria Teresa Baldassarre,Valdemar V. Graciano Neto,Marcos Kalinowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the creation of a Registered Reports (RR) template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using Open Science Framework (OSF), highlighting current limitations in rigor and suggesting the establishment of RR-specific guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address reproducibility and transparency issues in Software Engineering experiments due to the lack of rigor in documenting controlled experiments.

Method: The authors analyzed existing OSF RR templates in reference to documentation guidelines for controlled experiments.

Result: The analysis revealed that none of the existing RR templates comprehensively align with the guidelines, and customization options are limited.

Conclusion: While progress in empirical software engineering exists, planning and documenting experiments lack sufficient rigor. Adopting OSF-based RRs requires additional RR-specific guidelines for Software Engineering to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Context: The empirical software engineering (ESE) community has contributed to improving experimentation over the years. However, there is still a lack of rigor in describing controlled experiments, hindering reproducibility and transparency. Registered Reports (RR) have been discussed in the ESE community to address these issues. A RR registers a study's hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses before execution, involving peer review and potential acceptance before data collection. This helps mitigate problematic practices such as p-hacking, publication bias, and inappropriate post hoc analysis. Objective: This paper presents initial results toward establishing an RR template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Method: We analyzed templates of selected OSF RR types in light of documentation guidelines for controlled experiments. Results: The observed lack of rigor motivated our investigation of OSF-based RR types. Our analysis showed that, although one of the RR types aligned with many of the documentation suggestions contained in the guidelines, none of them covered the guidelines comprehensively. The study also highlights limitations in OSF RR template customization. Conclusion: Despite progress in ESE, planning and documenting experiments still lack rigor, compromising reproducibility. Adopting OSF-based RRs is proposed. However, no currently available RR type fully satisfies the guidelines. Establishing RR-specific guidelines for SE is deemed essential.

### [301] [Cross-Project Flakiness: A Case Study of the OpenStack Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09311)
*Tao Xiao,Dong Wang,Shane McIntosh,Hideaki Hata,Yasutaka Kamei*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies test flakiness in the OpenStack ecosystem, revealing cross-project and inconsistent flaky tests that affect 55% of projects, increasing costs and review time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the broader ecosystem-wide impact of test flakiness and understand its implications on CI performance and developer trust.

Method: Empirical study conducted on 649 OpenStack projects, analyzing test outcomes and factors causing flakiness through quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Result: Identified 1,535 cross-project flaky tests and 1,105 inconsistently flaky tests, finding that 55% of projects are affected, with race conditions, configuration mismatches, and dependency issues as key causes.

Conclusion: Ecosystem-wide coordination, standardized CI configurations, and improved test isolation strategies are necessary to address flakiness and its impact on software development.

Abstract: Automated regression testing is a cornerstone of modern software development, often contributing directly to code review and Continuous Integration (CI). Yet some tests suffer from flakiness, where their outcomes vary non-deterministically. Flakiness erodes developer trust in test results, wastes computational resources, and undermines CI reliability. While prior research has examined test flakiness within individual projects, its broader ecosystem-wide impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present an empirical study of test flakiness in the OpenStack ecosystem, which focuses on (1) cross-project flakiness, where flaky tests impact multiple projects, and (2) inconsistent flakiness, where a test exhibits flakiness in some projects but remains stable in others. By analyzing 649 OpenStack projects, we identify 1,535 cross-project flaky tests and 1,105 inconsistently flaky tests. We find that cross-project flakiness affects 55% of OpenStack projects and significantly increases both review time and computational costs. Surprisingly, 70% of unit tests exhibit cross-project flakiness, challenging the assumption that unit tests are inherently insulated from issues that span modules like integration and system-level tests. Through qualitative analysis, we observe that race conditions in CI, inconsistent build configurations, and dependency mismatches are the primary causes of inconsistent flakiness. These findings underline the need for better coordination across complex ecosystems, standardized CI configurations, and improved test isolation strategies.

### [302] [SWE-AGI: Benchmarking Specification-Driven Software Construction with MoonBit in the Era of Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09447)
*Zhirui Zhang,Hongbo Zhang,Haoxiang Fei,Zhiyuan Bao,Yubin Chen,Zhengyu Lei,Ziyue Liu,Yixuan Sun,Mingkun Xiao,Zihang Ye,Yu Zhang,Hongcheng Zhu,Yuxiang Wen,Heung-Yeung Shum*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-AGI, a benchmark for testing large language models (LLMs) in autonomously building production-scale software from specifications. Results show progress in capability but highlight challenges as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of LLMs autonomously creating production-scale software from explicit specifications, which remains an unresolved challenge.

Method: SWE-AGI tasks test LLMs in developing software systems from authoritative standards using MoonBit. Tasks require extensive coding, architectural reasoning, and involve 1,000-10,000 lines of implementation.

Result: The gpt-5.3-codex model achieved the best performance (86.4% tasks solved), exceeding other LLMs. Performance declines significantly on complex tasks, and reading code emerged as a major bottleneck as projects scale.

Conclusion: LLMs are making strides in specification-driven autonomous software engineering, but challenges in scalability and complexity need further advancement before production-grade reliability.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive coding capabilities, their ability to autonomously build production-scale software from explicit specifications remains an open question. We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development.

### [303] [AlgoVeri: An Aligned Benchmark for Verified Code Generation on Classical Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09464)
*Haoyu Zhao,Ziran Yang,Jiawei Li,Deyuan He,Zenan Li,Chi Jin,Venugopal V. Veeravalli,Aarti Gupta,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AlgoVeri is a benchmarking tool that evaluates formal code verification for 77 algorithms across Dafny, Verus, and Lean, exposing gaps in AI model capabilities and providing comparative insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of standardized benchmarking methodology for evaluating AI models in formal code verification across different programming paradigms.

Method: AlgoVeri evaluates AI models by enforcing identical functional contracts across Dafny, Verus, and Lean, and examines aggregate performance metrics, test-time compute dynamics, and error trajectories.

Result: AlgoVeri highlights critical capability gaps: AI models achieve higher success rates in Dafny (40.3%) compared to Verus (24.7%) and Lean (7.8%). The benchmarking reveals distinct challenges in syntax and semantics across languages.

Conclusion: The study concludes that language design plays a significant role in determining refinement trajectories, influencing the verification success of AI models, and AlgoVeri serves as a tool to systematically evaluate these capabilities.

Abstract: Vericoding refers to the generation of formally verified code from rigorous specifications. Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

### [304] [Toward Linking Declined Proposals and Source Code: An Exploratory Study on the Go Repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09467)
*Sota Nakashima,Masanari Kondo,Mahmoud Alfadel,Aly Ahmad,Toshihiro Nakae,Hidenori Matsuzaki*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores traceability links in open-source software, focusing on declined contributions and establishing links between declined proposals and source code using an LLM-driven pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge from declined software contributions, which contain insights into decision-making criteria in OSS projects.

Method: An LLM-driven pipeline is proposed to establish traceability links between declined proposals (GitHub issues) and related source code in the Go repository. Empirical analysis and failure assessment are conducted.

Result: The pipeline achieved an accuracy of 0.836 in selecting appropriate granularity for declined proposals and a mean precision of 0.643 in generating links.

Conclusion: Investigating declined proposals reveals challenges in traceability link generation, primarily due to redundant discussions and lack of concrete implementation information.

Abstract: Traceability links are key information sources for software developers, connecting software artifacts (e.g., linking requirements to the corresponding source code). In open-source software (OSS) projects, such links play an important role, particularly between the contributions (e.g., GitHub issues) and the corresponding source code. Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented).

*Muxin Tian,Zhe Wang,Blair Yang,Zhenwei Tang,Kunlun Zhu,Honghua Dong,Hanchen Li,Xinni Xie,Guangjing Wang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Bench Mobile, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate coding agents on real-world mobile app development tasks. Current agents achieved only a 12% success rate, highlighting a significant gap in meeting industrial standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models can handle complex, realistic software engineering tasks and help close the gap between their current capabilities and industry requirements.

Method: The authors used the SWE-Bench Mobile benchmark, derived from a production iOS codebase, featuring multi-modal inputs, mixed Swift/Objective-C code, and thorough test suites. They evaluated 22 configurations across four coding agents.

Result: Agents achieved a maximum of a 12% task success rate, revealing a dependency on agent design and model capability. Commercial agents outperformed open-source ones, and simpler prompts led to better performance by 7.4%.

Conclusion: Current large language model agents are far from meeting industry standards for mobile app development, but SWE-Bench Mobile offers insights and a structured way to evaluate and improve agent capabilities for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Can large language model agents develop industry-level mobile applications? We introduce \textbf{SWE-Bench Mobile}, a benchmark for evaluating coding agents on realistic software engineering tasks derived from a production iOS codebase. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated problems or bug fixes, SWE-Bench Mobile captures the full complexity of industrial development: multi-modal inputs (PRDs and Figma designs), a large-scale mixed Swift/Objective-C codebase, and comprehensive test suites. We evaluate 22 agent-model configurations across four coding agents -- three commercial (Cursor, Codex, Claude Code) and one open-source (OpenCode) -- and find that even the best configurations achieve only 12\% task success rate. Our analysis reveals that (1) agent design matters as much as model capability -- the same model shows up to 6$\times$ performance gap across agents, (2) commercial agents consistently outperform open-source alternatives, and (3) simple ``Defensive Programming'' prompts outperform complex ones by 7.4\%. These findings highlight a significant gap between current agent capabilities and industrial requirements, while providing actionable insights for practitioners and researchers. We release SWE-Bench Mobile as a \textit{hosted benchmark challenge} to prevent data contamination and ensure fair evaluation. The public leaderboard and development toolkit are available at https://swebenchmobile.com.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ScaleSWE, an automated system to create a large-scale, high-quality software engineering (SWE) dataset by processing millions of pull requests, resulting in 100k verified SWE instances, the largest dataset of its kind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, large-scale training datasets poses a bottleneck in mastering real-world software engineering tasks, limiting the potential of automated tools.

Method: The authors designed ScaleSWE, a sandboxed multi-agent workflow with three specialized agents focusing on environment setup, test creation, and problem description synthesis. This system processed 6 million pull requests across 5200 repositories to create the dataset.

Result: ScaleSWE produced 100k verified SWE instances, surpassing existing datasets in repository diversity and task complexity. The dataset was used to train and fine-tune Qwen30BA3BInstruct, achieving remarkable performance gains.

Conclusion: ScaleSWE provides a scalable and reproducible way to construct quality data for advancing large language model-based software engineering tools, and the dataset will be publicly released to benefit the broader community.

Abstract: Achieving mastery in real world software engineering tasks is fundamentally bottlenecked by the scarcity of large scale, high quality training data. Scaling such data has been limited by the complexity of environment setup, unit test generation, and problem statement curation. In this paper, we propose ScaleSWE, an automated, sandboxed multi agent workflow designed to construct high quality SWE data at scale. The system coordinates three specialized agents for environment setup, test creation, and problem description synthesis to process 6 million pull requests across 5200 repositories, producing Scale SWE Data: 100k verified SWE instances, the largest such dataset to date. It substantially surpasses existing real world datasets in repository diversity and reflects realistic task complexity. We further demonstrate the dataset utility for training by distilling 71498 high quality trajectories and finetuning Qwen30BA3BInstruct to produce ScaleSWE Agent. Our agent achieves a 64 resolve rate on SWE Bench Verified a nearly three fold improvement over the base model. ScaleSWE provides a scalable, reproducible approach for data construction to advance LLM based software engineering. Scale SWE will be publicly available.

*Everaldo Silva Júnior,Lina Marsso,Ricardo Caldas,Marsha Chechik,Genaína Nunes Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a requirements engineering approach for ethics-aware autonomous systems, integrating human values with functional goals to resolve ethical conflicts early in the design phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human values are ambiguous and context-dependent, making their integration into autonomous systems challenging. The paper addresses the need for explicit representation of values for conflict resolution.

Method: Values are represented as normative goals, systematically transformed into SLEEC requirements (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, Cultural). Automated tools check well-formedness, detect conflicts, and negotiate value trade-offs.

Result: The proposed approach was successfully demonstrated via a medical Body Sensor Network case study, showing its practical feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach enables operationalizing human values alongside functional requirements, fostering early conflict detection and resolution in autonomous system design.

Abstract: Operationalizing human values alongside functional and adaptation requirements remains challenging due to their ambiguous, pluralistic, and context-dependent nature. Explicit representations are needed to support the elicitation, analysis, and negotiation of value conflicts beyond traditional software engineering abstractions. In this work, we propose a requirements engineering approach for ethics-aware autonomous systems that captures human values as normative goals and aligns them with functional and adaptation goals. These goals are systematically operationalized into Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural (SLEEC) requirements, enabling automated well-formedness checking, conflict detection, and early design-time negotiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach through a medical Body Sensor Network case study.

### [309] [JMigBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Source Code Migration (Java 8 to Java 11)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09930)
*Nishil Amin,Zhiwei Fei,Xiang Li,Justyna Petke,He Ye*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper builds a benchmark (JMigBench) to evaluate large language models' ability to migrate Java 8 code to Java 11, revealing moderate success but limitations in complex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in automating source code migration, particularly between Java 8 and Java 11, as a means to reduce developer effort.

Method: Constructed a refined dataset covering eight categories of deprecated APIs and evaluated the Mistral Codestral model using CodeBLEU and keyword-based metrics.

Result: The Mistral Codestral model succeeded in trivial API migrations (11.11% identical migrations) but struggled with complex migrations involving CORBA or JAX-WS.

Conclusion: While partially effective in reducing developer effort, Mistral Codestral is not yet capable of fully automating migration tasks; further improvements in datasets and LLMs are needed.

Abstract: We build a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for source code migration tasks, specifically upgrading functions from Java 8 to Java 11. We first collected a dataset of function pairs from open-source repositories, but limitations in data quality led us to construct a refined dataset covering eight categories of deprecated APIs. Using this dataset, the Mistral Codestral model was evaluated with CodeBLEU and keyword-based metrics to measure lexical and semantic similarity as well as migration correctness. Results show that the evaluated model (Mistral Codestral) can handle trivial one-to-one API substitutions with moderate success, achieving identical migrations in 11.11% of the cases, but it struggles with more complex migrations such as CORBA or JAX-WS. These findings suggest Mistral Codestral can partially reduce developer effort by automating repetitive migration tasks but cannot yet replace humans within the scope of the JMigBench benchmark. The benchmark and analysis provide a foundation for future work on expanding datasets, refining prompting strategies, and improving migration performance across different LLMs.

*Junjie Luo,Shangzhou Xia,Fuyuan Zhang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum EMI (QEMI), a novel technique for testing quantum software stacks by identifying bugs through semantic-preserving transformations. It detected 11 crash bugs and 1 behavioral inconsistency in major quantum platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable testing of quantum software stacks has become critical due to the lack of a reliable ground truth for program behavior. Existing approaches are inadequate for addressing the challenges posed by quantum programs.

Method: The authors propose Quantum EMI (QEMI), utilizing a random quantum program generator to create quantum code with dead code and adapt EMI techniques from classical testing by removing the dead code to produce variants. By comparing the behavior of these variants, potential bugs were detected.

Result: QEMI was applied to Qiskit, Q#, and Cirq, uncovering 11 crash bugs and 1 behavioral inconsistency, demonstrating its effectiveness as a quantum software testing tool.

Conclusion: QEMI introduces a novel, semantics-preserving approach to testing quantum software stacks, broadening the range of available testing techniques and improving reliability and correctness in quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: As quantum algorithms and hardware continue to evolve, ensuring the correctness of the quantum software stack (QSS) has become increasingly important. However, testing QSSes remains challenging due to the oracle problem, i.e., the lack of a reliable ground truth for expected program behavior. Existing metamorphic testing approaches often rely on equivalent circuit transformations, backend modifications, or parameter tuning to address this issue. In this work, inspired by Equivalence Modulo Inputs (EMI), we propose Quantum EMI (QEMI), a new testing approach for QSSes. Our key contributions include: (1) a random quantum program generator that produces code with dead code based on quantum control-flow structures, and (2) an adaptation of the EMI technique from classical compiler testing to generate variants by removing dead code. By comparing the behavior of these variants, we can detect potential bugs in QSS implementations. We applied QEMI to Qiskit, Q#, and Cirq, and successfully identified 11 crash bugs and 1 behavioral inconsistency. QEMI expands the limited set of testing techniques available for quantum software stacks by going beyond structural transformations and incorporating semantics-preserving ones into quantum program analysis.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need for automated environment interaction in code migration workflows and proposes an integrated framework to address current challenges in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software often undergoes updates to improve functionality, but code and its environment are closely linked. Ignoring the environment in migration processes leads to inefficiencies and project delays.

Method: The authors review the current state of automated environment construction and propose a new framework paradigm that integrates environment setup with code migration workflows.

Result: The paper highlights the significant gap in automated code migration processes due to the lack of environment interaction and proposes a novel framework to address it.

Conclusion: Automation of code migration is incomplete without addressing environment interaction. Adopting an integrated approach can enhance software evolution processes and efficiency.

Abstract: Modern software systems continuously undergo code upgrades to enhance functionality, security, and performance, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code migration tasks. However, while research on automated code migration which including refactoring, API adaptation, and dependency updates has advanced rapidly, the exploration of the automated environment interaction that must accompany it remains relatively scarce. In practice, code and its environment are intricately intertwined. Relying solely on static analysis of the environment leads to an inadequate understanding of the target setting, prolongs feedback cycles, and consequently causes significant rework and project delays, thereby reducing overall efficiency. We contend that successful software evolution demands a holistic perspective that integrates both code and environment migration. To understand the current landscape and challenges, we first provide an overview of the status of automated environment construction. We then propose a novel framework paradigm that tightly integrates automated environment setup with the code migration workflow. Finally, we explore the challenges and future directions for automated environment interaction within the code migration domain. Our findings emphasize that without automated environment interaction, the automation of code migration is only half complete.

### [312] [Artisan: Agentic Artifact Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10046)
*Doehyun Baek,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The abstract discusses "Artisan," an automated large language model (LLM) agent designed to make artifact evaluation in software engineering more efficient. It evaluates research reproducibility by generating reproduction scripts that execute independently and are guided by automated judging to ensure integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducing research results in software engineering is currently a manual, labor-intensive process, limiting its execution to select papers. The motivation is to automate and scale this task to ensure reproducibility efficiently.

Method: Artisan frames the reproduction task as code generation, creating reproducible scripts for research results. It incorporates automated judging to guide agents towards valid outputs while preventing trivial solutions. A benchmark named Artisan-Bench evaluates Artisan against various tasks.

Result: Artisan generated reproduction scripts for 44 out of 60 tasks, outperforming a baseline agent by 3.14x in this regard. It identified 20 errors in papers or artifacts.

Conclusion: Artisan is an effective tool that automates artifact evaluation and reproducibility assessments in software engineering, significantly improving efficiency and highlighting previously undiscovered issues.

Abstract: Artifact evaluation has become standard practice in the software engineering community to ensure the reproducibility of research results. However, the current manual process is labor-intensive, and hence, done only as a one-time assessment for a subset of all papers. To support the artifact evaluation effort, we present Artisan, an automated LLM agent for reproducing research results given a paper and its artifact. The approach is enabled by two key contributions: First, we frame the reproduction problem as a code generation task where the goal is to generate a reproduction script that, when executed, reproduces the results reported in a paper. Unlike prior work on automatically reproducing research results in other domains, this formulation allows for running the script independently of the agent and for assessing the reproduction process at a fine-grained level. Second, we design automated judging mechanism that guides the agent toward the expected results without revealing them and that prevent trivial solutions, such as simply copying checked-in results. To evaluate Artisan, we introduce Artisan-Bench, the first benchmark assessing the ability to generate reproduction scripts and the first benchmark for automated artifact evaluation in software engineering. Artisan-Bench comprises 60 tasks derived from 23 software engineering papers, covering different research areas and programming languages. We validate all tasks in Artisan-Bench for reproducibility to ensure that the tasks are feasible. Our experiments show that Artisan is effective, producing 44/60 reproduction scripts and outperforming the best available baseline, a vanilla LLM agent (mini-swe-agent), by 3.14$\times$ in terms of reproduction scripts generated while taking $0.45 and 48 minutes, on average per task. Artisan also helped uncover 20 new errors in either the paper or artifact.

*Sangyoon Bae,Miruna Oprescu,David Keetae Park,Shinjae Yoo,Jiook Cha*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of deriving directed neural connectivity from neuroimaging by introducing INCAMA, a causal discovery method separating true neural dynamics from observational artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuroimaging measurements are distorted by hemodynamic filtering and volume conduction, leading to spurious causal graphs. There is a need for methods that separate true neural interactions from these observational artifacts.

Method: The authors present INCAMA, a latent-space causal discovery framework combining a physics-aware inversion module with nonstationarity-driven, delay-sensitive causal discovery using selective state-space sequences. They validate its approach through biophysical simulations and fMRI applications.

Result: INCAMA significantly outperforms standard methods on EEG and fMRI simulations. It also showcases zero-shot generalization on real-world fMRI data, recovering true visuo-motor pathways consistent with known neuroanatomy.

Conclusion: INCAMA provides an effective solution for identifying directed neural connectivity while accounting for observation artifacts, making it suitable for whole-brain causal inference in neuroimaging.

Abstract: Inferring directed connectivity from neuroimaging is an ill-posed inverse problem: recorded signals are distorted by hemodynamic filtering and volume conduction, which can mask true neural interactions. Many existing methods conflate these observation artifacts with genuine neural influence, risking spurious causal graphs driven by the measurement process. We introduce INCAMA (INdirect CAusal MAmba), a latent-space causal discovery framework that explicitly accounts for measurement physics to separate neural dynamics from indirect observations. INCAMA integrates a physics-aware inversion module with a nonstationarity-driven, delay-sensitive causal discovery model based on selective state-space sequences. Leveraging nonstationary mechanism shifts as soft interventions, we establish identifiability of delayed causal structure from indirect measurements and a stability bound that quantifies how inversion error affects graph recovery. We validate INCAMA on large-scale biophysical simulations across EEG and fMRI, where it significantly outperforms standard pipelines. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to real-world fMRI from the Human Connectome Project: without domain-specific fine-tuning, INCAMA recovers canonical visuo-motor pathways (e.g., $V1 \to V2$ and $M1 \leftrightarrow S1$) consistent with established neuroanatomy, supporting its use for whole-brain causal inference.

*Peter N. Taylor,Gerard Hall,Jonathan Horsley,Yujiang Wang,Sjoerd B. Vos,Gavin P Winston,Andrew W McEvoy,Anna Miserocchi,Jane de Tisi,John S Duncan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper releases a new dataset, IDEAS II, with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) data from 216 epilepsy patients and 98 healthy controls, aiming to advance research on cerebral networks underlying epilepsy and surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DWI data, which is crucial for understanding epileptic brain networks, is scarce and technically challenging due to artifacts and scan-specific issues. This work seeks to address this by creating a large and accessible dataset.

Method: Raw DWI data were preprocessed to reduce distortions/artifacts and processed into maps and connectivity measures. Structural connectomes were created using multiple atlases and measures, with the data tied to existing T1, FLAIR, surgical, and long-term outcomes from previous IDEAS datasets.

Result: Replication of the ENIGMA study showed significant reductions in fractional anisotropy in regions linked to seizure onset, validating the dataset. Localized abnormalities and network connectivity were demonstrated using streamline tractography from a case study.

Conclusion: This open dataset, IDEAS II, is a significant resource for studying structural brain connectivity, advancing research on epilepsy, and informing surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Epileptic seizures are generated in cerebral networks that propagate ictal and interictal activity. The structure of cerebral networks underpinning epileptic activity can be inferred from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). However, publicly available DWI data in individuals with epilepsy are scarce, and processing is technically challenging due to scan-specific artifacts, limiting research progress. Here, we release raw DWI data from 216 individuals with epilepsy and 98 healthy controls. Subject identifiers align with our previous data release (IDEAS), which includes T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI, surgical details, and long-term seizure outcomes after surgery. Preprocessing reduced distortions and artifacts, while fully processed data include diffusion metric maps in native and template space. We also provide parcellated structural connectomes using multiple atlases and connectivity measures. To illustrate the utility of this IDEAS II data, we replicated ENIGMA consortium findings, observing widespread reductions of fractional anisotropy, particularly ipsilateral to the area of seizure onset. We further demonstrate localised abnormality, and network connectivity using streamline tractography in a patient who subsequently underwent temporal lobe resection. This open dataset offers a comprehensive resource to advance research on structural connectivity and surgical outcomes in epilepsy.

### [315] [Persistent Entropy as a Detector of Phase Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09058)
*Matteo Rucco*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework explaining how persistent entropy detects phase transitions, validated through various experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical model-independent understanding of why persistent entropy reliably detects regime changes in complex systems.

Method: The study establishes a theorem ensuring persistent entropy separates phases, introduces topological stabilization for finite observation, and validates using empirical datasets and experiments.

Result: Persistent entropy showed consistent separation across phases and experimental scenarios, supporting its theoretical and numerical reliability.

Conclusion: Persistent Entropy is robust in detecting regime changes, both theoretically validated and empirically applied across diverse systems.

Abstract: Persistent entropy (PE) is an information-theoretic summary statistic of persistence barcodes that has been widely used to detect regime changes in complex systems. Despite its empirical success, a general theoretical understanding of when and why persistent entropy reliably detects phase transitions has remained limited, particularly in stochastic and data-driven settings. In this work, we establish a general, model-independent theorem providing sufficient conditions under which persistent entropy provably separates two phases. We show that persistent entropy exhibits an asymptotically non-vanishing gap across phases. The result relies only on continuity of persistent entropy along the convergent diagram sequence, or under mild regularization, and is therefore broadly applicable across data modalities, filtrations, and homological degrees. To connect asymptotic theory with finite-time computations, we introduce an operational framework based on topological stabilization, defining a topological transition time by stabilizing a chosen topological statistic over sliding windows, and a probability-based estimator of critical parameters within a finite observation horizon. We validate the framework on the Kuramoto synchronization transition, the Vicsek order-to-disorder transition in collective motion, and neural network training dynamics across multiple datasets and architectures. Across all experiments, stabilization of persistent entropy and collapse of variability across realizations provide robust numerical signatures consistent with the theoretical mechanism.

### [316] [Minimum Distance Summaries for Robust Neural Posterior Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09161)
*Sherman Khoo,Dennis Prangle,Song Liu,Mark Beaumont*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust plug-in method for simulation-based inference (SBI) using minimum-distance summaries, enhancing performance when test observations deviate from training data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the susceptibility of neural posterior estimators (NPEs) to misspecifications caused by deviations between test observations and training distribution.

Method: Leverage maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and random Fourier feature approximations to adapt test-time summaries independently of pretrained NPEs for robust inference.

Result: The proposed method shows substantial robustness improvements with minimal computational overhead in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Minimum-distance summaries provide a lightweight and effective solution to improve robustness in SBI without compromising modularity or amortization.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables amortized Bayesian inference by first training a neural posterior estimator (NPE) on prior-simulator pairs, typically through low-dimensional summary statistics, which can then be cheaply reused for fast inference by querying it on new test observations. Because NPE is estimated under the training data distribution, it is susceptible to misspecification when observations deviate from the training distribution. Many robust SBI approaches address this by modifying NPE training or introducing error models, coupling robustness to the inference network and compromising amortization and modularity. We introduce minimum-distance summaries, a plug-in robust NPE method that adapts queried test-time summaries independently of the pretrained NPE. Leveraging the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a distance between observed data and a summary-conditional predictive distribution, the adapted summary inherits strong robustness properties from the MMD. We demonstrate that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently with random Fourier feature approximations, yielding a lightweight, model-free test-time adaptation procedure. We provide theoretical guarantees for the robustness of our algorithm and empirically evaluate it on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating substantial robustness gains with minimal additional overhead.

### [317] [Quantifying Epistemic Uncertainty in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09170)
*Aditi Gupta,Raphael A. Meyer,Yotam Yaniv,Elynn Chen,N. Benjamin Erichson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLARE, a method to estimate epistemic uncertainty for diffusion models using Fisher information. It aims to separate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, improving reliability in synthetic time-series generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion models are unreliable as they conflate it with aleatoric uncertainty, necessitating a more precise approach.

Method: The researchers propose FLARE, which uses a randomized subset of model parameters to approximate Fisher information, effectively isolating epistemic uncertainty. This method is computationally scalable.

Result: FLARE demonstrates superior reliability and accuracy in uncertainty estimation for synthetic time-series tasks compared to existing methods. The study also shows that last-layer Laplace approximations are inadequate for this purpose.

Conclusion: FLARE is a robust approach to epistemic uncertainty estimation, improving the accuracy and reliability of uncertainty quantification in diffusion models. Its scalability and theoretical foundations make it a valuable contribution to uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: To ensure high quality outputs, it is important to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of diffusion models.Existing methods are often unreliable because they mix epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. We introduce a method based on Fisher information that explicitly isolates epistemic variance, producing more reliable plausibility scores for generated data. To make this approach scalable, we propose FLARE (Fisher-Laplace Randomized Estimator), which approximates the Fisher information using a uniformly random subset of model parameters. Empirically, FLARE improves uncertainty estimation in synthetic time-series generation tasks, achieving more accurate and reliable filtering than other methods. Theoretically, we bound the convergence rate of our randomized approximation and provide analytic and empirical evidence that last-layer Laplace approximations are insufficient for this task.

### [318] [Mutual Information Collapse Explains Disentanglement Failure in $β$-VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09277)
*Minh Vu,Xiaoliang Wan,Shuangqing Wei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses $β$-VAE's disentanglement limitations, introduces $λβ$-VAE to counteract informational collapse, and demonstrates effectiveness with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of $β$-VAE in disentanglement due to excessive regularization that leads to informational collapse and reduced latent informativeness.

Method: Introduces $λβ$-VAE, employing an auxiliary $L_2$ reconstruction penalty $λ$ to decouple regularization from informational collapse.

Result: Finds that $λ> 0$ stabilizes disentanglement and maintains latent informativeness across a broader range of $β$, with empirical validation using datasets like dSprites, Shapes3D, and MPI3D-real.

Conclusion: $λβ$-VAE resolves fundamental issues in $β$-VAE, stabilizing latent informativeness and providing theoretical guidelines for more robust variational inference.

Abstract: The $β$-VAE is a foundational framework for unsupervised disentanglement, using $β$ to regulate the trade-off between latent factorization and reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, however, disentanglement performance exhibits a pervasive non-monotonic trend: benchmarks such as MIG and SAP typically peak at intermediate $β$ and collapse as regularization increases. We demonstrate that this collapse is a fundamental information-theoretic failure, where strong Kullback-Leibler pressure promotes marginal independence at the expense of the latent channel's semantic informativeness. By formalizing this mechanism in a linear-Gaussian setting, we prove that for $β> 1$, stationarity-induced dynamics trigger a spectral contraction of the encoder gain, driving latent-factor mutual information to zero. To resolve this, we introduce the $λβ$-VAE, which decouples regularization pressure from informational collapse via an auxiliary $L_2$ reconstruction penalty $λ$. Extensive experiments on dSprites, Shapes3D, and MPI3D-real confirm that $λ> 0$ stabilizes disentanglement and restores latent informativeness over a significantly broader range of $β$, providing a principled theoretical justification for dual-parameter regularization in variational inference backbones.

### [319] [The Critical Horizon: Inspection Design Principles for Multi-Stage Operations and Deep Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09394)
*Seyed Morteza Emadi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of attributing a terminal outcome to intermediate stages at earlier points, introducing a theoretical barrier where signal decay limits learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the shared challenge across fields—manufacturing, service, supply chains, AI reasoning—of understanding how intermediate steps influence outcomes. Proper credit assignment improves operational and AI decision-making.

Method: The authors apply information theory to prove bounds and establish analytical principles that quantify the impact of signal decay, define sample complexity, explore checkpoint spacing, and analyze rollouts.

Result: The paper establishes four key results: signal decay bounds sample complexity, limited benefit from parallel rollouts, optimization mismatches under additive rewards, and optimal inspection designs under different conditions.

Conclusion: Credit assignment in sequential processes faces fundamental information-theoretic limits, and analytic foundations proposed here guide better operational inspection and AI supervision strategies.

Abstract: Manufacturing lines, service journeys, supply chains, and AI reasoning chains share a common challenge: attributing a terminal outcome to the intermediate stage that caused it. We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which no algorithm can learn from endpoint data alone. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct. Fourth, Optimal Inspection Design: uniform checkpoint spacing is minimax-optimal under homogeneous signal attenuation, while a greedy algorithm yields optimal non-uniform schedules under heterogeneous attenuation. Together, these results provide a common analytical foundation for inspection design in operations and supervision design in AI.

### [320] [Is Memorization Helpful or Harmful? Prior Information Sets the Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09405)
*Chen Cheng,Rina Foygel Barber*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relationship between training error and generalization error in overparameterized linear models under Bayesian priors, identifying factors influencing optimal generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which memorization or avoiding overfitting are crucial for achieving optimal generalization in overparameterized linear models.

Method: The study employs a Bayesian framework, analyzing training and generalization errors with respect to prior distributions, noise levels, and thresholds influenced by Fisher information and variance parameters.

Result: The research reveals explicit conditions where memorization is necessary or overfitting is harmful, based on noise thresholds defined by the prior distribution's Fisher information and variance.

Conclusion: Optimal generalization behavior depends on the structure of the prior distribution and noise level thresholds, highlighting when training errors should align either near interpolation or the noise level.

Abstract: We examine the connection between training error and generalization error for arbitrary estimating procedures, working in an overparameterized linear model under general priors in a Bayesian setup. We find determining factors inherent to the prior distribution $π$, giving explicit conditions under which optimal generalization necessitates that the training error be (i) near interpolating relative to the noise size (i.e., memorization is necessary), or (ii) close to the noise level (i.e., overfitting is harmful). Remarkably, these phenomena occur when the noise reaches thresholds determined by the Fisher information and the variance parameters of the prior $π$.

### [321] [From Average Sensitivity to Small-Loss Regret Bounds under Random-Order Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09457)
*Shinsaku Sakaue,Yuichi Yoshida*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper enhances online learning methods in the random-order model, focusing on adaptive optimization for small-loss regret bounds, applicable to various problems such as clustering and regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve online learning by establishing small-loss regret bounds in the random-order model, addressing adversarially chosen loss functions with minimal assumptions.

Method: The authors extend the batch-to-online conversion method, introduce adaptive tuning of the approximation parameter, and utilize concave conjugates to derive regret bounds without requiring regularity assumptions on loss functions.

Result: The paper improves prior bounds, applies the framework to specific problems like $k$-means clustering, regression, and submodular function minimization, and achieves enhanced small-loss regret bounds using sparsification.

Conclusion: The work generalizes adaptive learning techniques, advancing small-loss regret bounds in various online learning tasks and highlighting the utility of sparsification techniques.

Abstract: We study online learning in the random-order model, where the multiset of loss functions is chosen adversarially but revealed in a uniformly random order. Building on the batch-to-online conversion by Dong and Yoshida (2023), we show that if an offline algorithm admits a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation guarantee and the effect of $\varepsilon$ on its average sensitivity is characterized by a function $\varphi(\varepsilon)$, then an adaptive choice of $\varepsilon$ yields a small-loss regret bound of $\tilde O(\varphi^{\star}(\mathrm{OPT}_T))$, where $\varphi^{\star}$ is the concave conjugate of $\varphi$, $\mathrm{OPT}_T$ is the offline optimum over $T$ rounds, and $\tilde O$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$. Our method requires no regularity assumptions on loss functions, such as smoothness, and can be viewed as a generalization of the AdaGrad-style tuning applied to the approximation parameter $\varepsilon$. Our result recovers and strengthens the $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate regret bounds of Dong and Yoshida (2023) and yields small-loss regret bounds for online $k$-means clustering, low-rank approximation, and regression. We further apply our framework to online submodular function minimization using $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-cut sparsifiers of submodular hypergraphs, obtaining a small-loss regret bound of $\tilde O(n^{3/4}(1 + \mathrm{OPT}_T^{3/4}))$, where $n$ is the ground-set size. Our approach sheds light on the power of sparsification and related techniques in establishing small-loss regret bounds in the random-order model.

*Florian Handke,Dejan Stančević,Felix Koulischer,Thomas Demeester,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper focuses on understanding how diffusion models transition semantic decisions from ambiguous states to committed ones over time, proposing entropy tracking as a reliable method to identify these transitional regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in detecting and exploiting the semantic transition periods in trained diffusion models, where semantic structure formation and class commitment occur.

Method: Introduced tracking of class-conditional entropy of latent semantic variables to identify transitions critical for semantic structure formation, validating this on Gaussian mixture models and diffusion models like EDM2-XS and Stable Diffusion 1.5.

Result: The class-conditional entropy reliably captures critical transition points in semantic structure formation in diffusion models, validated with real models for time-localized control.

Conclusion: The framework bridges information-theoretic principles and physical perspectives, offering tools for improved control over semantic information redistribution in diffusion processes.

Abstract: Diffusion models do not recover semantic structure uniformly over time. Instead, samples transition from semantic ambiguity to class commitment within a narrow regime. Recent theoretical work attributes this transition to dynamical instabilities along class-separating directions, but practical methods to detect and exploit these windows in trained models are still limited. We show that tracking the class-conditional entropy of a latent semantic variable given the noisy state provides a reliable signature of these transition regimes. By restricting the entropy to semantic partitions, the entropy can furthermore resolve semantic decisions at different levels of abstraction. We analyze this behavior in high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and show that the entropy rate concentrates on the same logarithmic time scale as the speciation symmetry-breaking instability previously identified in variance-preserving diffusion. We validate our method on EDM2-XS and Stable Diffusion 1.5, where class-conditional entropy consistently isolates the noise regimes critical for semantic structure formation. Finally, we use our framework to quantify how guidance redistributes semantic information over time. Together, these results connect information-theoretic and statistical physics perspectives on diffusion and provide a principled basis for time-localized control.

*Pablo García-Santaclara,Bruno Fernández-Castro,RebecaP. Díaz-Redondo,Martín Alonso-Gamarra*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative replay framework for online continual regression tasks, addressing the challenge of data stream adaptation without storing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments like Industry 4.0 face challenges with data streams that constantly change, making it necessary for models to adapt without costly retraining.

Method: The paper proposes a prototype-based generative replay framework with adaptive output-space discretization for continual regression, eliminating reliance on raw data storage.

Result: The framework demonstrates reduced forgetting and enhanced performance stability on benchmark datasets compared to other methods.

Conclusion: This approach advances continual learning for regression tasks, ensuring adaptability and longevity of models for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Data streams are rarely static in dynamic environments like Industry 4.0. Instead, they constantly change, making traditional offline models outdated unless they can quickly adjust to the new data. This need can be adequately addressed by continual learning (CL), which allows systems to gradually acquire knowledge without incurring the prohibitive costs of retraining them from scratch. Most research on continual learning focuses on classification problems, while very few studies address regression tasks. We propose the first prototype-based generative replay framework designed for online task-free continual regression. Our approach defines an adaptive output-space discretization model, enabling prototype-based generative replay for continual regression without storing raw data. Evidence obtained from several benchmark datasets shows that our framework reduces forgetting and provides more stable performance than other state-of-the-art solutions.

### [324] [Stabilized Maximum-Likelihood Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation for Structural CVaR under Correlated Random Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09847)
*Alireza Tabarraei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum-enhanced methodology for efficiently evaluating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) in high-dimensional problems with spatially correlated uncertainties, significantly outperforming classical Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVaR is critical for tail-risk analysis in structural mechanics, but traditional methods struggle with computational efficiency under high-dimensional, spatially correlated uncertainties.

Method: The study develops a quantum-enhanced framework leveraging Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (IQAE) and maximum-likelihood inference to evaluate CVaR with statistical confidence and computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates lower computational complexity than classical Monte Carlo methods while delivering accurate and statistically reliable CVaR estimations.

Conclusion: This research introduces a robust, theoretically sound quantum-enabled tool for tail-risk quantification in stochastic mechanics, offering scalability and accuracy advantages over classical techniques.

Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a central tail-risk measure in stochastic structural mechanics, yet its accurate evaluation under high-dimensional, spatially correlated material uncertainty remains computationally prohibitive for classical Monte Carlo methods. Leveraging bounded-expectation reformulations of CVaR compatible with quantum amplitude estimation, we develop a quantum-enhanced inference framework that casts CVaR evaluation as a statistically consistent, confidence-constrained maximum-likelihood amplitude estimation problem. The proposed method extends iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE) by embedding explicit maximum-likelihood inference within a rigorously controlled interval-tracking architecture. To ensure global correctness under finite-shot noise and the non-injective oscillatory response induced by Grover amplification, we introduce a stabilized inference scheme incorporating multi-hypothesis feasibility tracking, periodic low-depth disambiguation, and a bounded restart mechanism governed by an explicit failure-probability budget. This formulation preserves the quadratic oracle-complexity advantage of amplitude estimation while providing finite-sample confidence guarantees and reduced estimator variance. The framework is demonstrated on benchmark problems with spatially correlated lognormal Young's modulus fields generated using a Nystrom low-rank Gaussian kernel model. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves substantially lower oracle complexity than classical Monte Carlo CVaR estimation at comparable confidence levels, while maintaining rigorous statistical reliability. This work establishes a practically robust and theoretically grounded quantum-enhanced methodology for tail-risk quantification in stochastic continuum mechanics.

TL;DR: Lloyd's k-means algorithm fails in high-dimensional, high-noise settings, while Hartigan's k-means does not exhibit the same issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and empirical failures of Lloyd's k-means algorithm in high-dimensional, noisy conditions.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Lloyd's k-means and Hartigan's k-means algorithms under high-dimensional, high-noise scenarios.

Result: Lloyd's k-means algorithm results in catastrophic failure, returning its initial partition, while Hartigan's algorithm successfully avoids this problem.

Conclusion: Hartigan's k-means algorithm is more robust than Lloyd's in challenging high-dimensional clustering scenarios, offering better theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Lloyd's k-means algorithm is one of the most widely used clustering methods. We prove that in high-dimensional, high-noise settings, the algorithm exhibits catastrophic failure: with high probability, essentially every partition of the data is a fixed point. Consequently, Lloyd's algorithm simply returns its initial partition - even when the underlying clusters are trivially recoverable by other methods. In contrast, we prove that Hartigan's k-means algorithm does not exhibit this pathology. Our results show the stark difference between these algorithms and offer a theoretical explanation for the empirical difficulties often observed with k-means in high dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising sophistication of cyber threats, especially targeting critical infrastructure, necessitates robust security measures, prompting the need for ZTA.

Method: A comprehensive framework for integrating ZTA with customized approaches for organizations managing sensitive operations is developed.

Result: The ZTA framework enhances compliance, ensures continuous protection, and reduces attack surfaces in critical infrastructure environments.

Conclusion: Applying ZTA to endpoint management within cloud environments significantly strengthens security for critical infrastructure systems.

Abstract: Cyber threats have become highly sophisticated, prompting a heightened concern for endpoint security, especially in critical infrastructure, to new heights. A security model, such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), is required to overcome this challenge. ZTA treats every access request as new and assumes no implicit trust. Critical infrastructure like power plants, healthcare systems, financial systems, water supply, and military assets are especially prone to becoming targets for hackers and phishing attacks. This proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating tailored ZTA into organizations that manage sensitive operations. The paper highlights how the ZTA framework can enhance compliance, enabling continuous protection, thereby reducing attack surfaces. This paper aims to address the gap that exists in applying ZTA to endpoint management within cloud environments for critical infrastructure.

*Georgios Syros,Evan Rose,Brian Grinstead,Christoph Kerschbaumer,William Robertson,Cristina Nita-Rotaru,Alina Oprea*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MUZZLE introduces a framework for evaluating web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks, demonstrating success in discovering advanced security vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current evaluations of web agents against prompt injection attacks, which rely on fixed templates and manual processes.

Method: MUZZLE automatically identifies injection surfaces using agent trajectories and generates adaptive malicious instructions, refining attacks iteratively based on execution feedback.

Result: MUZZLE discovered 37 new attacks across 4 web applications, revealing violations of confidentiality and privacy, including cross-application and phishing attack strategies.

Conclusion: MUZZLE provides an automated and adaptive mechanism to assess web agents' security, offering minimal human intervention and a comprehensible framework for vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based web agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex online tasks by directly interacting with web sites and performing actions on users' behalf. While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario.

TL;DR: This study explores how popularity ratings impact creativity in art and science, finding that visible popularity reduces diversity and slows innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of feedback loops on collective creativity in cultural dynamics, especially in social environments influenced by popularity.

Method: Conducting a large-scale online experiment involving 1,008 participants who selected and modified images in evolving markets under popularity information conditions.

Result: Exposure to popularity ratings led to reduced cultural diversity, slower innovation, and aesthetic stagnation by altering selection and creation pathways.

Conclusion: Popularity feedback in cultural markets limits diversity and innovation, affecting both selection preferences and creative production processes.

Abstract: Real-world creative processes ranging from art to science rely on social feedback-loops between selection and creation. Yet, the effects of popularity feedback on collective creativity remain poorly understood. We investigate how popularity ratings influence cultural dynamics in a large-scale online experiment where participants ($N = 1\,008$) iteratively \textit{select} images from evolving markets and \textit{produce} their own modifications. Results show that exposing the popularity of images reduces cultural diversity and slows innovation, delaying aesthetic improvements. These findings are mediated by alterations of both selection and creation. During selection, popularity information triggers cumulative advantage, with participants preferentially building upon popular images, reducing diversity. During creation, participants make less disruptive changes, and are more likely to expand existing visual patterns. Feedback loops in cultural markets thus not only shape selection, but also, directly or indirectly, the form and direction of cultural innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in analyzing complex single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and evaluate whether current AI agents can generate biological insights from such data effectively.

Method: The authors develop scBench, which includes 394 verifiable problems mimicking real scRNA-seq workflows, deterministic graders for biological result analysis, and benchmarking of eight AI models across different sequencing platforms and tasks.

Result: Accuracy of AI agents evaluated using scBench ranges from 29% to 53%, with significant interactions between task types, model performance, and sequencing platforms. Less-documented platforms showed a marked drop in accuracy.

Conclusion: scBench serves as a benchmarking and diagnostic framework to enhance the analysis of scRNA-seq datasets, providing insights into performance variability and supporting reproducible research in single-cell bioinformatics.

Abstract: As single-cell RNA sequencing datasets grow in adoption, scale, and complexity, data analysis remains a bottleneck for many research groups. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world single-cell datasets. We introduce scBench, a benchmark of 394 verifiable problems derived from practical scRNA-seq workflows spanning six sequencing platforms and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on eight frontier models shows that accuracy ranges from 29-53%, with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Platform choice affects accuracy as much as model choice, with 40+ percentage point drops on less-documented technologies. scBench complements SpatialBench to cover the two dominant single-cell modalities, serving both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can analyze real scRNA-seq datasets faithfully and reproducibly.

Method: AntigenLM was pre-trained on influenza genomes with aligned functional units (HA and NA sequences) and fine-tuned for antigenic variant forecasting and subtype classification. Ablation experiments tested the impact of disrupting genomic structure.

Result: AntigenLM outperformed existing phylogenetic and evolution-based models in variant forecasting, achieved high accuracy in subtype classification, and demonstrated the importance of intact genomic structure through ablation studies.

Conclusion: AntigenLM offers an advanced model for antigen evolution and subtype classification while providing insights into the significance of structural integrity in DNA language modeling.

Abstract: Language models have advanced sequence analysis, yet DNA foundation models often lag behind task-specific methods for unclear reasons. We present AntigenLM, a generative DNA language model pretrained on influenza genomes with intact, aligned functional units. This structure-aware pretraining enables AntigenLM to capture evolutionary constraints and generalize across tasks. Fine-tuned on time-series hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences, AntigenLM accurately forecasts future antigenic variants across regions and subtypes, including those unseen during training, outperforming phylogenetic and evolution-based models. It also achieves near-perfect subtype classification. Ablation studies show that disrupting genomic structure through fragmentation or shuffling severely degrades performance, revealing the importance of preserving functional-unit integrity in DNA language modeling. AntigenLM thus provides both a powerful framework for antigen evolution prediction and a general principle for building biologically grounded DNA foundation models.

### [331] [SAS-Net: Scene-Appearance Separation Network for Robust Spatiotemporal Registration in Bidirectional Photoacoustic Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09050)
*Jiahao Qin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposed a high-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) framework to correct alignment issues during bidirectional scanning for real-time brain imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bidirectional scanning in OR-PAM enables high-speed functional imaging but introduces spatial and temporal misalignments due to domain shift and geometric distortion, which conventional methods fail to handle efficiently.

Method: A novel scene-appearance separation framework was developed to differentiate domain-invariant scene content from domain-specific features. Geometric preservation was ensured while using a scene consistency loss to maintain spatial and domain accuracy.

Result: The method outperformed conventional systems with significantly high normalized cross-correlation (0.961) and structural similarity index (0.894), along with a rapid 11.2 ms inference time per frame.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust and real-time high-speed OR-PAM with reliable imaging quality for functional and longitudinal brain studies. The code will be released for public use.

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional scanning enables rapid functional brain imaging but introduces severe spatiotemporal
  misalignment from coupled scan-direction-dependent domain shift and geometric distortion. Conventional registration methods rely on brightness constancy, an assumption
  violated under bidirectional scanning, leading to unreliable alignment. A unified scene-appearance separation framework is proposed to jointly address domain shift and
  spatial misalignment. The proposed architecture separates domain-invariant scene content from domain-specific appearance characteristics, enabling cross-domain
  reconstruction with geometric preservation. A scene consistency loss promotes geometric correspondence in the latent space, linking domain shift correction with spatial
  registration within a single framework. For in vivo mouse brain vasculature imaging, the proposed method achieves normalized cross-correlation (NCC) of 0.961 and
  structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.894, substantially outperforming conventional methods. Ablation studies demonstrate that domain alignment loss is critical,
  with its removal causing 82% NCC reduction (0.961 to 0.175), while scene consistency and cycle consistency losses provide complementary regularization for optimal
  performance. The method achieves 11.2 ms inference time per frame (86 fps), substantially exceeding typical OR-PAM acquisition rates and enabling real-time processing.
  These results suggest that the proposed framework enables robust high-speed bidirectional OR-PAM for reliable quantitative and longitudinal functional imaging. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAS-Net

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes GMM-Anchored JEPA to address representation collapse in self-supervised speech learning, enhancing performance in various speech-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve representation collapse issues in JEPA for speech learning without the need for iterative re-clustering.

Method: Gaussian Mixture Model fitted on log-mel spectrograms is used to provide frozen soft posteriors as auxiliary targets. Training begins with GMM regularization using a decaying supervision schedule.

Result: Significant improvements in ASR (28.68% vs. 33.22% WER), emotion recognition (67.76% vs. 65.46%), and slot filling (64.7% vs. 59.1% F1). Better cluster utilization, achieving up to 98% entropy compared to 31% in the baseline.

Conclusion: GMM anchoring enhances JEPA's performance in self-supervised speech tasks and achieves better representation utilization. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising approach to self-supervised speech representation learning, but suffer from representation collapse without explicit grounding. We propose GMM-Anchored JEPA, which fits a Gaussian Mixture Model once on log-mel spectrograms and uses its frozen soft posteriors as auxiliary targets throughout training. A decaying supervision schedule allows GMM regularization to dominate early training before gradually yielding to the JEPA objective. Unlike HuBERT and WavLM, which require iterative re-clustering, our approach clusters input features once with soft rather than hard assignments. On ~50k hours of speech, GMM anchoring improves ASR (28.68% vs. 33.22% WER), emotion recognition (67.76% vs. 65.46%), and slot filling (64.7% vs. 59.1% F1) compared to a WavLM-style baseline with matched compute. Cluster analysis shows GMM-anchored representations achieve up to 98% entropy compared to 31% for WavLM-style, indicating substantially more uniform cluster utilization.

*Qiang Guan,Qinglei Cao,Xiaoyi Lu,Siyuan Niu*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a checkpointing and restoration method for quantum HPC by redefining checkpointing as a control flow issue, utilizing dynamic circuits to ensure resilience and restartability in quantum workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum HPC lacks effective methods for resilient execution and recovery in the face of interruptions and failures, necessitating innovative approaches for checkpointing and restoration.

Method: Instead of directly checkpointing quantum states, the method employs dynamic circuit features such as mid-circuit measurements, classical feedback, and conditional execution to save sufficient program state for restoration.

Result: The proposed design aligns well with iterative and staged quantum algorithms like variational eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, and quantum simulation methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic circuits can enable effective checkpointing and restoration in quantum HPC, supporting the demands of scientific and high-performance quantum computing.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the design of the checkpointing and restoration for quantum HPC that leverages dynamic circuit technology to enable restartable and resilient quantum execution. Rather than attempting to checkpoint quantum states, our approach redefines checkpointing as a control flow and algorithmic state problem. By exploiting mid-circuit measurements, classical feed forward, and conditional execution supported by dynamic circuits, we capture sufficient program state to allow correct restoration of quantum workflows after interruption or failure. This design aligns naturally with iterative and staged quantum algorithms such as variational eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, and time-stepping methods commonly used in quantum simulation and scientific computing.

### [334] [Global Protocols under Rendezvous Synchrony: From Realizability to Type Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09197)
*Elaine Li,Felix Stutz*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the synchronous realizability problem for distributed processes using rendezvous synchrony, presenting both decidable cases with specific complexity bounds and the general undecidability result. A type system is introduced for type-checking pi-calculus processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to provide a comprehensive approach to the verification and realization of distributed processes that communicate synchronously, addressing issues of decidability and practical type-checking challenges in such systems.

Method: The authors analyze global protocol specifications for distributed processes under different conditions, establish complexity bounds for realizability and verification, demonstrate general undecidability in some cases, and design a type system for verifying processes against local specifications.

Result: They identify that synchronous realizability is decidable under specific constraints (e.g., transitive concurrency alphabets or unambiguous global protocols) but undecidable in the general case. Additionally, a novel type system is proposed for verifying complex process specifications.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the challenges in synchronous realizability but offer a pathway for practical verification in specific cases. The introduced type system represents progress in managing advanced specification requirements, such as mixed choice and delegation.

Abstract: Global protocol specifications are the starting point of top-down verification methodologies, and serve as a blueprint for synthesizing local specifications that guarantee the correctness of distributed implementations. In this work, we study global protocol specifications targeting distributed processes that communicate via rendezvous synchrony. We obtain the following positive results for the synchronous realizability problem: (a) realizability is decidable for global protocols over a transitive concurrency alphabet in 2-EXPTIME in the size of the protocol, and in 3-EXPTIME in the size of the alphabet, and (b) realizability is decidable in EXPTIME for global protocols that unambiguously represent their trace language. Unambiguous global protocols encompass fragments of directed and sender-driven choice protocols studied in prior work. Further, our reductions admit the corollary that the synchronous verification problem is solvable with the same complexity, where a candidate realization is included as part of the input. We then prove a negative result stating that synchronous realizability is undecidable in general. Finally, we propose a type system to check pi-calculus processes against local specifications in the form of synchronous communicating state machines. Our type system is the first to support processes with local mixed choice in the presence of session interleaving and~delegation.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DSFlow introduces a modular distillation framework for efficient text-to-speech synthesis and addresses endpoint error accumulation and structural inefficiencies in discrete generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-matching models face computational inefficiencies during iterative inference sampling, with distillation methods suffering from endpoint errors and inefficiencies in structural parameters.

Method: DSFlow reformulates synthesis as a discrete prediction task, employs dual supervision for stable training, and replaces continuous timestep conditioning with lightweight step-aware tokens.

Result: Experiments show DSFlow achieves superior synthesis quality in few-step and one-step tasks, improves parameter efficiency, and reduces inference cost compared to standard distillation methods.

Conclusion: DSFlow provides a robust solution for efficient and high-quality text-to-speech synthesis through improved distillation methods and structural adaptations.

Abstract: Flow-matching models have enabled high-quality text-to-speech synthesis, but their iterative sampling process during inference incurs substantial computational cost. Although distillation is widely used to reduce the number of inference steps, existing methods often suffer from process variance due to endpoint error accumulation. Moreover, directly reusing continuous-time architectures for discrete, fixed-step generation introduces structural parameter inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce DSFlow, a modular distillation framework for few-step and one-step synthesis. DSFlow reformulates generation as a discrete prediction task and explicitly adapts the student model to the target inference regime. It improves training stability through a dual supervision strategy that combines endpoint matching with deterministic mean-velocity alignment, enforcing consistent generation trajectories across inference steps. In addition, DSFlow improves parameter efficiency by replacing continuous-time timestep conditioning with lightweight step-aware tokens, aligning model capacity with the significantly reduced timestep space of the discrete task. Extensive experiments across diverse flow-based text-to-speech architectures demonstrate that DSFlow consistently outperforms standard distillation approaches, achieving strong few-step and one-step synthesis quality while reducing model parameters and inference cost.

*Yufan Wen,Zhaocheng Liu,YeGuo Hua,Ziyi Guo,Lihua Zhang,Chun Yuan,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents NarraScore, a method for generating soundtracks for long-form videos by addressing existing challenges like scalability, coherence, and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges in generating coherent and narrative-aligned soundtracks for long-form videos, which include computational limitations, temporal coherence issues, and lack of semantic understanding.

Method: The paper introduces NarraScore, a hierarchical framework that uses emotion as a proxy for narrative logic. It employs Vision-Language Models as continuous affective sensors and uses a Dual-Branch Injection strategy to reconcile global stability and local dynamics in soundtrack generation.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that NarraScore achieves state-of-the-art performance in consistency and narrative alignment with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: NarraScore effectively resolves key challenges in long-video soundtrack synthesis, enabling fully autonomous, narrative-aligned soundtracks with high consistency and efficiency.

Abstract: Synthesizing coherent soundtracks for long-form videos remains a formidable challenge, currently stalled by three critical impediments: computational scalability, temporal coherence, and, most critically, a pervasive semantic blindness to evolving narrative logic. To bridge these gaps, we propose NarraScore, a hierarchical framework predicated on the core insight that emotion serves as a high-density compression of narrative logic. Uniquely, we repurpose frozen Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as continuous affective sensors, distilling high-dimensional visual streams into dense, narrative-aware Valence-Arousal trajectories. Mechanistically, NarraScore employs a Dual-Branch Injection strategy to reconcile global structure with local dynamism: a \textit{Global Semantic Anchor} ensures stylistic stability, while a surgical \textit{Token-Level Affective Adapter} modulates local tension via direct element-wise residual injection. This minimalist design bypasses the bottlenecks of dense attention and architectural cloning, effectively mitigating the overfitting risks associated with data scarcity. Experiments demonstrate that NarraScore achieves state-of-the-art consistency and narrative alignment with negligible computational overhead, establishing a fully autonomous paradigm for long-video soundtrack generation.

*Yihan Zhang,Hong Chang Ji,Ramji Venkataramanan,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses parameter estimation in generalized linear models with orthogonally invariant random design matrices, proposing optimal spectral estimators and an accompanying AMP algorithm to enhance performance in complex correlation structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by challenges in real datasets that exhibit complex correlation structures, which render methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions inadequate.

Method: The paper utilizes optimal spectral estimators for initialization and approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms to achieve improved estimation performance.

Result: Rigorous performance guarantees are established for the proposed spectral and AMP methods, and experiments showcase effectiveness beyond orthogonally invariant designs.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques meet conjectured fundamental limits and demonstrate both theoretical and experimental efficacy for enhanced parameter estimation in correlated data structures.

Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation from a generalized linear model with a random design matrix that is orthogonally invariant in law. Such a model allows the design have an arbitrary distribution of singular values and only assumes that its singular vectors are generic. It is a vast generalization of the i.i.d. Gaussian design typically considered in the theoretical literature, and is motivated by the fact that real data often have a complex correlation structure so that methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions can be highly suboptimal. Building on the paradigm of spectrally-initialized iterative optimization, this paper proposes optimal spectral estimators and combines them with an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, establishing rigorous performance guarantees for these two algorithmic steps. Both the spectral initialization and the subsequent AMP meet existing conjectures on the fundamental limits to estimation -- the former on the optimal sample complexity for efficient weak recovery, and the latter on the optimal errors. Numerical experiments suggest the effectiveness of our methods and accuracy of our theory beyond orthogonally invariant data.

*Hugo Latourelle-Vigeant,Theodor Misiakiewicz*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The study analyzes multi-index models (MIMs) where labels depend on projections of inputs, deriving both theoretical complexity bounds and practical algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning complexity of multi-index models with spherically symmetric inputs, improving on previous Gaussian-specific studies.

Method: Used harmonic-analytic tools, Statistical Query (SQ), and Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) frameworks to derive complexity bounds; developed spectral algorithms leveraging spherical harmonics and tensor decomposition.

Result: Obtained sharp statistical and computational lower bounds for learning MIMs and proposed spectral algorithms that nearly achieve these bounds.

Conclusion: The work provides both theoretical insights and practical algorithms, offering a flexible trade-off between sample size and runtime efficiency.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-index models (MIMs), where the label depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through an unknown $\mathsf{s}$-dimensional projection $\boldsymbol{W}_*^\mathsf{T} \boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\mathsf{s}$. Exploiting the equivariance of this problem under the orthogonal group $\mathcal{O}_d$, we obtain a sharp harmonic-analytic characterization of the learning complexity for MIMs with spherically symmetric inputs -- which refines and generalizes previous Gaussian-specific analyses. Specifically, we derive statistical and computational complexity lower bounds within the Statistical Query (SQ) and Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) frameworks. These bounds decompose naturally across spherical harmonic subspaces. Guided by this decomposition, we construct a family of spectral algorithms based on harmonic tensor unfolding that sequentially recover the latent directions and (nearly) achieve these SQ and LDP lower bounds. Depending on the choice of harmonic degree sequence, these estimators can realize a broad range of trade-offs between sample and runtime complexity. From a technical standpoint, our results build on the semisimple decomposition of the $\mathcal{O}_d$-action on $L^2 (\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ and the intertwining isomorphism between spherical harmonics and traceless symmetric tensors.

*Illia Donhauzer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF), an extension of the Isolation Forest algorithm that incorporates feature-specific sensitivities for anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods often assume equal sensitivity to deviations in all features, which is limiting. This paper aims to address this gap by developing a method for variable feature sensitivity within isolation-based frameworks.

Method: The authors propose the AIF, which introduces adjustable sensitivity to deviations across different features or directions in the feature space. They also define new measures of directional sensitivity to quantify and adjust the algorithm's sensitivity.

Result: The AIF was tested on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it allows anomaly detection to focus on relevant directions in the feature space where divergences matter more.

Conclusion: The AIF enhances anomaly detection capabilities by incorporating controllable, feature-specific sensitivities, improving task-specific adaptability.

Abstract: Compared to theoretical frameworks that assume equal sensitivity to deviations in all features of data, the theory of anomaly detection allowing for variable sensitivity across features is less developed. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not yet been addressed in the context of isolation-based methods, and this paper represents the first attempt to do so. This paper introduces an Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities, which we refer to as the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF). In contrast to the standard EIF, the AIF enables anomaly detection with controllable sensitivity to deviations in different features or directions in the feature space. The paper also introduces novel measures of directional sensitivity, which allow quantification of AIF's sensitivity in different directions in the feature space. These measures enable adjustment of the AIF's sensitivity to task-specific requirements. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the AIF enables anomaly detection that focuses on directions in the feature space where deviations from typical behavior are more important.

### [340] [Online Selective Conformal Prediction with Asymmetric Rules: A Permutation Test Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10018)
*Mingyi Zheng,Ying Jin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a framework providing valid coverage for selective conformal prediction under arbitrary asymmetric selection rules in the online setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of asymmetric selection mechanisms in online conformal prediction while maintaining valid predictive coverage.

Method: PEMI identifies permutations preserving selection events and uses conformity scores for calibration, achieving selection-conditional coverage.

Result: PEMI achieves exact finite-sample selection-conditional coverage for asymmetric selection rules under exchangeability conditions, integrates offline data, and performs effectively in simulations and drug discovery tests.

Conclusion: PEMI generalizes selective conformal prediction to arbitrary asymmetric mechanisms and demonstrates practical applicability and robustness in varied contexts.

Abstract: Selective conformal prediction aims to construct prediction sets with valid coverage for a test unit conditional on it being selected by a data-driven mechanism. While existing methods in the offline setting handle any selection mechanism that is permutation invariant to the labeled data, their extension to the online setting -- where data arrives sequentially and later decisions depend on earlier ones -- is challenged by the fact that the selection mechanism is naturally asymmetric. As such, existing methods only address a limited collection of selection mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a general permutation-based framework for selective conformal prediction with arbitrary asymmetric selection rules. Motivated by full and Mondrian conformal prediction, PEMI identifies all permutations of the observed data (or a Monte-Carlo subset thereof) that lead to the same selection event, and calibrates a prediction set using conformity scores over this selection-preserving reference set. Under standard exchangeability conditions, our prediction sets achieve finite-sample exact selection-conditional coverage for any asymmetric selection mechanism and any prediction model. PEMI naturally incorporates additional offline labeled data, extends to selection mechanisms with multiple test samples, and achieves FCR control with fine-grained selection taxonomies. We further work out several efficient instantiations for commonly-used online selection rules, including covariate-based rules, conformal p/e-values-based procedures, and selection based on earlier outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods across various selection rules on a real drug discovery dataset and investigate their performance via simulations.

TL;DR: This paper examines the interplay between AI-driven targeting systems and violence, using the case of Israel in Gaza. It explores political, professional, and personal responsibility while stressing the societal narratives that normalize AI-enabled warfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to critique the growing role of AI in warfare and its ethical, political, and governance implications. It focuses on accountability and the uncritical normalization of violence facilitated by automated technologies.

Method: Through the lens of responsibility, the paper analyzes political, professional, and personal dimensions of AI in militarization, complemented by discourse analysis regarding its societal normalization.

Result: The study illustrates how AI systems actively perpetuate colonial hierarchies and legitimize violence. It highlights the complicity of various actors and the influence of societal narratives on public perception.

Conclusion: The paper calls for democratizing AI ethics, challenging technocratic approaches, and prioritizing the experiences of those affected by algorithmic warfare to confront algorithmic violence effectively.

Abstract: The accelerating militarization of artificial intelligence has transformed the ethics, politics, and governance of warfare. This article interrogates how AI-driven targeting systems function as epistemic infrastructures that classify, legitimize, and execute violence, using Israel's conduct in Gaza as a paradigmatic case. Through the lens of responsibility, the article examines three interrelated dimensions: (a) political responsibility, exploring how states exploit AI to accelerate warfare while evading accountability; (b) professional responsibility, addressing the complicity of technologists, engineers, and defense contractors in the weaponization of data; and (c) personal responsibility, probing the moral agency of individuals who participate in or resist algorithmic governance. This is complemented by an examination of the position and influence of those participating in public discourse, whose narratives often obscure or normalize AI-enabled violence. The Gaza case reveals AI not as a neutral instrument but as an active participant in the reproduction of colonial hierarchies and the normalization of atrocity. Ultimately, the paper calls for a reframing of technological agency and accountability in the age of automated warfare. It concludes that confronting algorithmic violence demands a democratization of AI ethics, one that resists technocratic fatalism and centers the lived realities of those most affected by high-tech militarism.

TL;DR: XLB is an innovative in-kernel L7 load balancer using eBPF that outperforms traditional solutions by providing higher throughput and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservices require higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers due to an increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the need for co-location. Traditional sidecar-based solutions fail to meet these requirements.

Method: XLB leverages eBPF to implement load balancing at the socket layer, introduces novel designs for socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps, and eliminates overheads in scheduling, communication, and data movement.

Result: XLB demonstrates significantly better performance, with up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower latency compared to established microservice load balancers like Istio and Cilium.

Conclusion: XLB provides a lightweight, scalable, and efficient load balancing solution that addresses the specific challenges posed by microservices with superior performance.

Abstract: L7 load balancers are a fundamental building block in microservices as they enable fine-grained traffic distribution. Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.
  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency.

*Mahir Rahman,Samuel Joseph,Nihar Kodkani,Behnaz Arzani,Vamsi Addanki*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Harvest, a method to systematically schedule photonic interconnect reconfiguration for collective communication, balancing reconfiguration delay with congestion and propagation delay to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient chip-to-chip silicon photonics suffer delays due to their circuit-switched nature and require optimized reconfiguration to overcome congestion and propagation delays for better collective communication.

Method: The paper proposes Harvest, a method that uses dynamic programming combined with topology optimization to determine optimal reconfiguration schedules for photonic interconnects. It also exploits the natural structure of well-known algorithms like Recursive Doubling for optimization.

Result: Harvest reduces collective completion time by synthesizing better reconfiguration schedules, as demonstrated through evaluations with multiple algorithms, packet-level and flow-level testing, and hardware emulations on GPUs.

Conclusion: Harvest effectively synthesizes reconfiguration schedules tailored to varying technologies, outperforming static and naive reconfiguration approaches, thus enhancing the efficiency of collective communication in photonic interconnects.

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and energy efficiency, their circuit-switched nature raises a fundamental question for collective communication: when and how should the interconnect be reconfigured to realize these benefits? Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.
  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a finite-time stable pose estimator (FTS-PE) for rigid bodies, focusing on stability, robustness to noise, and avoiding singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of estimating the pose of rigid bodies in 3D motion while avoiding singularities and unwinding effects.

Method: The method involves a Lyapunov-based design of a state observer on SE(3) without local coordinates or dual quaternions, supplemented by a version using minimal sensor inputs.

Result: The FTS-PE has been validated through simulations against other estimators and experimentally with stereo depth camera data, showcasing robust and stable performance.

Conclusion: The FTS-PE reliably estimates rigid body poses in finite time, overcoming traditional challenges like singularity and unwinding, making it suitable for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: This work presents a finite-time stable pose estimator (FTS-PE) for rigid bodies undergoing rotational and translational motion in three dimensions, using measurements from onboard sensors that provide position vectors to inertially-fixed points and body velocities. The FTS-PE is a full-state observer for the pose (position and orientation) and velocities and is obtained through a Lyapunov analysis that shows its stability in finite time and its robustness to bounded measurement noise. Further, this observer is designed directly on the state space, the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions, SE(3), without using local coordinates or (dual) quaternion representations. Therefore, it can estimate arbitrary rigid body motions without encountering singularities or the unwinding phenomenon and be readily applied to autonomous vehicles. A version of this observer that does not need translational velocity measurements and uses only point clouds and angular velocity measurements from rate gyros, is also obtained. It is discretized using the framework of geometric mechanics for numerical and experimental implementations. The numerical simulations compare the FTS-PE with a dual-quaternion extended Kalman filter and our previously developed variational pose estimator (VPE). The experimental results are obtained using point cloud images and rate gyro measurements obtained from a Zed 2i stereo depth camera sensor. These results validate the stability and robustness of the FTS-PE.

*Luigi Romano,Ole Morten Aamo,Jan Åslund,Erik Frisk*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model-based lateral tracking control strategy for autonomous vehicles, leveraging smart tire technologies and PDE-based tire dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autonomous vehicle control by integrating robust model-based approaches to tire dynamics, addressing limitations in existing empirical and machine learning methods.

Method: Developed an output-feedback lateral tracking control approach using ODE-PDE systems to incorporate distributed tire dynamics and smart tire sensing capabilities.

Result: The control strategy suppresses micro-shimmy effects at low speeds and facilitates path-following through precise force control and vehicle kinematics estimation.

Conclusion: This research introduces a rigorous vehicular control strategy combining smart tire technology with distributed tire dynamics models, advancing autonomous vehicle stability and handling.

Abstract: The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior. This work marks the first rigorous control strategy for vehicular systems equipped with distributed tire representations in conjunction with smart tire technologies.

### [346] [First-order friction models with bristle dynamics: lumped and distributed formulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09429)
*Luigi Romano,Ole Morten Aamo,Jan Åslund,Erik Frisk*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physically derived, first-order dynamic friction model with connections to the LuGre model, analyzing its stability, passivity, and presenting a distributed formulation as a PDE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rate-dependent friction models are effective but largely empirical; the paper aims to derive a physically motivated model for better interpretability.

Method: Starting from physical principles, a novel friction model is developed using a rheological approach and presented both as an ODE (ordinary differential equation) and as a hyperbolic PDE for distributed phenomena like rolling contact.

Result: The proposed model is validated via experiments and compared to the LuGre model, showing similarities and differences in tribological behavior.

Conclusion: The new model offers a physically grounded alternative for friction modeling with practical applications in control, observer design, and tribological analysis.

Abstract: Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences.

*Yangzhe Peng,Haiquan Qiu,Quanming Yao,Kun He*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOSQ, a framework that reduces the computational cost of using LLMs on text-attributed graphs while maintaining or improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and monetary cost of using LLMs for node-level tasks on TAGs limits their practicality, motivating the need for an efficient solution.

Method: The authors propose BOSQ, which uses a bilevel optimization approach and an adaptive sparse querying strategy to selectively decide when to leverage LLMs, avoiding redundant or low-impact queries.

Result: On six real-world TAG datasets, BOSQ shows significant speedups and delivers performance that is consistently on-par or better than existing GraphLLM methods.

Conclusion: BOSQ effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, making the use of LLMs on TAGs more practical and scalable.

Abstract: LLMs have recently shown strong potential in enhancing node-level tasks on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) by providing explanation features. However, their practical use is severely limited by the high computational and monetary cost of repeated LLM queries. To illustrate, naively generating explanations for all nodes on a medium-sized benchmark like Photo (48k nodes) using a representative method (e.g., TAPE) would consume days of processing time. In this paper, we propose Bilevel-Optimized Sparse Querying (BOSQ), a general framework that selectively leverages LLM-derived explanation features to enhance performance on node-level tasks on TAGs. We design an adaptive sparse querying strategy that selectively decides when to invoke LLMs, avoiding redundant or low-gain queries and significantly reducing computation overhead. Extensive experiments on six real-world TAG datasets involving two types of node-level tasks demonstrate that BOSQ achieves orders of magnitude speedups over existing GraphLLM methods while consistently delivering on-par or superior performance.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient retrieval method leveraging metric-based pruning to reduce the computational cost of suffix comparisons in prescriptive process monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heavy computational cost of large-scale suffix comparisons, which limits scalability, is a major challenge in prescriptive process monitoring.

Method: The method uses the triangle inequality with optimized pivots to create bounds that prune redundant comparisons, ensuring exact retrieval while reducing runtime.

Result: The approach demonstrated substantial runtime reduction, full parallelizability, and achieved identical suffix retrieval accuracy compared to exhaustive methods.

Conclusion: Metric-based pruning is effective in accelerating suffix comparison without compromising accuracy, supporting scalable prescriptive systems.

Abstract: Prescriptive process monitoring seeks to recommend actions that improve process outcomes by analyzing possible continuations of ongoing cases. A key obstacle is the heavy computational cost of large-scale suffix comparisons, which grows rapidly with log size. We propose an efficient retrieval method exploiting the triangle inequality: distances to a set of optimized pivots define bounds that prune redundant comparisons. This substantially reduces runtime and is fully parallelizable. Crucially, pruning is exact: the retrieved suffixes are identical to those from exhaustive comparison, thereby preserving accuracy. These results show that metric-based pruning can accelerate suffix comparison and support scalable prescriptive systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient 2D CNN-based artifact removal framework for EEG signal processing, achieving significant reductions in inference time and power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and computational challenges in removing artifacts from EEG signals, especially for real-time applications in edge devices.

Method: Replaces 1D CNNs with 2D CNNs and introduces the E2CAR framework, deployed on Edge TPUs to reduce computational cost and power usage.

Result: Achieved a 90% reduction in inference time and an 18.98% decrease in power consumption while maintaining competitive artifact removal performance.

Conclusion: The proposed E2CAR framework optimizes EEG artifact removal for edge devices, balancing computational efficiency and signal processing effectiveness.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently contaminated by artifacts, affecting the accuracy of subsequent analysis. Traditional artifact removal methods are often computationally expensive and inefficient for real-time applications in edge devices. This paper presents a method to reduce the computational cost of most existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) by replacing one-dimensional (1-D) CNNs with two-dimensional (2-D) CNNs and deploys them on Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is an open-resource hardware accelerator widely used in edge devices for low-latency, low-power operation. A new Efficient 2D-CNN Artifact Removal (E2CAR) framework is also represented using the method above, and it achieves a 90\% reduction in inference time on the TPU and decreases power consumption by 18.98\%, while maintaining comparable artifact removal performance to existing methods. This approach facilitates efficient EEG signal processing on edge devices.

TL;DR: This study analyzes AI agents' interactions on Moltbook, finding similarities and differences with human online behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether AI agent behavior in social media platforms mirrors human online social behavior by studying AI-driven content and engagement patterns.

Method: Analyzed 369,000 posts and 3.0 million comments from 46,000 AI agents, evaluating metrics like activity distributions, popularity scaling, and temporal attention patterns.

Result: AI agents show similar statistical patterns to human online communities but differ in specific aspects, such as the relationship between upvotes and discussion size.

Conclusion: AI collective dynamics resemble human social structures in some ways, but distinct differences emphasize the unique nature of autonomous AI behavior.

Abstract: We present a large scale data analysis of Moltbook, a Reddit-style social media platform exclusively populated by AI agents. Analyzing over 369,000 posts and 3.0 million comments from approximately 46,000 active agents, we find that AI collective behavior exhibits many of the same statistical regularities observed in human online communities: heavy-tailed distributions of activity, power-law scaling of popularity metrics, and temporal decay patterns consistent with limited attention dynamics. However, we also identify key differences, including a sublinear relationship between upvotes and discussion size that contrasts with human behavior. These findings suggest that, while individual AI agents may differ fundamentally from humans, their emergent collective dynamics share structural similarities with human social systems.

*Sahel Azizpour,Viola Priesemann,Johannes Zierenberg,Anna Levina*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper investigates how optimal sensitivity in recurrent neural networks depends on finite integration times, showing it may shift away from criticality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how systems can maximize sensitivity to environmental changes within realistic time constraints.

Method: Analytical and computational exploration of optimal tuning in recurrent neural networks under finite integration times.

Result: Networks exhibit varying sensitivities based on time constraints, shifting optimal dynamics away from criticality.

Conclusion: Finite-time considerations are essential in analyzing information processing and dynamic regimes of systems.

Abstract: Sensitivity to small changes in the environment is crucial for many real-world tasks, enabling living and artificial systems to make correct behavioral decisions. It has been shown that such sensitivity is maximized when a system operates near the critical point of a phase transition. However, proximity to criticality introduces large fluctuations and diverging timescales. Hence, to leverage the maximal sensitivity, it would require impractically long integration periods. Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing.
