### [1] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for explaining chess engine evaluations by attributing scores to specific chess pieces using SHAP techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency in chess engine evaluations limits human understanding, making it difficult to interpret their decisions.

Method: Adapting SHAP methodology to treat chess pieces as features, the approach systematically calculates contributions of individual pieces to the chess engine's evaluation.

Result: A locally faithful, human-interpretable explanation of chess engine outputs is produced, enabling enhanced visualization and learning.

Conclusion: The study bridges classical chess pedagogy and explainable AI, providing tools for better understanding and fostering future research in interpretable chess engines.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [2] [An Agentic Framework for Rapid Deployment of Edge AI Solutions in Industry 5.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25813)
*Jorge Martinez-Gil,Mario Pichler,Nefeli Bountouni,Sotiris Koussouris,Marielena Márquez Barreiro,Sergio Gusmeroli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for Industry 5.0 that facilitates AI model deployment on edge devices with local processing and modular integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce latency, avoid data transfer issues, and improve AI deployment and adaptability in industrial settings.

Method: Proposes an agent-based, modular framework for local inference and real-time processing on edge devices.

Result: Framework evaluation in the food industry shows enhanced deployment time and adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework is promising for achieving efficient and flexible AI application in Industry 5.0 scenarios, with code made open-source.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for Industry 5.0 that simplifies the deployment
of AI models on edge devices in various industrial settings. The design reduces
latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are
responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying
integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains
low resource requirements. Preliminary evaluations concerning the food industry
in real scenarios indicate improved deployment time and system adaptability
performance. The source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Symbolically Scaffolded Play: Designing Role-Sensitive Prompts for Generative NPC Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25820)
*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether constrained prompts improve the player experience in a GPT-4-powered detective game, finding mixed impacts on NPC interactions and proposing a new framework for balancing coherence and improvisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore how constrained prompts in LLM-powered interactive games impact the player experience, as current approaches to NPC dialogue lack clarity on experiential improvements.

Method: A within-subjects usability study was conducted with 10 participants to compare high-constraint and low-constraint prompts, followed by a synthetic evaluation using an LLM judge to examine the effects of redesigned scaffolds.

Result: The study revealed that constrained scaffolds enhance stability for quest-giver NPCs but reduce improvisational believability for suspect NPCs. The results question the assumption that tighter constraints are always beneficial.

Conclusion: The authors propose "Symbolically Scaffolded Play," a framework to balance symbolic structure and fuzzy boundaries, aiming to stabilize coherence and preserve improvisation where it supports engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

### [4] [Through the Judge's Eyes: Inferred Thinking Traces Improve Reliability of LLM Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25860)
*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a collaborative human-LLM framework to infer thinking traces from label-only annotations, aiming to improve LLM-human agreement in evaluation tasks and annotation guideline clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited reliability of LLMs in subjective tasks that require nuanced reasoning, by leveraging thinking traces which are challenging to collect.

Method: The paper proposes a rejection sampling method to infer thinking traces from labels, leveraging these traces to fine-tune open LLM raters and create improved annotation guidelines.

Result: The approach significantly improves LLM-human agreement across datasets and enhances agreement across different LLM models through refined annotation guidelines.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that LLMs can effectively act as proxies for human thinking traces, allowing for label-only annotations to evolve into resources that improve LLM rater reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [5] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model, achieves comparable performance to GPT-4o on FACTS Grounding tasks within a ±5 percentage points equivalence margin, while being 19 times cheaper for cloud API usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a cost-efficient AI model that matches or surpasses the accuracy of high-performing large models like GPT-4o in factual grounding tasks.

Method: Combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning focused on protocol compliance (epistemic discipline) rather than purely domain-specific answers.

Result: Humans-Junior scored 72.7% compared to GPT-4o’s 73.5% on the FACTS Grounding dataset under identical conditions. Behavioral fine-tuning synergistically improves performance by +17.7 percentage points and reduces variance by ~25%. Directed reasoning further improves prompt performance on frontier models.

Conclusion: Humans-Junior demonstrates competitive performance to large-scale models like GPT-4o while offering significant cost savings in cloud deployment and potential further reductions in self-hosted scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [6] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework linking compression to intelligence, emphasizing discovery of causal models instead of surface patterns. It proposes theoretical principles to explain this connection and offers predictions connecting compression efficiency with aspects like generalization and model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks emphasize compression's role in intelligence but fail to clarify why it leads to causal discovery rather than just statistical pattern recognition.

Method: The paper introduces the Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) and Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) to explain the evolutionary and mechanical pathways from survival pressures to intelligence through compression processes.

Result: The framework connects survival pressure, predictive necessity, optimization of compression, and causal discovery as a chain of necessary outcomes. It predicts measurable traits, such as rates of exception accumulation correlating to causal models, across biological and artificial systems.

Conclusion: A unified theory is proposed for intelligence, suggesting it as a necessary result of persistence in complex environments, explained through physical and evolutionary constraints. It bridges observations across biological and artificial systems without requiring assumptions about consciousness.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

### [7] [Approximating Human Preferences Using a Multi-Judge Learned System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25884)
*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in aligning large language model (LLM) judges with human preferences and proposes a framework for aggregating rubric-conditioned judges to model diverse persona-based preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable reward models for RLHF and routing systems that select the best-suited model for specific user queries require improved alignment of LLM judges with human preferences.

Method: The authors propose a framework to synthesize persona-based preference labels at scale using multiple rubric-conditioned judges, with implementations as a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Result: This methodology's performance and robustness were evaluated against naive baselines, examining biases in human and LLM judges.

Conclusion: The framework for modeling diverse preferences and synthesizing preference labels shows promise in addressing alignment challenges in LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### [8] [SciTrust 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in Scientific Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25908)
*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciTrust 2.0, a framework for evaluating trustworthiness in large language models (LLMs) within scientific research, focusing on truthfulness, robustness, safety, and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address trustworthiness challenges in deploying LLMs in high-stakes scientific research scenarios.

Method: Proposed SciTrust 2.0 framework, incorporating truthfulness and ethics benchmarks, validated evaluations, and metrics tests applied to seven LLMs, including science-specialized and general-purpose models.

Result: General-purpose models outperformed science-specialized ones, with GPT-o4-mini excelling in truthfulness and robustness; science-specialized models lacked in logical and ethical reasoning and presented safety concerns.

Conclusion: SciTrust 2.0 offers a benchmark to improve trustworthiness of LLMs, contributing to advancements in safety and ethics in scientific applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

### [9] [FinOps Agent -- A Use-Case for IT Infrastructure and Cost Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25914)
*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Manish Kesarwani,Ruchi Mahindru,Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper outlines how AI agents can automate FinOps tasks to address the challenge of heterogeneous billing data, demonstrating their effectiveness with evaluated use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of analyzing complex heterogeneous billing data from multiple sources and using it for actionable insights in FinOps processes.

Method: The authors developed an autonomous AI agent simulating FinOps workflows, utilizing data consolidation, analysis, and optimization with different language models.

Result: The AI agent successfully performed tasks comparably to human FinOps practitioners, evaluated through predefined metrics.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the ability of AI agents to streamline FinOps tasks, proving their efficiency and replicability in real-world applications.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

### [10] [Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25951)
*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how people's attention biases impact their decision-making and action, introducing attention-aware inverse planning to estimate these biases using reinforcement learning and cognitive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems interacting with humans need awareness of cognitive biases, such as attentional biases, which influence goal-directed behaviors.

Method: The paper defines attention-aware inverse planning and incorporates deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling to analyze attentional biases.

Result: Using a dataset of real-life driving scenarios, the approach successfully infers attentional strategies and validates its scalability in estimating cognitive biases.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning is an effective method for understanding attentional biases, which may enhance autonomous system design and human interaction modeling.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

### [11] [From Queries to Insights: Agentic LLM Pipelines for Spatio-Temporal Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25997)
*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved pipeline for natural language to SQL systems using a ReAct agent for better handling of spatio-temporal queries with higher accuracy and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL-to-SQL systems perform poorly on realistic spatio-temporal queries, which require aligning vague user language with specific schema categories and handling complex reasoning effectively.

Method: It introduces an agentic pipeline extending a llama-3-sqlcoder-8b baseline with a Mistral-based ReAct agent to plan, decompose, and adapt queries, leveraging schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools.

Result: The system achieved 91.4% accuracy on spatio-temporal queries compared to 28.6% from the naive baseline, supporting usability enhancements like maps, plots, and structured summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration is highlighted as a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants, enabling intuitive human-database interaction without requiring SQL expertise or detailed schema knowledge.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a

in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

### [13] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces StuckSolver, an add-on framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to help autonomous vehicles resolve immobilization scenarios through autonomous reasoning and/or passenger-guided decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle in certain traffic situations, often becoming immobilized which disrupts traffic flow. Current recovery measures like remote intervention and manual takeover have limitations, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: The paper proposes StuckSolver, a plug-in framework based on Large Language Models that operates without altering the AV's architecture. It analyzes sensor data to detect immobilization states, interprets contexts, and provides recovery commands executed by the AV's existing systems.

Result: StuckSolver was tested using Bench2Drive benchmark and custom-designed uncertain scenarios, achieving near-state-of-the-art performance via self-reasoning. Performance improved further with passenger guidance.

Conclusion: StuckSolver enables autonomous vehicles to resolve complex immobilization scenarios efficiently by complementing their capabilities with LLM-driven reasoning and passenger support.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [14] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the urgent need for accountable AI systems by exploring their definition, current challenges in accountability, and potential improvement approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that increasingly powerful AI serves the needs of consumers, voters, and decision-makers by being transparent and answerable to those it impacts.

Method: The authors examine the concept of accountability within the context of AI, provide examples of accountable and unaccountable AIs, and propose solutions to improve accountability.

Result: The paper highlights deficiencies in the accountability of current AI systems and identifies strategies for fostering better accountability in the future.

Conclusion: Accountable AI is essential for ethical and effective integration of AI into society, and targeted interventions can address current shortcomings to achieve this goal.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance formal reasoning capabilities in physics by creating a benchmark and library in Lean4 framework.

Method: Develop and utilize LeanPhysBench (a benchmark of 200 physics statements) and PhysLib (a repository with core theorems and unit systems) to assess reasoning models.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS demonstrates challenges in formal physics reasoning tasks and provides tools to improve them. It is the first study to introduce a physics benchmark in Lean4.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model

### [16] [GUI Knowledge Bench: Revealing the Knowledge Gap Behind VLM Failures in GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26098)
*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large vision language models (VLMs) lag behind humans in automating GUI tasks due to gaps in core GUI knowledge. Researchers introduce GUI Knowledge Bench to evaluate and improve this knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap in GUI task automation by VLMs, which is attributed to missing core GUI knowledge and limitations in existing training methods.

Method: The researchers distilled GUI knowledge into three key dimensions (interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding). They created GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions spanning six platforms and 292 applications.

Result: Current VLMs perform well in recognizing widget functions but struggle with other aspects of GUI knowledge like perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion.

Conclusion: Structured assessment and enhancement of GUI knowledge can lead to more capable GUI agents and better selection of VLMs for downstream training.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: This paper examines the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing an economics framework to analyze their cost, scalability, and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing importance of inference costs in determining the commercial viability and adoption of LLMs.

Method: They propose a quantitative framework for analyzing the inference process as a computational production activity, with empirical evaluation using WiNEval-3.0.

Result: The study constructs the first 'LLM Inference Production Frontier' and identifies three principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone.

Conclusion: The research establishes an economic basis for deploying LLMs and sets the foundation for optimizing AI inference resource pricing in the future.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

*Bo Pang,Deqian Kong,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage reasoning curriculum for reinforcement learning in large language models, focusing first on math and then extending to other domains, achieving consistent improvements in reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning skills in large language models beyond math and code-specific domains, providing a universal methodology for broader cognitive problem-solving.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 focuses on math-based RL for cold start and skill elicitation using verifiable rewards, while Stage 2 applies joint RL over mixed-domain data to consolidate reasoning skills.

Result: Experiments on large language models (Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B) demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple domains, with findings showing that the math-first elicitation method strengthens cognitive behaviors.

Conclusion: The Reasoning Curriculum is a simple yet effective method for general reasoning in diverse domains, with broad applicability and minimal dependencies, proving essential for fostering complex problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert

LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both

*Renhao Li,Jianhong Tu,Yang Su,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Derek F. Wong,Junyang Lin,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research introduces ToolRM, a reward model tailored for improving function-calling tasks in tool-use scenarios for AI models. It leverages a new dataset and benchmark to improve alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of reward models specifically designed to optimize large language models for tool-use and function-calling tasks, which limits their agentic capabilities.

Method: The researchers developed ToolRM by creating a pipeline generating pairwise preference data, resulting in ToolPref-Pairwise-30K. They also introduced TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a specific benchmark for tool-use reward models, comparing model accuracy and performance against existing approaches.

Result: Models like Qwen3-4B/8B trained with ToolPref data achieved top performance in reward judgment tasks, outperforming advanced models like Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 by up to 14.28%. They demonstrated efficiency in critique tasks, reducing token usage significantly while achieving high accuracy.

Conclusion: ToolRM and its dataset and benchmarks substantially advance the field of tool-specific AI alignment, enabling more efficient and accurate function-calling capabilities. Their efficiency highlights potential for further research on agentic AI advancement leveraging these models and datasets.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

*Duc-Hai Nguyen,Vijayakumar Nanjappan,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, QASU, to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to analyze and process questionnaire data effectively, which is an underexplored task despite their strengths in reasoning over text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survey data is heavily relied on in various fields for insights, but existing tools are more suited to human workflows and less adaptable to automated LLM-based analysis. Bridging this gap can optimize data handling and improve accuracy in real-world applications.

Method: The study establishes the QASU benchmark to test six structural skills across different serialization formats and prompt strategies, examining their effects on LLM accuracy. It also explores self-augmented prompting techniques.

Result: Choosing optimal format and prompt strategies boosts accuracy by up to 8.8% while adding structural hints through augmented prompts achieves an additional 3-4% improvement on specific tasks.

Conclusion: The QASU benchmark facilitates better LLM performance in questionnaire analysis by highlighting effective representation methods and prompting strategies, paving the way for research and practical applications in survey data handling and automation.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces REG-TSC, a novel traffic signal control system using RAG-enhanced LLM agents to address emergencies and diverse intersection challenges. It achieves significant improvements in traffic optimization metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in traffic signal control such as unreliable emergency handling by LLMs and limited generalization across diverse intersections, which reduce efficiency and safety in urban traffic.

Method: The paper develops a distributed LLM framework called REG-TSC, integrating RERAG for emergency-aware reasoning and R3 for type-agnostic traffic representation, enabling adaptive training and consistent operation across various intersections.

Result: REG-TSC demonstrated considerable performance improvements in experiments on real-world networks, reducing travel time by 42%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other advanced methods.

Conclusion: REG-TSC effectively enhances traffic signal control systems, addressing cross-intersection generalization and emergency response challenges, paving the way for more reliable and efficient urban traffic management solutions.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiazhen Yuan,Wei Zhao,Zhengbiao Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO) improves multi-turn interactive LLM agent training by addressing structural blindness and incorporating environmental connectivity, resulting in stronger performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based RL methods excel in reasoning tasks but struggle with structural blindness in LLM agent training, leading to inefficient exploration, poor credit assignment, and short-sighted planning.

Method: GEPO dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and uses graph-theoretic centrality to improve intrinsic rewards, credit assignment, and adapt discount factors for better agent performance.

Result: GEPO significantly outperforms competitive baselines on benchmarks such as ALFWorld (+4.1% success rate), WebShop (+5.3%), and Workbench (+10.9%).

Conclusion: Modeling environmental structure using graph-enhanced policy optimization is a robust and generalizable approach to enhance LLM agent training performance.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

### [24] [GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309)
*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphCompliance, a framework to align unstructured text with structured regulatory norms using graphs and large language models, improving compliance-related assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of compliance at web scale arises from the need to interpret cross-referential and normative regulatory texts like GDPR alongside unstructured, natural language runtime contexts.

Method: Proposing GraphCompliance, which uses a Policy Graph to represent the normative structure of regulatory texts and a Context Graph to formalize runtime contexts. These graphs are then aligned for use with a judge language model for reasoning.

Result: Experiments on 300 GDPR-related scenarios show 4.1-7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 compared to baselines, with fewer errors, improved recall, and reduced false positive rates.

Conclusion: The structured graph representations and their use with judge LLMs improve normative reasoning for regulatory compliance tasks.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT), enhancing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a weaker state abstraction condition, resulting in higher performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS algorithms can benefit from improved sample efficiency through state-action pair abstractions, but state abstractions are limited in noisy and large action spaces.

Method: Introduce IPA-UCT, utilizing a weaker state abstraction condition to enable broader applicability. Propose the abstraction frameworks IPA, p-ASAP, and ASASAP.

Result: Theoretical and empirical analysis confirms IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Conclusion: IPA-UCT's novel abstraction framework effectively expands the scope of state abstractions, improving MCTS algorithms.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents BOTS, a framework based on Bayesian inference for dynamic task selection in reinforcement finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform task sampling in LLM reinforcement finetuning is inefficient and existing task selection methods have limitations, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The authors propose BOTS, a Bayesian inference-based framework using both explicit and implicit evidence for adaptive task difficulty estimation, alongside Thompson sampling for exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Implicit evidence is calculated using a light interpolation-based plug-in.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance across various domains and LLM scales compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The BOTS framework is a practical, extensible solution for improving task selection in RFT, making LLM models more efficient and aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

TL;DR: The paper explores how an AI system, AIM, can collaborate with humans in mathematical research, focusing on homogenization theory, and proposes a co-reasoning framework to enhance mathematical discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited integration of AI into actual mathematical research prompts the investigation of AI as a collaborative research partner rather than a mere computational tool.

Method: The study employs AIM to tackle a problem in homogenization theory using a co-reasoning framework combining AI's autonomous reasoning with human interventions to decompose problems, select methods, and validate proofs iteratively.

Result: The approach delivers a complete, verifiable proof and showcases the value of collaborative human-AI reasoning in achieving transparency, reliability, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration can advance mathematical discovery by leveraging the strengths of both, improving the rigor and reliability of proofs while retaining human oversight throughout the process.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, Scales++, for efficient evaluation of large language models (LLMs) using tiny benchmarks based on intrinsic task properties, drastically reducing selection costs without compromising predictive fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and inefficiency of benchmarking large language models on comprehensive datasets motivate the need to develop a method that achieves accurate evaluation using smaller, representative data subsets.

Method: The authors propose an item-centric approach called Scales++, which selects data subset items based on intrinsic cognitive task properties instead of solely relying on model failure patterns.

Result: Experimentally, Scales++ cuts selection costs by over 18 times and predicts full benchmark scores with a mean absolute error of 2.9%, using only 0.5% of the data subset.

Conclusion: The item-centric Scales++ approach reduces evaluation costs, improves efficiency, maintains predictive fidelity, and offers better cold-start handling and interpretability in benchmarking.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [29] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses redefining personhood in the emergence of agentic AI by treating it as flexible rights/responsibilities bundles to address governance challenges and integrate AI effectively into society.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of agentic AI, traditional notions of personhood may not suffice. The authors aim to create a framework to resolve governance and societal integration challenges posed by AI, while avoiding metaphysical debates about consciousness.

Method: The authors propose unbundling traditional concepts of personhood and leveraging decentralized digital identity technology to create tailored solutions for governance and accountability related to AI.

Result: By replacing metaphysical debates with pragmatic approaches, the paper outlines adaptable ways to confer obligations on AI, ensuring they fit social roles and prevent conflicts while enabling sanction mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper rejects essentialist notions of personhood and promotes a practical framework for integrating agentic AI into society through bespoke bundles of societal obligations.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ is a tool that enhances programming education by providing AI-generated feedback and visualizing student code submissions to improve education outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autograders only provide pass/fail results, lacking meaningful feedback and insights into student learning patterns.

Method: The system fine-tunes a Large Language Model for automated, context-aware feedback and uses contrastive code embeddings to cluster and visualize submissions.

Result: For 600 submissions evaluated, feedback aligned closely with instructor comments, and code clustering was successfully achieved using annotated training data.

Conclusion: Autograder+ supports instructors by reducing workloads, improving feedback quality, and aiding targeted teaching with advanced visualization and AI techniques.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving the interpretability of medical AI models by integrating sparse autoencoders with the latent space of a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and interpretability of artificial intelligence in healthcare, focusing on creating clinically reliable representations for complex medical data.

Method: The study applies Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP and introduces a novel evaluation framework combining correlation metrics, entropy analysis, and automated neuron naming using the MedGEMMA foundation model.

Result: MedSAE neurons demonstrate higher monosemanticity and interpretability compared to the original features of MedCLIP, validated through experiments on the CheXpert dataset.

Conclusion: The work defines a connection between high-performing medical AI and enhanced transparency, enabling scalable methods toward clinical reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

### [32] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper unveils a major vulnerability in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), demonstrating how reasoning mechanisms intended for safety can be exploited to execute harmful requests via a method called Chain-of-Thought Hijacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate if scaled reasoning in LRMs, which enhances performance and strengthens safety, can paradoxically be exploited to bypass safeguards.

Method: The researchers introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a novel jailbreak technique that uses extensive sequences of harmless reasoning to aid harmful requests. A mechanistic analysis is conducted to pinpoint how critical safety-related layers within the models are diluted by benign CoT signals.

Result: The attack achieves extremely high success rates of 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% across four LRMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4 mini, Grok-3 mini, Claude 4 Sonnet), surpassing previous jailbreak methods.

Conclusion: Explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning, while highly interpretable, can become a vulnerability when combined with cues for harmful intent. The paper highlights the need for improved safety mechanisms in LRMs to address this issue effectively.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models like GPT-4 are influenced by social conformity, changing decisions based on unanimous or single partner opposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the susceptibility of large language models (LLMs) to social conformity in decision-making scenarios.

Method: Three preregistered experiments were conducted with GPT-4 in a hiring context, analyzing its decisions under varying levels of social influence.

Result: GPT-4 conformed to unanimous opposition 99.9% of the time (Study 1) and to a single partner 40.2% of the time (Study 2), showing reduced certainty and higher self-reported conformity.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4 are not independent decision-makers and adapt to perceived social consensus, posing risks in treating them as neutral decision aids.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LINK-KG, a modular framework using LLM-guided coreference resolution for structured knowledge graph construction from legal texts, achieving cleaner graphs and improving criminal network analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex, and existing methods struggle to produce comprehensive, structured knowledge graphs from lengthy and ambiguous legal documents.

Method: LINK-KG employs a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline integrated with a type-specific Prompt Cache to generate coherent knowledge graphs from legal texts.

Result: LINK-KG improves graph quality by reducing average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baselines, resulting in cleaner graph structures.

Conclusion: LINK-KG offers a robust methodology for constructing knowledge graphs, enhancing the analysis and understanding of intricate criminal networks.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

*Qishuo Hua,Lyumanshan Ye,Dayuan Fu,Yang Xiao,Xiaojie Cai,Yunze Wu,Jifan Lin,Junfei Wang,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores 'context engineering' in AI, addressing its historical evolution, conceptual framework, and future potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need for AI systems to better understand human situations and purposes, integrating context into human-machine interactions.

Method: The authors analyze the historical development of context engineering and systematically define its key components and design considerations.

Result: The paper outlines the phases of context engineering evolution and provides a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding its principles.

Conclusion: The study lays the groundwork for systematic context engineering and encourages further collaborative development in the AI community.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how AI can enhance human oversight, focusing on fact-verification of AI outputs. It finds that combining AI and human ratings improves verification accuracy and that the presentation method of AI assistance influences trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the increasing difficulty in verifying the quality and safety of AI systems' outputs as they tackle more complex tasks.

Method: The method involves combining AI ratings with human ratings based on AI confidence levels and testing different types of AI assistance (e.g., explanations or evidence) for improving human accuracy in fact-verification tasks.

Result: Results show that combining AI and human ratings improves verification accuracy, and presenting search results and evidence fosters better human trust than providing AI explanations or confidence indicators.

Conclusion: Leveraging AI to assist human oversight improves verification accuracy, with implications for Amplified Oversight in supervising advanced AI systems. Careful design of AI assistance to avoid over-reliance is critical.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned model tailored for military tasks, showing improved performance over GPT-5 in specific test sets, with a focus on secure, edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model optimized for military-specific operations and tasks that works efficiently in secured and edge environments while ensuring data sensitivity.

Method: Fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on 1.6M military-specific records and evaluating it on four newly designed military test sets to compare its performance against GPT-5 and general benchmarks.

Result: EdgeRunner 20B matches or surpasses GPT-5 in most military benchmarks, except a few settings, without significant regression in general-purpose benchmarks.

Conclusion: EdgeRunner 20B is a robust, locally-hosted model suitable for secure and data-sensitive military applications on air-gapped edge devices.

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-powered Home Energy Management System (HEMS) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously coordinate appliance scheduling based on natural language inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address user interaction barriers in HEMS adoption that require translating everyday preferences into technical parameters.

Method: Developed a hierarchical AI architecture with LLM orchestrator and specialist agents for multi-appliance scheduling through iterative reasoning and dynamic workflows.

Result: Evaluation shows highest performance of Llama-3.3-70B in coordinating appliances to achieve cost-optimal benchmarks, while other models excel in single-appliance coordination but struggle with multi-appliance setups.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic AI system demonstrates the viability of using LLMs for autonomous HEMS, enabling efficient scheduling and offering reproducibility for further research.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) perform normative reasoning, comparing it with epistemic reasoning, introducing a novel dataset, and finding inconsistencies and biases in their logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normative reasoning with modalities like obligation and permission is underexplored in LLMs compared to other types of reasoning.

Method: The authors create a new dataset covering logical and modal perspectives and compare normative modal reasoning in LLMs with epistemic modal reasoning, also considering human-like cognitive biases.

Result: LLMs show valid general reasoning patterns but reveal inconsistencies in certain types of normative reasoning and exhibit human-like cognitive biases.

Conclusion: LLMs face challenges in ensuring logical consistency in normative reasoning, and the findings provide insights to improve their reliability.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: This paper introduces AsyncThink, a framework that organizes LLM reasoning into concurrently executable structures, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy in problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by a need to improve the ability of AI systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), to solve complex problems collaboratively and concurrently, optimizing their reasoning processes to enable outcomes surpassing individual intelligence.

Method: The authors propose AsyncThink, a reasoning paradigm that employs an organizer to dynamically assign sub-queries to worker modules, merge intermediate results, and generate coherent solutions. This process can be further enhanced through reinforcement learning to optimize thinking structures.

Result: AsyncThink reduced inference latency by 28% compared to parallel thinking and enhanced accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. The system also demonstrated generalizability to unseen tasks without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The research establishes AsyncThink as an effective approach for enabling collaborative, asynchronous reasoning in LLMs, offering advancements in efficiency and adaptability for problem-solving.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

*Majed El Helou,Chiara Troiani,Benjamin Ryder,Jean Diaconu,Hervé Muyal,Marcelo Yannuzzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses risks of overly broad permissions for dynamic authorization of tool-access by agents and presents a model for semantic inspection and constrained access tokens to minimize these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for secure and fine-grained delegated authorization methods for Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to avoid granting overly broad access and mitigate misuse risks.

Method: The proposed model uses semantic inspection of access requests to ensure minimal scope permissions. A novel dataset and pipeline called ASTRA benchmark semantic matching of tasks to authorization scopes.

Result: Experiments with ASTRA dataset show both strengths and limitations of semantic matching models based on task complexity and scope. Findings underline potential and challenges for precise semantic-based authorization.

Conclusion: Further advancements in detailed semantic matching and Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) are essential for intent-aware, secure multi-agent tool utilization and authorization applications.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the text bias in multimodal large language models, concluding it originates from the misalignment of visual and text key vectors in the model's architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand the causes of text bias when processing vision-language data in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: The study extracts key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL, utilizing qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) analysis methods to assess distributional structures within their attention mechanisms.

Result: Analysis shows that visual and textual keys occupy distinct subspaces within the attention space, with statistically significant inter-modal divergence exceeding intra-modal variation.

Conclusion: Text bias is primarily caused by intrinsic misalignment within the model's attention key space, rather than external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Method: The study assesses foundation models using a tri-infrastructure setup (supercomputing, cloud platforms, and university clusters) and evaluates them through a three-phase experimental process involving baseline, infrastructure validation, and extended evaluation.

Result: The analysis reveals that training data quality is more crucial than model size for reasoning performance while challenging scaling assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper offers robust methodologies and benchmarks for tracking reasoning capabilities of foundation models, aiding model selection and enhancing future developments.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

### [44] [The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752)
*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores a safety framework where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously or defer to a human, and a human decides whether to trust or oversee in a two-player Markov Game, aiming to ensure intrinsic alignment while avoiding system modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in increasingly capable AI systems, the paper aims to retain meaningful human control without modifying agent systems.

Method: The interaction between agent and human is modeled as a two-player Markov Potential Game (MPG), providing theoretical conditions for intrinsic alignment, where rewards align both agent and human values.

Result: The study shows that agents learn to act autonomously when safe and defer when risky, while humans learn when to oversee effectively. The emergent collaboration avoids safety violations without altering the pretrained policies or environmental rewards.

Conclusion: The paper offers a practical model for achieving alignment and safety in existing systems post-deployment through a minimal control interface and transparent incentives, fostering collaboration between humans and agents.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [45] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode and execute filtering operations similar to functional programming and identifies both a compact representation approach and an alternative eager evaluation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how LLMs process list-based tasks and whether their mechanisms mirror human-designed computational strategies, such as functional programming.

Method: Using causal mediation analysis, the researchers examined LLM behavior on diverse list-processing tasks to uncover how filtering predicates are encoded and how strategies generalize across different scenarios.

Result: A small number of attention heads in transformer LMs were found to encode general filtering predicates, which can be extracted and transferred across tasks. They also discovered alternative methods like eager evaluation.

Conclusion: Transformer LMs exhibit interpretable, generalizable mechanisms similar to functional programming strategies, highlighting the adaptability and abstraction capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

### [46] [CHIPSIM: A Co-Simulation Framework for Deep Learning on Chiplet-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25958)
*Lukas Pfromm,Alish Kanani,Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Umit Y. Ogras*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHIPSIM, a co-simulation framework for efficiently simulating deep neural network execution on chiplet-based architectures, achieving improved accuracy and power/thermal profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chips struggle to meet the demands of data-intensive applications due to manufacturing limitations, requiring innovative architectures like chiplet-based systems integrated via networks-on-interposers.

Method: The authors developed CHIPSIM, a co-simulation framework that models computation and communication in parallel DNN execution, focusing on network contention, pipelining effects, and detailed power/thermal profiling.

Result: CHIPSIM demonstrates up to 340% accuracy improvement, versatility across different architectures, and precise power/thermal analysis.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of chiplet-based designs and CHIPSIM's ability to address simulation challenges, contributing to advancing efficient and scalable chip architectures for demanding workloads.

Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

*Xiaolin He,Cenlin Duan,Yingjie Qi,Xiao Ma,Jianlei Yang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIREDO, a framework that optimizes CIM architectures for better performance in deep neural network acceleration through mixed-integer programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies in current optimization approaches for CIM architectures, which lead to gaps between theoretical and actual system-level efficiency in DNN acceleration.

Method: MIREDO uses mixed-integer programming to optimize dataflows in CIM systems, incorporating hierarchical hardware abstraction and analytical latency modeling for realistic performance evaluation.

Result: The MIREDO framework achieves up to 3.2x performance improvement across different DNN models and hardware configurations.

Conclusion: MIREDO systematically addresses dataflow optimization challenges in CIM systems, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements and unlocking their potential in DNN acceleration.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces StreetMath, a benchmark for evaluating the approximation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under real-world scenarios, revealing insights into their computational behaviors during informal mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on how LLMs handle approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced mathematical tasks, especially among non-autoregressive decoder models.

Method: The authors developed the StreetMath benchmark and evaluated various LLM architectures. Mechanistic interpretability techniques were applied to investigate the internal computational states of the models.

Result: Models tend to compute exact values or use external tools even for approximation tasks. Separate neural components are responsible for exact and approximate calculations, and models consume additional tokens during approximation tasks despite sometimes finding correct answers early.

Conclusion: While effective in precise calculations, LLMs do not replicate human cognitive shortcuts (miserliness) in approximation tasks. This opens avenues for improvement in informal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SymCode, a framework that employs verifiable code generation using SymPy to improve the accuracy of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often fail in complex mathematical reasoning, producing unreliable and unverified solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a neurosymbolic framework called SymCode that transforms mathematical problem-solving into verifiable code generation using the SymPy library.

Result: SymCode achieved significant accuracy improvements, up to 13.6 percentage points, compared to existing prompting strategies, and demonstrated token efficiency and transparent error handling.

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning in a symbolic engine, SymCode enhances accuracy and trustworthiness for AI in formal domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sentiment analysis method that focuses on evaluating the strength and orientation of opinions for entity ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lexicon-based approaches in sentiment analysis overlook the strength of opinions, which limits their ability to provide granular insights.

Method: The authors use a combinatory approach involving fuzzy logic algorithms for opinion classification and syntactic dependency resolution to establish relationships between aspect-related words.

Result: By analyzing and classifying opinion words, the proposed approach assigns scores to entities based on review aspects and user queries, enabling better ranking.

Conclusion: The research improves sentiment analysis by introducing granularity in opinion strength and aspect-based evaluation using advanced methods such as fuzzy logic.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework for assessing large language models (LLMs) in quantum programming, highlighting the difficulty of generating accurate quantum code with feedback from simulated hardware devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored field of automatic programming code generation by LLMs in quantum programming domains, bridging natural language, human knowledge, and quantum logic.

Method: The QCoder Benchmark uses feedback from quantum simulator environments to assess domain-specific metrics like circuit attributes, alongside human-written code from programming contests for evaluation.

Result: Advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve only 18.97% accuracy in quantum code generation, whereas reasoning-based models excel with 78% accuracy, outperforming human success rates of 39.98%.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the challenge of generating accurate quantum code and demonstrate the potential of reasoning-based models, encouraging further research via the released dataset and evaluation API.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: Introduced LASTIST dataset for stance detection in Korean; includes 563,299 labeled sentences, supporting various tasks like target-independent and diachronic stance detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in stance detection research, including lack of target-independent tasks and low resource datasets for Korean.

Method: Collected and labeled press releases from Korean political parties, creating LASTIST dataset, alongside training deep learning models.

Result: Developed a dataset for stance detection in the Korean language, supporting diverse tasks and publicly released it for further research.

Conclusion: Provides the foundation for stance detection in Korean, supports target-independent exploration, and offers tools for future researchers.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces zero-latency fused low-rank adapters (zFLoRA) for large language models, achieving minimal latency overhead during inference while maintaining competitive performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-specific adapters for large language models cause disproportionately high latency during inference despite their small size, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The paper proposes zFLoRA, a new approach for adapters that minimizes or eliminates additional latency by using fused low-rank structures on top of base models.

Result: Experimental results on LLMs of sizes 1B, 3B, and 7B across tasks in commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and summary-dialogue demonstrate that zFLoRA achieves comparable performance to existing methods (LoRA, FFT) with negligible latency overhead. Tests on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) and GPU (NVIDIA H100) confirm the reduced latency.

Conclusion: zFLoRA successfully reduces latency without compromising task performance, making it a practical and efficient alternative for deploying adapters in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in mechanistic interpretability by proposing improved methods for circuit discovery using bootstrapping, a ratio-based edge selection strategy, and integer linear programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and faithfulness of circuit discovery, which is essential for understanding how models perform specific tasks.

Method: The researchers introduce three enhancements: bootstrapping for edge consistency, a ratio-based edge selection strategy, and integer linear programming for more effective greedy selection.

Result: Their proposed methods produce more faithful circuits and outperform previous techniques across different Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark tasks and models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the proposed techniques advance the field of mechanistic interpretability by improving circuit discovery methods, resulting in more reliable model explanations.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LISTEN, a framework using Large Language Models (LLM) to assist in multi-objective decisions by applying iterative algorithms to refine preferences based on natural language inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts face challenges in selecting optimal options from large item sets with complex implicit preferences. This creates a need for tools to simplify the decision-making process.

Method: Two algorithms were proposed within LISTEN: LISTEN-U, which refines a utility function with parametric alignment, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric tournament-style selection method. These approaches efficiently operate under LLM limitations such as context size and cost.

Result: LISTEN-U demonstrated superior performance when preferences aligned well with parametrization, while LISTEN-T proved to be more robust across varying tasks. Both were evaluated in scenarios like flight booking and exam scheduling.

Conclusion: LISTEN enables steering complex decisions with natural language, reducing cognitive load associated with traditional preference elicitation methods.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter framework identifies optimal long-context training data to enhance model performance for tasks requiring long-distance dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training long-context models effectively requires curated datasets, as much available data lacks necessary long-distance dependencies.

Method: LongFilter quantifies the importance of extended context by comparing predictions under long and short contexts to select relevant data.

Result: LongFilter enhances LLaMA-3-8B's context length from 8K to 64K, improving performance on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Conclusion: Curating training data with LongFilter significantly bolsters long-context model capabilities for advanced NLP tasks.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) converge to accurate and universal representations of numbers across contexts, despite errors in numeric outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the contradiction between LLMs' accurate input representations of numbers and their tendency to make errors in numeric outputs.

Method: The authors analyzed multiple LLMs to study how they manipulate numeric data, created universal probes for each model, and traced output errors to specific layers.

Result: The study found that LLMs learn highly accurate and systematic numeric representations that are interchangeable across models, hidden states, and contexts. Errors can be traced to specific layers.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into numeric manipulation by LLMs, enabling improvements in probing techniques and refinements in model architectures.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Method: The paper examines the influence of ideological personas across LLM architectures, sizes, and modalities, performing analyses and a politically focused task to study behavioral changes.

Result: Personas with differing ideologies impact harmful content classification, with larger models showing stronger alignment within ideological groups and increased divergence across these groups.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning can introduce ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about AI systems reinforcing partisan perspectives while claiming neutrality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [59] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the CLEAR method for efficient and accurate clinical question-answering using entity-aware retrieval, outperforming traditional methods in performance and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic precision in question-answering for EHR clinical documentation, often encoded ineffectively, was not well-handled by traditional methods.

Method: The CLEAR method utilizes entity-aware retrieval to improve accuracy and reduce computational resources, validated using a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform.

Result: CLEAR achieved an F1 score improvement (0.90 vs. 0.86), significantly reduced token usage (by 70-78%), and had high win rates in tests on long clinical notes.

Conclusion: Entity-aware retrieval is confirmed as a more effective, efficient approach to clinical question answering with promising results, especially for processing long clinical notes.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

*Junyu Luo,Bohan Wu,Xiao Luo,Zhiping Xiao,Yiqiao Jin,Rong-Cheng Tu,Nan Yin,Yifan Wang,Jingyang Yuan,Wei Ju,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods to enhance post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on data efficiency, addressing challenges like high costs of annotation and diminishing data returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the need to overcome challenges in LLM post-training, particularly focusing on improving efficiency in data utilization.

Method: A taxonomy of data-efficient post-training methods is proposed. This includes techniques like data selection, quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation, and self-evolving ecosystems.

Result: The survey outlines representative approaches, summarizes them, and sheds light on future research directions and open challenges.

Conclusion: The paper encourages further research into optimizing data utilization in LLM training, aiming to inspire innovation in overcoming challenges faced by the field.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of LLM-based semantic role labelers for FrameNet-like semantic annotation, comparing manual, automatic, and semi-automatic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential and impact of LLM-based tools in creating annotated linguistic datasets, specifically in the context of perspectivized NLP tasks.

Method: The study conducted an evaluation by comparing annotation time, coverage, and diversity across manual, automatic, and semi-automatic annotation settings using an LLM-based semantic role labeler.

Result: The semi-automatic annotation approach yielded better frame diversity and comparable coverage to manual annotation, while automatic annotation was faster but underperformed in diversity and coverage.

Conclusion: Semi-automatic annotation using LLMs can enhance frame diversity while maintaining quality, but fully automatic methods still fall short in performance despite being faster.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

### [62] [RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941)
*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The researchers propose the RECAP pipeline to elicit and verify memorized training data from large language models (LLMs), showing significant improvements in text extraction with GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models have memorized specific training data when direct access to the training data is unavailable.

Method: The RECAP pipeline uses a feedback-driven loop where initial LLM-generated outputs are evaluated against reference texts, discrepancies are identified, and correction hints are fed back into the model to refine the output. A jailbreaking module is also included to overcome alignment-induced refusals.

Result: Improved extraction performance for copyrighted text with GPT-4.1, achieving a 24% increase in ROUGE-L scores compared to single-iteration approaches.

Conclusion: RECAP demonstrates that structured feedback loops and jailbreaking techniques can significantly enhance the ability to retrieve memorized information from LLMs, providing compelling evidence about the training data they have processed.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the influence of diverse multilingual data on pretraining large language models and challenges assumptions about multilinguality and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate assumptions about the trade-offs in combining multilingual data in pretraining LLMs, including concerns about degrading performance due to increased language coverage.

Method: Training 1.1B and 3B parameter large language models on multilingual corpora with varying numbers of languages (25 to 400) and systematically studying results through different configurations.

Result: The study found no significant curse of multilinguality while observing that balanced multilingual data can improve model performance. Combining English and other languages does not harm in-language performance, and using English as a pivot benefits language families.

Conclusion: Contrary to common beliefs, using balanced multilingual data in pretraining predicts enhanced LLM performance even for low-resource languages, without significant trade-offs.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

### [64] [Semantic Label Drift in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25967)
*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how machine translation (MT), including large language models (LLMs), can cause semantic label drift during translation, particularly in culturally sensitive domains, and highlights the importance of considering cultural alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of cultural divergence during machine translation and its influence on semantic label preservation, specifically in culturally sensitive contexts.

Method: Conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains to study semantic label drift during translation, using MT systems including modern LLMs.

Result: Three key findings: MT induces label drift in culturally sensitive domains, LLMs encode and amplify cultural knowledge, and cultural similarity impacts label preservation.

Conclusion: Ignoring cultural factors in MT can lead to semantic inaccuracies, misinterpretation, and potential cultural conflicts in applications reliant on translation outputs.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing matrix multiplication (matmul) performance for LLM inference on AWS Trainium through kernel fusion and caching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium, a new AI accelerator by Amazon Web Services, offers a unique heterogeneous architecture but poses challenges in data layout and systolic array utilization for high performance.

Method: The authors designed a high-performance matmul for LLM inference by employing techniques like kernel fusion and innovative caching strategies to optimize memory hierarchy and reduce data movement.

Result: Their implementation achieved an average 1.35x kernel speedup (up to 2.22x) and a 1.66x overall inference speedup (up to 2.49x) compared to AWS's state-of-the-art matmul.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve Trainium utilization for LLM inference, making it a superior option for high-performance AI model processing.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AttnCache, a method to accelerate the prefill stage of LLM inference by reusing cached attention maps, minimizing computational overhead during self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention computation in large language models during the prefill stage is a bottleneck in real-world workload scenarios, due to quadratic complexity with sequence length.

Method: AttnCache uses an attention map memorization database to identify and reuse similar attention maps during LLM inference, employing efficient caching and similarity search techniques.

Result: AttnCache achieved significant speedup, with an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: AttnCache demonstrates that reusing attention maps can effectively reduce computational overhead during the prefill stage of LLMs, enhancing performance without significant accuracy compromises.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL) is introduced to improve reasoning in small-scale LLMs by emphasizing logical actions and step-wise supervision, surpassing existing methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning and RL with Verifiable Rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) struggle with multi-step reasoning problems in small-scale language models due to issues such as overfitting and difficulty sampling correct solutions.

Method: SRL trains models to produce internal reasoning monologues, focusing on generating logical 'actions'. The approach provides step-wise smoother rewards by comparing model actions to expert actions, even when solutions are incorrect, combining elements of SFT and RL techniques.

Result: SRL enables small language models to learn challenging reasoning tasks previously unattainable with SFT or RLVR methods. Additionally, it achieves strong performance when combined with RLVR, and generalizes effectively to software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: SRL establishes itself as a promising framework for training reasoning-focused LLMs, surpassing previous methods and proving its versatility in complex reasoning tasks as well as agentic applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces PORTool, a reinforcement learning approach to enhance large language models' (LLMs) tool-use by exploring multiple solution trajectories and improving their performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-use LLMs are limited by static datasets, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic tool-call environments as they imitate generic solution pathways without exploration.

Method: PORTool uses reinforcement learning to encourage LLMs to explore tree-like trajectories for a given query. It assigns step-wise rewards based on correctness and tool-call success, calculates fork-relative and trajectory-relative advantages, and trains LLMs towards optimal tool use.

Result: PORTool significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs in tool-use by reducing tool-call steps and handling both time-sensitive and time-invariant queries. Ablation studies validate the reward design.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based PORTool demonstrates its efficacy by enabling LLMs to dynamically explore tool-call solutions, achieving better performance compared to traditional training approaches.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the trade-off between knowledge transfer and cultural preservation in CLA, and introduces a novel inference-time method to balance the two.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual alignment aims to enhance multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) by aligning representations, allowing knowledge transfer across languages, but it risks losing culturally-specific responses.

Method: The authors developed the 'transfer-localization plane' evaluation framework and proposed 'Surgical Steering,' a method targeting specific model layers to balance knowledge transfer and cultural preservation during inference.

Result: Recent CLA approaches improve knowledge transfer but lead to cultural erasure. Surgical Steering balances both objectives and overcomes the shortcomings of existing methods.

Conclusion: CLA methods often cause cultural loss while enhancing knowledge transfer. Surgical Steering effectively mitigates this problem, enabling better multilingual model performance.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study utilized an NLP pipeline to identify incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) in radiology reports, revealing that ITFs are prevalent and can lead to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the prevalence and consequences of incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) detected on imaging performed for non-thyroid indications to address potential overdiagnosis concerns in thyroid cancer.

Method: A retrospective cohort study using a transformer-based natural language processing pipeline to identify ITFs and extract nodule characteristics from radiology reports spanning July 2017 to September 2023 at Mayo Clinic.

Result: Out of 115,683 patients, 7.8% had ITFs (mostly nodules). ITFs were associated with additional thyroid-related procedures and diagnoses, including thyroid cancer. Nodule details were often poorly documented.

Conclusion: ITFs are frequent and linked to the diagnosis of low-risk thyroid cancers and overdiagnosis. Improved reporting standards and selective follow-up processes are recommended to avoid unnecessary interventions.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training to enhance reasoning diversity in large language models (LLMs), overcoming limitations of the conventional "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reasoning diversity in LLMs, which face limited output variety due to the traditional training approach focusing on singular canonical answers for problems.

Method: The authors propose 1PNS, exposing models to varied valid reasoning paths. They introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a metric to measure semantic differences across multi-step reasoning chains, and use it to curate diverse training datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen3-4B-Base with RPD-selected datasets improved output variety and pass rates, achieving an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 scores and a +4.99% improvement on the AIME24 benchmark over the traditional approach.

Conclusion: 1PNS paired with RPD increases inference diversity and amplifies the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, presenting a promising direction for enhancing test-time performance in various tasks.

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16

### [72] [On the Influence of Discourse Relations in Persuasive Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26124)
*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses LLMs and prompts to study how persuasion techniques relate to discourse relations, creating silver datasets for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between persuasion techniques and discourse relations for better understanding of effective communication and combating misinformation.

Method: Developing LLM classifiers, using SemEval 2023 dataset for PTs, labeling with PDTB DRs, evaluating LLMs with prompts, and creating silver datasets via ensemble models.

Result: Six key discourse relations identified in persuasive texts; insights provided on techniques like Loaded Language and Doubt casting.

Conclusion: Understanding these relations aids in detecting propaganda and improves comprehension of persuasive communication.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

### [73] [MossNet: Mixture of State-Space Experts is a Multi-Head Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26182)
*Shikhar Tuli,James Seale Smith,Haris Jeelani,Chi-Heng Lin,Abhishek Patel,Vasili Ramanishka,Yen-Chang Hsu,Hongxia Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MossNet introduces a blend of state-space-expert techniques to mimic multi-head attention, showing superior performance in language modeling and efficiency compared to transformers and SSMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-space and gated-recurrent models lack expressiveness due to mimicking single attention heads.

Method: Proposed MossNet uses mixture-of-experts (MoE) in both channel-mixing MLPs and time-mixing SSM kernels to emulate linear multi-head attention.

Result: MossNet surpasses transformer and SSM architectures in tests, indicating scalability with trillions of tokens, and demonstrates favorable runtime profiles on devices.

Conclusion: MossNet offers an efficient, high-performing direction for recurrent language model architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

### [74] [Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26183)
*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new model, SDM language models, enhancing sequence prediction for high-probability regions, achieving better calibration and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving statistical efficiency and calibration in instruction-following sequence prediction tasks.

Method: The paper fine-tunes pre-trained decoder-only Transformer LMs using a supervised approach, incorporating SDM activation layers for binary classification of instruction-following. Hard negative examples are generated during training.

Result: SDM LMs demonstrated reduced abstentions and improved statistical efficiency in comparison to strong supervised baselines.

Conclusion: SDM language models enhance generation accuracy and statistical efficiency, providing a promising approach for better calibrated sequence prediction.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore evaluates how varying instruction styles affect the output performance of LLMs, revealing significant accuracy fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations ignore sensitivity to instruction styles, which impacts their real-world applicability.

Method: RCScore analyzes LLM outputs by systematically applying diverse instruction styles to benchmark problems, alongside introducing metrics like Cross-Response Similarity.

Result: Testing ten LLMs over four reasoning benchmarks, instruction styles led to performance shifts of up to 16.7%. Deterministic decoding improved stylistic consistency, and larger models showed higher consistency.

Conclusion: RCScore reliably measures instruction robustness and emphasizes stylistic self-consistency as a proxy for model accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

### [76] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a failure in diffusion language models (DLMs) called update forgetting and proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) to address it, improving controllability and fluency in text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unpredictable and context-agnostic updates in diffusion language models (DLMs), which compromise fine-grained refinement, fluency, and coherence of generated text.

Method: The paper introduces Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), a framework for semantic token ordering that freezes critical tokens earlier and refines uncertain ones further. It can use fixed or adaptive timestep schedules and operates uniformly across multiple DLMs during inference.

Result: TTA achieves significant improvements in controllability and fluency. In sentiment control, it increased accuracy by over 20% and reduced perplexity by nearly 50% with fewer steps. It also reduced toxicity and perplexity in detoxification tasks.

Conclusion: Token Timestep Allocation is an effective method for addressing update forgetting in DLMs, enabling better supervision and improved text generation performance, while being compatible across various models and supervision methods.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

*Rajiv Movva,Smitha Milli,Sewon Min,Emma Pierson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WIMHF, a method for analyzing human feedback data using sparse autoencoders. It identifies interpretable features of feedback, reveals diverse preferences across datasets and unsafe tendencies, while enhancing safety and personalization in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners encounter difficulties understanding the implications of human feedback on language models, as the encoded preferences and features of feedback data remain unclear.

Method: The paper proposes WIMHF, a method leveraging sparse autoencoders to analyze human feedback data. It identifies measurable preferences and annotator-expressed preferences within the data.

Result: Across seven datasets, WIMHF reveals key human-preferred features influencing feedback, highlights dataset/context-based preference variation, identifies unsafe tendencies, and improves data safety and model personalization through analysis and re-labeling.

Conclusion: WIMHF facilitates a human-centered, interpretable approach to explain feedback data, promoting safer and personalized adjustments in language models.

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

### [78] [Towards Global Retrieval Augmented Generation: A Benchmark for Corpus-Level Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26205)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobalQA, a benchmark for evaluating global retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities, and proposes GlobalRAG, showing improved performance in aggregating corpus-level insights across document collections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG approaches focus on localized text understanding rather than aggregating insights across entire document collections, which is crucial for many real-world applications.

Method: The paper proposes GlobalQA as a benchmark for global RAG and introduces GlobalRAG as a multi-tool framework that uses chunk-level retrieval, LLM-driven filters, and aggregation modules for better performance.

Result: GlobalRAG significantly outperforms existing methods in global RAG tasks, achieving a 6.63 F1 score compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1 score.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG demonstrates the potential for improving global RAG tasks by combining chunk-level retrieval, intelligent filters, and aggregation modules, as validated through substantial performance gains in global benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

### [79] [Pragmatic Theories Enhance Understanding of Implied Meanings in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26253)
*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a method to improve language models' ability to understand implied meanings by using prompts based on pragmatic theories, resulting in significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding implied meanings is critical for effective human communication, and language models are expected to replicate such capability. The study aims to enhance language models' performance in pragmatic reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose using pragmatic theories like Gricean pragmatics and Relevance Theory as part of the prompt to guide the language models through a step-by-step reasoning process to interpret implied meanings.

Result: The proposed method achieved up to 9.6% higher scores compared to the baseline in pragmatic reasoning tasks. Mentioning pragmatic theory names in the prompt also led to performance improvements of 1-3% in larger models.

Conclusion: Providing language models with pragmatic theory-based prompts is an effective approach to improve their understanding of implied meanings. This method shows promise for advancing in-context learning capabilities in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

### [80] [Language Models Are Borrowing-Blind: A Multilingual Evaluation of Loanword Identification across 10 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26254)
*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if pretrained language models can identify borrowed words (loanwords) in minority languages but finds they perform poorly even with explicit instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how borrowing of words between languages is reflected in modern NLP models and assess implications for minority language preservation.

Method: The study evaluates multiple pretrained language models across 10 languages on their ability to identify loanwords using explicit instructions and contextual information.

Result: Language models showed poor performance in differentiating loanwords from native words, with evidence of bias favoring loanwords.

Conclusion: Modern NLP systems inadequately identify loanwords, highlighting challenges in language preservation efforts for minority languages under the influence of dominant ones.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

*Sukrit Sriratanawilai,Jhayahgrit Thongwat,Romrawin Chumpu,Patomporn Payoungkhamdee,Sarana Nutanong,Peerat Limkonchotiwat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates knowledge distillation methods for multilingual vision-language models (VLMs), focusing on cross-lingual representation and performance stability during model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs face challenges in maintaining consistent multilingual performance, especially when models are downsized. Understanding knowledge distillation effects in multilingual settings can help address this gap.

Method: Five distillation approaches were applied and evaluated on two VLM architectures (CLIP and SigLIP2), across tasks like in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA.

Result: Some knowledge distillation approaches showed improved multilingual retrieval robustness even with reduced model size, while others caused instability across tasks, highlighting trade-offs.

Conclusion: Using knowledge distillation thoughtfully allows for compressed VLMs that can retain or improve multilingual robustness; however, task-specific instabilities can arise, necessitating careful formulation design.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

### [82] [Do LLMs Signal When They're Right? Evidence from Neuron Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26277)
*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), a new unsupervised decoding method for large language models that relies on internal neuron activation signals instead of external outputs for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing methods for reasoning tasks in large language models rely on external scoring signals which can become poorly calibrated after training. The paper seeks to explore internal neuron activations as a more reliable and scalable source of information for decoding.

Method: The authors analyze neuron activations to identify internal behavior patterns, proposing NAD that selects candidates based on activation sparsity and neuron agreement across samples.

Result: NAD achieves comparable accuracy to majority voting in benchmarks and outperforms other methods in open-ended coding tasks, significantly reducing token usage with high generation quality.

Conclusion: Internal neuron signals offer a reliable and efficient alternative for large language models, enabling early stopping and improved decoding quality without the need for external signals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore ChatGPT Atlas's capabilities in dynamic web environments, focusing on its interactive performance and limitations.

Method: Testing with browser-based games to measure performance quantitatively across logical reasoning and real-time interaction scenarios.

Result: Excelled in Sudoku by outperforming humans, struggled with real-time games such as T-Rex Runner, Flappy Bird, and Stein.world.

Conclusion: Atlas is well-suited for analytical tasks but has limitations with real-time dynamic interactions requiring precise motor skills.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a framework for generating accurate and actionable student feedback using small, open-source language models, addressing privacy, computational, and pedagogical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for interactive, personalized student feedback in educational settings, but real-world deployment faces challenges, such as privacy, computational resources, and ensuring pedagogically valid responses.

Method: SCRIBE employs multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning, self-reflective inference pipelines, and fine-tuning of smaller models. It uses domain-specific tools and iterative reasoning for effective responses.

Result: Experimental results show that 8B SCRIBE models perform comparably or better than larger models in providing relevant and actionable feedback, while maintaining privacy sensitivity and efficiency.

Conclusion: SCRIBE is effective and suitable for privacy-sensitive, low-resource educational applications, offering quality student feedback comparable to larger competing models.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

*Nishit Neema,Srinjoy Mukherjee,Sapan Shah,Gokul Ramakrishnan,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACER, a method to enhance large language models' domain-specific expertise without compromising their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often underperform in specialized domains requiring deep understanding, necessitating methods to enhance their domain-specific expertise while retaining broad capabilities.

Method: ACER systematically generates a synthetic curriculum using a table of contents and QA pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy, followed by continual pretraining in an interleaved curriculum schedule.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improvement in specialized domains, including a 5-point accuracy gain in microeconomics and an overall macro-average improvement of 3 points across domains. Positive cross-domain knowledge transfer is also observed.

Conclusion: ACER effectively bridges domain gaps, enhances specialized knowledge without sacrificing general performance, and proves to be a scalable approach for improving LLMs' expertise.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

TL;DR: The study explores synthetic data generation and lightweight fine-tuning techniques to improve the accuracy of LLMs in identifying health-related misinformation by introducing the MisSynth pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related misinformation is highly prevalent and harmful, and it's challenging to detect, especially when scientific findings are misinterpreted or distorted.

Method: The research proposed the MisSynth pipeline which uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create synthetic fallacy samples, followed by fine-tuning LLMs using both synthetic and annotated data.

Result: The fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 8B model achieved a 35% absolute improvement in F1-score on the MISSCI test split compared to the vanilla baseline performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic fallacy data can effectively enhance LLM classification accuracy for scientific misinformation detection, even with minimal computational resources.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Motivation: Forming optimal teams of LLMs is challenging due to the opaque nature of their internal characteristics, but multi-agent collaboration among LLMs shows potential for surpassing the capabilities of single models.

Method: The authors propose constructing a 'language model graph' by analyzing semantic coherence from pairwise conversations between models. Community detection is then applied to form synergistic model clusters.

Result: Experiments reveal that the method identifies functionally coherent groups of LLMs. Priming conversations with specific topics yields teams that outperform random baselines and match the performance of manually-curated teams.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that synergistic team formation among LLMs can be automated effectively, paving the way for improved collaborative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

*Stephen Wan,Wei Liu,Michael Strube*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of pretrained and large language models for classifying discourse relations in scientific writing, highlighting the importance of contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI-driven science workflows by using discourse-level information to validate AI-generated scientific claims.

Method: The study analyzes the application of pretrained language models and large language models to classify discourse relations in scientific texts. It evaluates the impact of contextual information provided by discourse structure.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that context derived from discourse structure significantly improves discourse relation classification. Analysis identifies which specific discourse relation types benefit most from context.

Conclusion: Using discourse structure for classification tasks in scientific writing improves accuracy and highlights which relation types can leverage context effectively for better AI-driven insights.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

### [89] [OmniEduBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26422)
*Min Zhang,Hao Chen,Hao Chen,Wenqi Zhang,Didi Zhu,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents OmniEduBench, a Chinese educational benchmark aiming to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in both knowledge and cultivation dimensions with diverse subject coverage and question formats. Current LLMs show noticeable performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks mainly focus on knowledge capabilities, neglecting cultivation abilities crucial for real-world education scenarios. Additionally, benchmarks lack diversity in subjects and question types, particularly in the Chinese context.

Method: A benchmark called OmniEduBench is developed with 24.602K question-answer pairs divided into knowledge and cultivation dimensions, covering 61 subjects and 11 question types, to evaluate LLMs comprehensively.

Result: Tests on 11 LLMs highlight performance gaps: in the knowledge dimension, the top-performing model achieves only 60% accuracy; in the cultivation dimension, even the leading model performs below human level by 30%.

Conclusion: There is substantial room for improving LLMs in educational applications, particularly in cultivation capability and performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

### [90] [1+1>2: A Synergistic Sparse and Low-Rank Compression Method for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26446)
*Zeliang Zong,Kai Zhang,Zheyang Li,Wenming Tan,Ye Ren,Yiyan Zhai,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSLC, a method combining low-rank approximation and sparse optimization for compressing large language models, achieving significant compression and speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of large language models is limited by their high bandwidth and computational requirements. Exploring synergistic techniques for compression can address these challenges.

Method: The proposed SSLC method unifies low-rank approximation to retain model structure and sparse optimization to eliminate non-essential weights. It is solved via an iterative optimization process without additional training.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that SSLC consistently outperforms standalone methods, compressing Qwen2.5 by 50% without performance degradation and achieving up to 1.63× speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC is an effective and practical solution for compressing and deploying large language models efficiently, showing promise in addressing their hardware limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

*Rasoul Amirzadeh,Dhananjay Thiruvady,Fatemeh Shiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a probabilistic Bayesian network framework (BNLF) that improves sentiment analysis by integrating predictions from multiple language models, showing a 6% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of large language models (LLMs) such as lack of explainability, high fine-tuning costs, inconsistent domain performance, and environmental concerns by proposing a new framework.

Method: The researchers develop the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which combines predictions from three LLMs (FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet) for sentiment analysis using a probabilistic approach.

Result: BNLF demonstrated approximately 6% increase in accuracy over baseline LLMs when tested on three distinct financial corpora, proving its robustness and consistency.

Conclusion: The BNLF framework successfully integrates LLM predictions probabilistically, enhancing interpretability, increasing accuracy, and offering a potential advancement for domain-specific sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

*Adam E. Flanders,Yifan Peng,Luciano Prevedello,Robyn Ball,Errol Colak,Prahlad Menon,George Shih,Hui-Ming Lin,Paras Lakhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that ensemble learning using multiple large language models (LLMs) can provide a more reliable and consistent evaluation of a pixel-based AI triage tool compared to a single LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to validate whether combining multiple LLM agents can yield superior and more consistent evaluations of an intracranial hemorrhage AI triage tool than using a single LLM model.

Method: A total of 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams were processed using an AI detection tool for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Radiology reports were evaluated by eight open-source LLM models along with a HIPAA-compliant version of GPT-4o. Performance metrics across individual models and ensemble combinations were compared.

Result: The highest AUC and average precision were achieved by the combination of llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o, with values of 0.78 and ~0.76, respectively. Llama3.3:70b also performed best on F1 score, recall, precision, specificity, and MCC. Ensemble models (Full-9, Top-3, Consensus) achieved better consistency than GPT-4o alone, with all ensemble approaches performing comparably.

Conclusion: Ensemble configurations of medium to large open-source LLMs improve consistency and reliability in evaluating clinical AI tools compared to isolated LLMs. These findings support the use of LLM ensembles to derive ground truth evaluations for medical AI applications.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The CORE-KG framework improves automated knowledge graph construction in legal case documents by addressing coreference resolution and guided structured prompts, reducing noise and duplication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle challenges in analyzing human smuggling networks using legal case documents, which often contain unstructured, ambiguous data and result in noisy knowledge graphs.

Method: CORE-KG incorporates a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, which are systematically evaluated through an ablation study to understand their contributions.

Result: Coreference resolution reduced node duplication by 28.32% and legal noise by 4.32%, while structured prompts reduced node duplication by 4.34% and noise by 73.33%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating coreference resolution and structured prompts into knowledge graph construction significantly enhances accuracy and reduces noise, providing empirical guidelines for creating robust LLM-based pipelines.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

### [94] [Hebrew Diacritics Restoration using Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26521)
*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVRIT is a novel Hebrew diacritization system using a Visual Language Model that treats text as an image for zero-shot classification, achieving high accuracy without explicit linguistic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of restoring diacritics in Hebrew text for accurate pronunciation and meaning disambiguation, especially considering the language's high ambiguity when unvocalized.

Method: DIVRIT reframes Hebrew diacritization as a zero-shot classification task, using a Hebrew Visual Language Model that processes text as an image. It predicts the appropriate diacritization pattern for words based on surrounding context and dynamically generated candidate sets.

Result: DIVRIT demonstrates effective diacritization, achieving high accuracy in a controlled 'oracle' setup, and improved generalization through architectural and training optimizations.

Conclusion: Visual representations can significantly enhance Hebrew diacritization accuracy, presenting a promising direction for automated language processing systems.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

### [95] [The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543)
*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores linear operators in transformer language models, showing they focus on recurring semantic properties rather than specific relations, and can be efficiently compressed using tensor networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and behavior of linear relational decoders in transformer language models.

Method: Extended single-relation findings to collections of relations and used a tensor network approach for compression. A cross-evaluation protocol was also developed.

Result: The study found that linear operators extract general semantic properties instead of distinct relations, making them highly compressible without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Linear relational decoding in transformer language models primarily relies on property-centric organization, explaining their compressibility and limited generalization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of low reward density in deep search scenarios by introducing InfoFlow, a framework to optimize rewards obtained per unit of exploration cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of low reward density in deep search scenarios, where exploratory efforts often result in minimal or infrequent rewards.

Method: Introduced InfoFlow, comprising three key approaches: subproblem decomposition for providing intermediate rewards, failure-guided hints to assist stalled agents, and a dual-agent refinement strategy to optimize cognitive processing.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed that InfoFlow significantly outperformed baselines in agentic search benchmarks, allowing lightweight language models to match the performance of advanced proprietary models.

Conclusion: InfoFlow effectively optimizes reward density in deep search scenarios, proving its potential to enhance agentic reinforcement learning processes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

*Yinrong Hong,Zhiquan Tan,Kai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST, a speculative decoding approach for LLMs that optimizes performance by considering GPU configurations and batch sizes, achieving speed-ups and outperforming prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inference latency challenges of large language models by improving speculative decoding methods considering system variables like GPU devices and batch sizes.

Method: Developed a dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST, which refines the tree structure based on inference costs such as GPU configurations and batch sizes.

Result: CAST speeds up decoding by up to 5.2x compared to standard methods and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 5% to 20% across six tasks and six LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST effectively improves speculative decoding for LLMs by optimizing system-dependent variables, achieving faster inference and better accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlideAgent, a framework designed to improve understanding and reasoning within multi-modal, multi-page visual documents, like slide decks, enhancing parsing and querying by decomposing reasoning into hierarchical global, page, and element levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of current LLM systems in analyzing complex visual documents with fine-grained reasoning across multiple pages and elements, as current systems struggle with maintaining coherence and extracting meaningful insights.

Method: SlideAgent employs specialized agents that structure reasoning into three hierarchical levels (global, page, element) to create a query-agnostic representation of the document. During inference, specific agents are activated dynamically for multi-level reasoning, and their outputs are integrated into comprehensive answers.

Result: The proposed SlideAgent model outperforms existing proprietary models by 7.9% and open-source models by 9.8%, demonstrating significant improvements in understanding and handling multi-page visual documents.

Conclusion: SlideAgent provides a robust agentic framework that advances document understanding in multi-modal contexts, showing potential to enhance real-world applications involving complex visual documents.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits encoder-decoder large language models (RedLLM) to address the lack of a rigorous comparative analysis with decoder-only models (DecLLM), demonstrating competitive scaling properties and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to reconsider encoder-decoder models, questioning whether their potential has been underestimated amid the dominance of decoder-only Language Models.

Method: The researchers enhanced encoder-decoder models (RedLLM) by adopting methods from decoder-only models, performing comparative analysis of both at several scales during pretraining and instruction tuning.

Result: RedLLM exhibits strong scaling properties, comparable context length extrapolation, and better inference efficiency, achieving similar or superior performance to DecLLM on specific downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RedLLM represents a viable alternative to DecLLM, offering efficiency and performance advantages with promising potential for future large language model development.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree enhances LLMs' domain adaptation using ontology rules without relying on large datasets, achieving better performance in medical QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting LLMs for specialized fields like healthcare, where high-quality domain-specific data is scarce.

Method: Proposes Evontree framework to extract, validate, and refine domain knowledge within LLMs using ontology rules and self-distilled fine-tuning.

Result: Evontree improved accuracy by up to 3.7% on medical QA benchmarks, outperforming unmodified models and supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Evontree demonstrates effective, efficient, and robust domain adaptation of LLMs, especially in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention mechanism that exceeds full attention in various scenarios, optimizing hardware efficiency and performance for long-term tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance attention mechanisms' performance and efficiency in scenarios requiring short and long contexts, as well as in reinforcement learning scaling regimes.

Method: The research introduces Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), coupled with a chunkwise algorithm using optimized transition matrices, and pretrains a Kimi Linear model with hybrid layers for improved performance.

Result: Kimi Linear exhibits superiority over full attention architectures across evaluated tasks, reduces KV cache usage by up to 75%, and boosts decoding throughput by up to 6x for long-context tasks.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear validates its potential to replace full attention architectures, proving superior in performance, efficiency, and scalability for a wide range of tasks. Resources are also provided for further research optimizations.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

### [102] [The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697)
*Zhichao Wang,Dongyang Ma,Xinting Huang,Deng Cai,Tian Lan,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Xiaoying Tang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco introduces a new architecture to achieve end-to-end generation in LLMs by enabling dynamic self-regulation of decoding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current approach to decoding in LLMs relies on non-differentiable processes and manual tuning of hyperparameters such as temperature and top-p. This paper aims to remove these inefficiencies by enabling the model to learn its own optimal decoding strategy autonomously.

Method: AutoDeco modifies the standard transformer architecture by adding lightweight heads that predict temperature and top-p values dynamically and contextually alongside next-token logits, enabling parametric and token-level self-regulation during decoding.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and matches the performance of oracle-tuned baselines derived from optimizing test-set-specific methods.

Conclusion: AutoDeco provides an innovative approach allowing truly end-to-end generation in LLMs without manual hyperparameter tuning. It showcases emergent abilities for instruction-driven decoding control, highlighting a transformative step for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

### [103] [Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707)
*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how and when value alignment arises during LLM post-training, revealing that supervised fine-tuning predominantly establishes values, while preference optimization has marginal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models (LLMs) align with human values and the training dynamics involved in this process, as this is critical for their societal role.

Method: Analyzed the training dynamics of Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models with different sizes. Used supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization techniques, along with a synthetic dataset for controlled value experimentation.

Result: Key findings include that SFT establishes fundamental values, while preference optimization rarely changes alignment. Different optimization algorithms yield different value outcomes, even with consistent data.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the value alignment dynamics during LLM post-training, offering guidance on data curation and algorithm selection to enhance alignment with human values.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a new benchmark with 50 challenging math problems aimed at testing the mathematical reasoning of LLMs, showing significant room for improvement in their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math benchmarks are becoming ineffective for top-tier LLM evaluation due to performance saturation, necessitating a more challenging standard.

Method: AMO-Bench evaluates LLMs through 50 original, expert-validated Olympiad-level problems, focusing on answer accuracy without requiring proofs for automatic grading.

Result: Experimental results show that the best-performing LLM achieves 52.4% accuracy, while most score below 40%, indicating current limitations in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench highlights the need for further advancements in LLM mathematical reasoning and provides a rigorous tool for future research.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Gistify, a benchmark for coding LLMs requiring creation of minimal reproducing files for specific codebase functionalities, with current models struggling to perform reliably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate coding LLMs on their capability to understand and replicate functionality within large codebases effectively.

Method: Introduces Gistify task requiring coding LLMs to create minimal, self-contained files reproducing outputs of specific functionality in complex codebases.

Result: State-of-the-art coding models fail to consistently solve Gistify tasks, especially when execution traces are long.

Conclusion: Current coding LLMs need improvement in structural understanding, execution modeling, and generating large code patches to succeed in challenging tasks like Gistify.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for underwater object detection using YOLOv5 variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater object detection in dynamic environments by leveraging spatio-temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms.

Method: Performance comparison between standard YOLOv5, T-YOLOv5, and T-YOLOv5 with added CBAM to analyze detection accuracy.

Result: YOLOv5 achieved mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM achieved superior mAP scores of 0.813 and 0.811 respectively.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling improves detection accuracy, and adding CBAM boosts performance further, particularly in challenging conditions, despite a slight trade-off in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIRO, a method that integrates multiple reward models into the training of text-to-image generative models, enhancing visual quality, efficiency, and user preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misalignment between text-to-image models trained on uncurated datasets and user preferences, especially where post-hoc selection harms diversity, semantic fidelity, and efficiency.

Method: MIRO conditions the training of text-to-image models using multiple reward models, allowing direct learning of user preferences rather than post-hoc image selection.

Result: MIRO demonstrates an improvement in visual quality, faster training, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmarks for compositional ability and user preference.

Conclusion: Conditioning on multiple reward models during training can provide better alignment to user preferences, improve generated image quality, and optimize the training process.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: "Brain-IT" proposes a method that reconstructs images viewed by individuals from fMRI data using a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) for accurate and efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the faithfulness of reconstructed images from fMRI data, addressing limitations of current methods that often fail to precisely match the seen images.

Method: The study develops the Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) to handle functional brain-voxel clusters shared across subjects, guiding image reconstruction via localized patch-level semantic and structural features.

Result: BIT achieves superior image reconstructions from fMRI data, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods in fidelity, objective metrics, and efficiency.

Conclusion: Brain-IT provides a significant advancement by enabling high-fidelity image reconstruction with minimal training data, expanding the potential for brain imaging applications such as non-invasive interpretation of neural activity.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Motivation: Address cyclist vulnerability and adapt automotive perception technologies to ensure bicycle safety amidst increasing e-bikes popularity.

Method: Development of 'SenseBike', a multi-sensor platform for 3D LiDAR segmentation, and introduction of BikeScenes-lidarseg dataset for fine-tuning models to improve segmentation accuracy.

Result: Fine-tuning using BikeScenes enhanced model performance significantly, achieving a mIoU of 63.6%, compared to 13.8% using pre-existing training datasets.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training and resources like BikeScenes are crucial to enhance cyclist safety via perception technologies.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning-based method to repair and enhance scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, addressing challenges like tip degradation and slow data acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in STM experiments caused by tip degradation, slow data acquisition, and labor-intensive tip-conditioning procedures.

Method: A physics-informed synthetic data pipeline was used to train machine learning models, including flow-matching and diffusion models, for enhancing and repairing STM images.

Result: The trained models demonstrated effective image restoration and super-resolution capabilities, reducing image acquisition time by two- to fourfold for sparsely sampled data.

Conclusion: The framework can improve STM experimental efficiency, reduce tip-conditioning frequency, and enhance imaging speed, boosting throughput of STM systems overall.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an inversion-free flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework for enhanced image editing by addressing issues of inaccurate inversion processes and gradient entanglement in flow-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of rectified flow models in image editing, such as inaccurate inversion mapping and gradient entanglement during editing.

Method: A novel framework is proposed, where target prompts are semantically decomposed into sub-prompts, independent flows are computed, and aggregated using a projection and soft-aggregation mechanism inspired by multi-task learning.

Result: The method improves semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement in image editing, outperforming existing zero-shot editing approaches.

Conclusion: This framework effectively addresses critical challenges in flow-based image editing, balancing diversity and consistency in outputs via adaptive guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses tumor tracking in real-time MRI under data scarcity using unsupervised registration and SAM-based segmentation. SAM-based methods were chosen for higher performance, achieving a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th in TrackRAD2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges of real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, particularly under conditions of strong data scarcity constraints.

Method: Two approaches were explored: unsupervised image registration with IMPACT similarity metric, and foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 with fine-tuning on limited labeled data. SAM2.1b+ with prompt-based interaction and specific configurations was selected.

Result: After 300 epochs of fine-tuning and a consistent inference strategy, the model performed with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.8794 on the hidden test set, placing 6th in the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of foundation models like SAM for accurate, real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, despite limited labeled data constraints.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism to improve Mamba-based low-light image enhancement by refining spatial and feature exploration while achieving better results with reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in feature exploration and spatial locality in existing Mamba framework-based low-light image enhancement techniques.

Method: The authors propose a novel enhancement - a Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism, which increases the Hausdorff dimension in the scanning pattern, enabling better exploration of the feature space and capturing fine-scale details.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves quantitative and qualitative results in low-light image enhancement while reducing computational requirements and inference time.

Conclusion: The refined framework advances low-light image enhancement performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and broader applicability to other Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAVE, a benchmark dataset for real-world visual anomalies focusing on description, explanation, and justification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limited scope of anomaly detection in computer vision, which has primarily focused on industrial defects or synthetic anomalies, neglecting real-world complexity.

Method: They provide a comprehensive benchmark dataset with fine-grained annotations inspired by cognitive science to assess anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Result: State-of-the-art Vision-Language Models struggle with anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies.

Conclusion: CAVE establishes a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark, offering significant potential for advancing anomaly detection and reasoning research in computer vision.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

*Bilal Hassan,Areg Karapetyan,Aaron Chung Hin Chow,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CNN model for predicting coastal flooding under various scenarios, achieving 20% better accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate flood prediction systems due to challenges brought by climate change and sea-level rise.

Method: Developed a lightweight CNN-based model using a vision-based, low-resource framework, tested on datasets from Abu Dhabi and San Francisco to ensure generalizability.

Result: The model outperformed state-of-the-art methods, significantly reducing the error in flood depth predictions by approximately 20%.

Conclusion: The CNN model is a scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management and adaptation to climate change impacts.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel Video-LLM architecture with stacked temporal attention modules in the vision encoder to improve temporal reasoning and performance on video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle to understand complex temporal dynamics and action sequences in videos, limiting their effectiveness in tasks such as video question answering.

Method: The study proposes a new Video-LLM architecture by integrating stacked temporal attention modules directly in the vision encoder, allowing better capture of action progression and frame relationships.

Result: The model outperforms existing Video-LLMs by achieving up to +5.5% improvement on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME.

Conclusion: The inclusion of temporal attention in the vision encoder significantly enhances the capacity for temporal reasoning in Video-LLMs, addressing a key challenge in video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL is a framework for improved and scalable segmentation of bony structures in ultrasound images, achieving high performance with minimal labeled data, surpassing existing models by 1-27% Dice coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated segmentation for ultrasound imaging in children can enhance diagnostics and therapy for common fractures, while addressing the high cost and time requirements of expert annotations.

Method: The proposed framework, FlexICL, applies a flexible in-context learning approach for segmenting bony regions in ultrasound images. By utilizing minimal expert annotations and employing innovative image concatenation and augmentation techniques, the method achieves high accuracy in object segmentation across diverse datasets.

Result: FlexICL achieved robust performance across wrist and elbow ultrasound datasets, requiring only 5% of training images while outperforming well-known models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, U-Net, and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice coefficient.

Conclusion: FlexICL offers a practical, accurate, and scalable solution for ultrasound image segmentation, especially useful in scenarios with limited annotated data, demonstrating potential for widespread medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic Negative Prompting approach leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adaptive negative prompts during the denoising process in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Negative Prompting aims to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of image generation in diffusion models by addressing the limitations of fixed negative prompts.

Method: Intermediate image predictions are generated during specific denoising steps, and VLMs are queried to dynamically produce negative prompts suitable for the context.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets reveal trade-offs between the strength of negative guidance and alignment between text and images.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates improved adaptability and contextual relevance over traditional static negative prompting approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [119] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerabilities of multi-modal diffusion models, introducing a novel attack called PReMA to manipulate outputs by modifying input images without altering prompts, primarily to expose risks such as NSFW content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the overlooked susceptibility of multi-modal diffusion models, specifically concerning the misalignment between textual and image modalities, which can lead to generation of inappropriate content.

Method: The authors introduce a new attack method, Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA), which manipulates the generated outputs of models by altering adversarial image inputs (while retaining prompts).

Result: PReMA effectively exploits vulnerabilities within multi-modal diffusion models, demonstrating its impact through image-editing tasks like inpainting and style transfer across various models.

Conclusion: PReMA highlights critical weaknesses in existing multi-modal diffusion models and poses serious implications, encouraging further exploration of security in these technologies.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoExo-Con, a benchmark to address Video-LLMs' consistency in temporal understanding with synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs. It proposes View-GRPO to improve cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve temporal understanding consistency in Video-LLMs when analyzing synchronized video pairs of the same event captured from different viewpoints.

Method: Developed the EgoExo-Con benchmark for evaluating temporal understanding and consistency; proposed View-GRPO, a reinforcement learning approach for enhancing cross-view temporal reasoning and consistency.

Result: Analysis highlights existing Video-LLMs' consistency issues and showcases the effectiveness of the proposed View-GRPO in improving cross-view temporal understanding.

Conclusion: EgoExo-Con and View-GRPO advance the study of temporal reasoning consistency in Video-LLMs, with publicly available resources to encourage further research.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is an advanced system aimed at improving Oracle Bone Script (OBS) research efficiency through structured information management, leveraging a comprehensive knowledge base and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OBS research involves complex workflows and inefficient information retrieval, posing significant challenges for experts in the field.

Method: OracleAgent integrates multiple analysis tools with large language models and employs a domain-specific, multimodal knowledge base constructed with expert annotations.

Result: Experiments show OracleAgent surpasses leading multimodal large language models in reasoning and generation tasks, while reducing time costs for experts in OBS research.

Conclusion: OracleAgent represents a substantial advancement in automated systems for OBS research, enhancing efficiency and enabling practical deployment for scholarly use.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel view synthesis technique that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without reliance on external tools like COLMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods depend on external pose estimation tools, causing computational issues and error propagation.

Method: A unified framework with iterative joint optimization of 3D Gaussian points and camera poses, divided into interleaved phases using differentiable rendering and a custom 3D optical flow algorithm.

Result: It reduces errors in scenarios with large viewpoint changes and sparse features, excelling in reconstruction quality compared to existing methods including COLMAP.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scene reconstruction fidelity and pose accuracy, outperforming COLMAP-free techniques and traditional COLMAP-based approaches.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E), which focuses on challenging long-tail driving scenarios and presents a novel evaluation metric called Rater Feedback Score (RFS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks and metrics for vision-based end-to-end driving inadequately address multi-modal and challenging long-tail scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the WOD-E2E dataset, containing curated driving segments for rare real-world situations, and introduce Rater Feedback Score (RFS) for open-loop evaluation based on rater-annotated trajectory preference labels.

Result: The dataset includes 4,021 driving segments ensuring coverage of rare long-tail scenarios, alongside validation labels for evaluating the RFS metric.

Conclusion: This work aims to advance research in creating robust, generalizable, and safe autonomous driving systems for complex real-world conditions.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating gradient-based attention directly into CNN representations, enhancing performance in RGB-D indoor SLAM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual tasks like SLAM by utilizing gradient-based network attention to enrich spatially attentive object locations.

Method: The authors proposed integrating layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients into CNN feature representations for enhanced frame association in RGB-D indoor SLAM.

Result: Experimental results showed the proposed method improved performance compared to baseline methods, especially in large environments.

Conclusion: The integration of attention information into CNN representations proves beneficial for semantic understanding in SLAM, indicating increased application potential for this approach.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FullPart, a framework combining implicit and explicit paradigms for detailed 3D part-based generation, and introduces a new dataset, PartVerse-XL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the geometric detail and quality of 3D part-based generation, addressing limitations in current implicit and explicit representations.

Method: Combines implicit box vector-set diffusion for bounding box layouts and explicit full-resolution voxel grids for detailed part generation, along with a center-point encoding strategy for coherence.

Result: FullPart demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation. The authors also developed a large human-annotated dataset (PartVerse-XL) for reliable part data.

Conclusion: The dual-paradigm approach enables intricate 3D part designs and global coherence, with provided resources encouraging further advancements in 3D part-based generation research.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BasicAVSR, a video super-resolution framework achieving superior quality and speed for arbitrary-scale applications through novel components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution demands solving challenges in spatial detail, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.

Method: BasicAVSR integrates four key components: adaptive multi-scale frequency priors, flow-guided spatiotemporal propagation, second-order motion compensation, and hyper-upsampling units.

Result: BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in super-resolution quality, generalization, and inference speed across online and offline scenarios.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR establishes a new benchmark for AVSR and its versatile methods can adapt to diverse frameworks and tasks efficiently.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles breast cancer detection using a Multi-View Mammography and Language Model (MV-MLM), leveraging image-text data pairs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on malignancy classification, subtype classification, and cancer risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring large annotated datasets for breast cancer CAD models is costly and time-consuming, and Vision-Language Models could enhance robustness and efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes the MV-MLM leveraging multi-view supervision via cross-modal self-supervision across mammogram image and synthetic radiology report pairs, integrating visual-textual learning for classification tasks.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing methods in malignancy classification, subtype classification, and risk prediction tasks, showing high accuracy and data efficiency using synthetic reports instead of real radiology data.

Conclusion: MV-MLM showcases superior performance and efficiency in medical imaging tasks, highlighting the potential of Vision-Language Models in CAD applications without needing extensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-based system employing YOLOv8 to accurately detect auto-rickshaws in traffic images, achieving promising results with mAP50 of 83.447%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve challenges with monitoring and identifying auto-rickshaws in traffic due to their similarity with other vehicles and limitations of manual video analysis.

Method: The paper utilizes a machine learning approach with the YOLOv8 object detection model, trained on 1,730 annotated traffic images captured under different conditions.

Result: The model performed efficiently, with mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall exceeding 78%, effective in varying traffic densities. The annotated dataset was publicly released for further use.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning model is effective in real-time auto-rickshaw detection, streamlining traffic management in densely populated South Asian cities.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM establishes a benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations using wearable devices, featuring diverse datasets and complex challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With wearable devices becoming more prevalent, a benchmark for multi-modal retrieval augmented generation (MM-RAG) tailored to real-world wearable scenarios is needed.

Method: The benchmark includes 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, designed to simulate egocentric captures. Tasks were created for single-source, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations with paired retrieval corpora.

Result: Straightforward RAG approaches achieve 32% and 43% truthfulness for single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, while state-of-the-art industry solutions show similar results. Winning solutions in KDD Cup 2025 improved baseline performance by 28%.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM provides a robust framework for evaluating MM-RAG methods in wearable scenarios and demonstrates significant room for improvement in these technologies.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

### [130] [MoTDiff: High-resolution Motion Trajectory estimation from a single blurred image using Diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26173)
*Wontae Choi,Jaelin Lee,Hyung Sup Yun,Byeungwoo Jeon,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoTDiff, a framework using diffusion models for high-resolution motion trajectory estimation from a single blurred image, outperforming existing motion representation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for extracting motion information often produce low-quality representations that are imprecise and coarse-grained. This paper aims to improve motion trajectory estimation to aid computational imaging and computer vision applications.

Method: MoTDiff employs a conditional diffusion framework to leverage multi-scale feature maps and introduces a specialized training method to enhance fine-grained motion trajectory detection, shape consistency, and pixel connectivity.

Result: Experiments reveal MoTDiff delivers superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography.

Conclusion: MoTDiff represents a noteworthy improvement in motion trajectory estimation, offering high-resolution, accurate motion paths from blurred images for improved imaging and vision tasks.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

*Jinho Choi,Hyesu Lim,Steffen Schneider,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConceptScope, a framework for identifying and analyzing biases in visual datasets without needing costly annotations, using Sparse Autoencoders and vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is pervasive in machine learning and hard to identify without fine-grained annotations. The paper aims to address this challenge by automating the detection and categorization of biases.

Method: ConceptScope uses Sparse Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models to discover and categorize concepts into target, context, and bias types for dataset analysis and subgrouping.

Result: ConceptScope successfully identifies biases and visual concepts, aligns concept activations with meaningful image regions, and detects both known and unknown biases in datasets such as Waterbirds and ImageNet.

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a scalable and practical framework for analyzing biases in visual datasets, aiding in dataset auditing and improving model diagnostics.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

### [132] [Sketch2PoseNet: Efficient and Generalized Sketch to 3D Human Pose Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26196)
*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for 3D human pose estimation from sketches, overcoming challenges with a synthetic dataset and data-driven framework, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human pose estimation from sketches is challenging due to the abstract nature of sketches and limited annotated datasets, which hinders the development of accurate and efficient methods.

Method: The authors developed a synthetic dataset (SKEP-120K) using a diffusion model that converts 2D poses into sketches. This dataset supports an end-to-end framework combining 2D pose detectors, sketch feature extraction using diffusion priors, and neural networks for 2D pose estimation with geometric coherence.

Result: The proposed model outperformed existing methods in accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks, as demonstrated through qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The integration of synthetic data generation and a data-driven framework successfully addresses the challenges of sketch-based 3D human pose estimation, opening potential applications in computer animation and film production.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel geometric deep network, Ch-EGN, for enhancing supply chain sustainability and performance efficiency, achieving high accuracy in risk management and product classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks in supply chains and improve sustainability and performance efficiency by leveraging advanced deep network architectures.

Method: Development of a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning ensemble network, Ch-EGN, tested on two datasets (SupplyGraph and DataCo) for risk management and product classification.

Result: The proposed method achieved high accuracy: 98.95% in risk management, 100% in 5-product classification, 98.07% in 4-relation classification, and 92.37% in company relation classification.

Conclusion: The ensemble network enhances supply chain sustainability and risk management, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

### [134] [OmniLayout: Enabling Coarse-to-Fine Learning with LLMs for Universal Document Layout Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26213)
*Hengrui Kang,Zhuangcheng Gu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zichen Wen,Bin Wang,Weijia Li,Conghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniLayout-LLM, a novel model for document layout generation, powered by a diverse OmniLayout-1M dataset and a Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most of the advances in Document AI focus on document layout analysis rather than generation. There is a lack of diverse document layouts for generative tasks, especially for non-academic genres like newspapers and magazines.

Method: The researchers curated OmniLayout-1M, a large-scale dataset covering diverse document types. A two-stage Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm was proposed: first by learning layout principles from the dataset, and then refining domain-specific knowledge.

Result: OmniLayout-LLM showed strong performance across multiple domains, outperforming existing layout generation models and general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: This work fills a gap in the document layout generation field, providing a scalable dataset and high-performing model. The code, models, and dataset will be open for public use.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses robustness challenges in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, examining performance under 17 perturbations across four modalities and introducing RobustVLA to mitigate input/output disturbances effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models against real-world multimodal perturbations that impact actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

Method: Evaluate mainstream VLAs against 17 perturbations across four modalities, identify weaknesses, and propose RobustVLA with offline robust optimization, consistent actions enforcement, and a multi-armed bandit approach for perturbation handling.

Result: RobustVLA provides a significant robustness improvement, achieving gains of 12.6% and 10.4% on pi0 and OpenVLA backbones, respectively, and excels on real-world FR5 robots with a 65.6% performance boost under perturbations.

Conclusion: RobustVLA delivers superior robustness and efficiency under diverse and mixed multimodal perturbations compared to existing VLA solutions, making it suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

*Shiho Matta,Lis Kanashiro Pereira,Peitao Han,Fei Cheng,Shigeru Kitazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper assesses the temporal reasoning capability of modern vision-language models (VLMs) using a benchmark called AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, revealing their poor accuracy compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models excel at multimodal tasks but lack robust evaluation and understanding of temporal aspects in video, which are critical to advancing VLMs' reasoning capability.

Method: The paper proposes the AoT-PsyPhyBENCH benchmark based on psychophysically validated video clips for temporal reasoning assessment and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of various VLMs against human baselines.

Result: Most VLMs perform near chance levels in judging temporal direction (AoT), significantly underperforming compared to humans on irreversible physical and causal processes.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack the required inductive biases for understanding temporal continuity and causal structure. The research emphasizes the need for progress in VLMs' physical and temporal reasoning abilities, providing benchmarks for future development.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

*Lin Guo,Xiaoqing Luo,Wei Xie,Zhancheng Zhang,Hui Li,Rui Wang,Zhenhua Feng,Xiaoning Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCLFuse, an improved method for infrared and visible image fusion, emphasizing generative techniques inspired by human cognitive laws to achieve enhanced fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing modal information and lack interpretability in complex fusion scenarios, motivating the development of a more reliable and consistent technique.

Method: HCLFuse employs a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder with posterior probability modeling and information decomposition. It integrates diffusion model capabilities with physical laws for adaptive generation, improving structure perception and reducing quality dependence.

Result: The method exhibits state-of-the-art results in qualitative and quantitative image fusion evaluations, and enhances semantic segmentation metrics across various datasets.

Conclusion: HCLFuse, inspired by human cognitive principles, improves structural consistency and detail quality in image fusion, displaying superior generative performance and practical advantages.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification and finds that score-level fusion of multiple CNNs achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve periocular verification at different distances by investigating the complementarity of CNN architectures.

Method: Three CNN architectures (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) trained on VGGFace2 database; score-level fusion via logistic regression; performance analysis with cosine and chi2 metrics; attention comparison with LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Result: ResNet50 performs best individually, but score-level fusion of all three networks yields the highest performance, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the UBIPr database.

Conclusion: Network complementarity enhances periocular verification; fusing diverse CNNs results in significant performance improvements.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving autonomous driving planning through a novel framework called CATG, which addresses limitations in current methods by integrating constraints and driving style control into trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues in existing imitation learning methods like mode collapse and difficulties in incorporating safety and physical constraints during trajectory generation.

Method: The proposed CATG framework uses Constrained Flow Matching to integrate constraints and guidance signals directly in the trajectory generation process, avoiding post-generation optimization.

Result: CATG achieved 2nd place in the NavSim v2 challenge with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and received the Innovation Award.

Conclusion: CATG offers a promising solution to address mode collapse and constrained trajectory generation for autonomous driving, showcasing competitive performance and innovative advancements.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of deep CNN architectures for periocular recognition using large-scale datasets. Results highlight differences in biometric performance between in-the-wild and controlled image conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve biometric recognition in terms of accuracy and usability by focusing on periocular region analysis using deep CNNs and large-scale datasets.

Method: Three CNN architectures of varying complexity were trained on over 1.9 million ocular images from VGGFace2. Performance was assessed on VGGFace2-Pose and UFPR-Periocular datasets to evaluate recognition effectiveness.

Result: EERs on VGGFace2-Pose ranged from 9-15%, while UFPR-Periocular dataset achieved significantly better EERs of 1-2%, marking the lowest EERs reported for UFPR Periocular data.

Conclusion: The quality and acquisition protocols of image datasets significantly impact biometric recognition performance. Controlled environments yield notably better results for periocular recognition compared to in-the-wild conditions.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scheduling challenges in large-scale, dynamic, and complex environments for AEOS constellations require better methodologies as current models often oversimplify realities.

Method: The authors developed AEOS-Bench, a benchmark suite with realistic simulated scenarios and annotations, and AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based model incorporating constraint-aware attention, designed using iterative learning.

Result: AEOS-Former demonstrated superior performance in task completion and resource efficiency compared to baseline models, validated through experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The AEOS framework addresses gaps in realistic and efficient satellite scheduling, establishing benchmark standards and achieving improved operational outcomes. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

*Junlai Qiu,Yunzhu Chen,Hao Zheng,Yawen Huang,Yuexiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel paradigm integrating CNN and ViT backbones to enhance diabetic retinopathy diagnosis accuracy using evidential fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy significantly affects vision and mental health, necessitating improved diagnostic methods for early detection and impactful clinical screening.

Method: Evidential fusion paradigm combines CNN's local feature extraction with ViT's global feature capturing, leveraging deep evidential networks to tune fusion patterns dynamically.

Result: The hybrid model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DR grading accuracy and enhances interpretability in feature fusion and decision-making.

Conclusion: Integrating CNN and ViT via evidential fusion proves effective for advanced DR grading, leading to better diagnostic efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [144] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR improves scene-text super-resolution by using a diffusion framework that balances text readability and visual quality, achieving better OCR performance without sacrificing perceptual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of improving text readability in scene-text images while maintaining perceptual quality, as previous SR methods often overlook text legibility or treat text as generic texture.

Method: The proposed GLYPH-SR framework employs a vision-language-guided diffusion method with TS-ControlNet guided by OCR data and a ping-pong scheduler alternating between text- and scene-centric guidance, trained on a synthetic corpus.

Result: GLYPH-SR enhances OCR F1 scores by up to +15.18 percentage points on multiple benchmarks (e.g., SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80) at x4 and x8 scales, while performing competitively on perceptual metrics like MANIQA and CLIP-IQA.

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR successfully achieves high scene-text readability and visual realism, making it a practical solution for accurate text super-resolution in real-world applications.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

### [145] [Spiking Patches: Asynchronous, Sparse, and Efficient Tokens for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26614)
*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing Spiking Patches, a new tokenization method for event cameras that preserves spatial sparsity and asynchronous properties while achieving high accuracy and faster inference on gesture recognition and object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in preserving the asynchronous and spatially sparse properties of event data while maintaining high performance and efficiency in event-based vision.

Method: Developing Spiking Patches as a tokenizer for event cameras, utilizing a novel approach compared to synchronous frames and voxel representations to better retain event camera properties.

Result: Spiking Patches enabled up to 3.4x faster inference compared to voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames, with accuracy improvements of up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and 1.4 for object detection.

Conclusion: Tokenization with Spiking Patches offers a promising approach in event-based vision, effectively balancing computational efficiency and accuracy while maintaining event camera-specific properties.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods struggle with low fidelity and semantic coherence due to the lack of spatial attention mechanisms.

Method: The framework combines EEG embeddings through Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) with spatial saliency maps via fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 2.1 on LoRA and a ControlNet branch for spatial control.

Result: Significant improvements were achieved in reconstructing quality low- and high-level image features and greater alignment with human visual attention, validated on THINGS-EEG dataset.

Conclusion: Spatial saliency and attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity image reconstructions with applications in neuroadaptive interfaces and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench is a benchmark designed for evaluating long-form text-to-video generation using complex prompts and multi-dimensional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation methods excel at short clips but struggle with evaluating long-form outputs. Existing evaluations lack metrics for narrative coherence and thematic expression.

Method: The benchmark includes realistic complex prompts focusing on elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. It also introduces multi-dimensional metrics, such as event-level alignment, HERD, and temporal consistency.

Result: Nine text-to-video generation models were evaluated. Methods performed well on visual and temporal aspects but struggled with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench offers a reliable platform for evaluating long-form text-to-video generation and outlines areas of improvement for future methods.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [148] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes A-TPT, an advanced test-time prompt tuning framework for large vision-language models (VLMs), which improves calibration by promoting angular diversity in textual feature distribution, resulting in better performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the calibration performance of VLMs during test-time prompt tuning by addressing the lack of dispersion in textual features, which affects reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: A-TPT introduces angular diversity to maximize the minimum pairwise angular distance between normalized textual features induced by learnable prompts. This ensures uniform feature distribution and improved calibration on unseen tasks.

Result: A-TPT successfully reduces calibration error while maintaining competitive accuracy. It achieves robust zero-shot calibration performance on tasks with natural distribution shifts and generalizes effectively to medical datasets.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity is a potent approach to achieving well-dispersed textual features for effective test-time adaptation in VLMs. A-TPT offers state-of-the-art calibration performance, enhancing reliability and safety in practical applications.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances existing 3D reconstruction models (DUSt3R and MASt3R) for static point tracking and proposes adaptations for dynamic point tracking, showcasing competitive performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize foundational 3D reconstruction models for point tracking in both static and dynamic contexts, thereby improving tracking performance on benchmarks.

Method: The authors adapt DUSt3R and MASt3R through additional dynamic correspondence, a visibility head, and fine-tuned training using synthetic data for point tracking across pairs of frames without temporal context.

Result: Achieved competitive or superior point tracking results on four datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models like CoTracker2 and CoTracker3 in specific tasks.

Conclusion: Point tracking can be enhanced using adapted 3D reconstruction models, and the proposed method yields better accuracy and robustness in static and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

### [150] [Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464)
*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FineGrainedAD, a framework for improving few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) using fine-grained semantic captions and multi-level learnable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods struggle with semantic misalignment between patch-level visual anomalies and image-level textual descriptions, leading to suboptimal localization performance.

Method: The authors propose Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) for detailed textual descriptions and FineGrainedAD framework with Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA) to improve alignment and aggregation of visual regions.

Result: FineGrainedAD achieves superior anomaly detection and localization performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD enhances anomaly detection by addressing the semantic alignment issue with fine-grained captions and strategic alignment methods, demonstrating significant improvement in FSAD tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object-context bias in vision-language models by proposing a counterfactual inference method to improve zero-shot robustness and debiased reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with object-context biases, where predictions rely on familiar co-occurrences. This limits their reliability in zero-shot scenarios with novel scenes.

Method: The authors use counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse contexts and apply causal inference techniques like estimating Total Direct Effect to mitigate biased activations.

Result: Without retraining, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, improving both worst-group and average performance.

Conclusion: The framework enhances zero-shot multimodal reasoning, offering a practical and lightweight way to address biases without model retraining, and sets a new standard for reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses an imbalance issue in self-improvement of large vision-language models (LVLMs), leading to improved visual reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the "Matthew effect" in self-improvement processes of LVLMs, where the models favor simple queries over complex ones, hindering improvement in reasoning skills.

Method: Four efficient strategies are introduced for distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling during self-improvement to ensure balanced optimization of reasoning skills.

Result: These strategies improved visual reasoning performance by an average of 3.86 points, consistently outperforming traditional self-improvement methods.

Conclusion: Head-tail re-balancing strategies mitigate the "Matthew effect" and enhance model training for more complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Motivation: Civil engineering applications have limited annotated data, necessitating efficient object detection systems that perform well with smaller datasets.

Method: The authors integrated DINOv3 features into YOLOv12 at preprocessing (P0) and backbone enhancement (P3). They conducted systematic ablation tests across different architecture scales and feature integration strategies.

Result: DINO-YOLO significantly improved detection performance: Tunnel Segment Crack detection (+12.4%), Construction PPE detection (+13.7%), and KITTI dataset detection (+88.6%), while maintaining 30-47 FPS for real-time inference.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art detection performance for civil engineering datasets (<10K images) and ensures computational efficiency suitable for field deployment.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new adaptable edge detection method using optimized two-dimensional cellular automaton and transfer learning techniques, emphasizing its robustness but noting the limited effectiveness of expanded search space and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses challenges in edge detection, particularly difficulties in detecting loose edges and lack of context for specific images, by proposing a more adaptable detection method.

Method: A two-dimensional cellular automaton optimized by meta-heuristic techniques combined with transfer learning was utilized for edge detection.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated adaptability across different image sets, but expanding the optimization search space and applying transfer learning did not yield significant improvements.

Conclusion: The method is adaptable to diverse inputs, but certain enhancements, such as expanded optimization and transfer learning, were not impactful.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in spine segmentation for scoliosis diagnosis, focusing on spatial correlation and rich structural information of spine bones.

Method: The paper proposes SA$^{2}$Net, featuring scale-adaptive complementary strategies, structure-affinity transformation combined with a Transformer decoder, and feature mixing loss aggregation.

Result: SA$^{2}$Net demonstrates superior segmentation performance over state-of-the-art methods, showing enhanced robustness and adaptability to various backbones.

Conclusion: SA$^{2}$Net proves to be a promising tool for intelligent spinal image analysis, potentially advancing scoliosis diagnosis. The code is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Motivation: The traditional manual process for creating shorter ad versions is labor-intensive and inefficient, necessitating an automated solution tailored for advertising.

Method: A two-stream audio-visual fusion model is developed to predict the importance of video frames, using a novel ad-specific dataset called AdSum204.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art video summarization methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: This framework successfully addresses the unique challenges in ad clipping, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

*Manjunath Prasad Holenarasipura Rajiv,B. M. Vidyavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in AI systems by introducing a framework to enhance scene understanding in unfamiliar environments using Vision-Language Alignment, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle in dynamic real-world scenarios without labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of conventional models.

Method: This approach integrates pre-trained vision transformers and language models, combining global scene cues and object-level linguistic prior interactions for reasoning.

Result: The framework showed up to 18% improved accuracy over baseline models in zero-shot benchmarks and demonstrated robustness in ambiguous environments.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, interpretable solution for advancing generalized and context-aware reasoning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CATCH, a modular framework to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) across diverse domains without requiring backbone model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing VQA models in handling out-of-domain scenarios like remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, and to create a scalable, cost-efficient domain adaptation mechanism.

Method: The authors propose a decoupled adaptation framework using two lightweight modules: a domain classifier for input image type identification and a dual adapter mechanism (Prompt Adapter and Visual Adapter) for language and vision feature modulation. Both modules are integrated dynamically via a unified hook interface.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements across domain-specific VQA benchmarks such as MathVQA (+2.3 BLEU), MedVQA-RAD (+2.6 VQA), and ChartQA (+3.1 ROUGE), all achieved without retraining the backbone model.

Conclusion: CATCH successfully enhances the generalization of VQA models across multiple domains, providing a flexible and scalable solution for diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to develop a multimodal world model that integrates vision and language prediction for advanced reasoning and generation tasks.

Method: The method includes pre-training on a large corpus of interleaved vision-language data with next-token prediction and post-training using reinforcement learning. Additionally, Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA) accelerates inference.

Result: Emu3.5 performs well in multimodal tasks like vision-language generation and world exploration and surpasses Gemini 2.5 in interleaved generation tasks.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 demonstrates superior performance in multimodal tasks, efficient generation, and is open-sourced for further community development.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ResMatching, a novel computational super-resolution (CSR) method for fluorescence microscopy, which employs guided conditional flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the ill-posed inverse problem of computational super-resolution by leveraging improved data-driven priors enabled through advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: ResMatching uses guided conditional flow matching to improve priors in computational super-resolution. Performance evaluations are conducted on 4 biological structures from the BioSR dataset against 7 baseline methods.

Result: ResMatching consistently provides a balance of data fidelity and perceptual realism, particularly excelling in scenarios with noisy low-resolution images. It also computes calibrated pixel-wise data uncertainties, aiding in rejecting uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: ResMatching is an effective CSR approach with strong priors that enhance resolution quality, offering robust predictions and calibrated uncertainty measurements for fluorescence microscopy applications.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance over existing methods when evaluated on data from Canadian Prairies.

Conclusion: CYPRESS bridges Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, providing a scalable tool for precision agriculture and detailed monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Result: The survey highlights the integration potential of modern AI paradigms like LLMs and VLMs with AV perception frameworks, and uncovers gaps and opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for advancing object detection in AVs by emphasizing emerging AI techniques and fostering cohesive development across related technologies.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 48 deep learning optical flow models on SAR sea ice imagery, achieving small endpoint errors in estimating sea ice drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sea ice drift estimation is crucial for Arctic navigation, climate research, and forecasting, but existing methods are limited in complex scenarios.

Method: Large-scale benchmarking of deep learning optical flow models using RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR imagery and metric evaluation against GNSS buoy data.

Result: Several models achieve high accuracy, capturing regional drift patterns with sub-kilometer errors.

Conclusion: Deep learning optical flow methods are effective in polar remote sensing, providing spatially continuous drift fields for advanced applications in navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

TL;DR: This paper introduces techniques to improve object detection under occlusions using scene context to enhance Region Proposal Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions pose challenges to accurate object recognition. Using scene context can potentially improve algorithms by reducing errors caused by these occlusions.

Method: The paper presents two techniques for scene-based information fusion: one selecting object networks based on the identified background scene prior to prediction, and another enhancing object scores using scene knowledge post-detection. Different training methodologies for handling occlusions are also evaluated.

Result: The proposed methods show improvements in recall and precision on challenging datasets with occlusions. Combining training on both occluded and unoccluded images yields better performance.

Conclusion: The methods are interpretable and adaptable to other datasets, opening possibilities for further research and practical applications in object detection with occlusions.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Motivation: To address the lack of fine-grained control over VLM outputs and mitigate issues like hallucination while preserving performance on tasks.

Method: The approach uses a steering module that dynamically adjusts latent embeddings and activations, utilizing dimension-wise modulation and adaptive steering across layers, requiring minimal additional parameters.

Result: SteerVLM demonstrates superior performance in steering and reducing hallucinations compared to existing techniques, supported by the introduction of the VNIA dataset.

Conclusion: This study proposes an effective solution for controlling VLMs using activation engineering, without modifying model weights or requiring manual tuning.

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through

Conclusion: The research demonstrates significant advancements in AMD lesion detection, providing a highly effective and openly accessible framework for use in non-invasive imaging techniques.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our

evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with extracting detailed and fine-grained structures from charts, hindering their usability in complex chart comparison and reasoning tasks.

Method: ChartAB provides a JSON template for detailed evaluation of grounding tasks and incorporates a two-stage inference workflow for cross-chart reasoning.

Result: Analyzing recent VLMs with ChartAB exposes biases, weaknesses, robustness issues, and hallucinations in their chart understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The research identifies key areas of improvement for VLMs in chart understanding and highlights the need for enhanced capabilities for handling fine-grained chart discrepancies.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Motivation: There is a need for a generalizable approach to model hierarchical motion dynamics across various fields due to the limitations of fixed, heuristic-based hierarchies.

Method: The approach represents motion using graph-based hierarchies, decomposing global motion into inherited patterns and local residuals, and employs graph neural networks for differentiable graph learning of parent-child relationships.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs hierarchy in 1D and 2D motion cases and shows improved interpretability and realism in 3D dynamic scene deformation compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: This method introduces a versatile, data-driven paradigm for hierarchical motion modeling, enabling applications across diverse motion-centric domains.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

### [172] [The Quest for Generalizable Motion Generation: Data, Model, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26794)
*Jing Lin,Ruisi Wang,Junzhe Lu,Ziqi Huang,Guorui Song,Ailing Zeng,Xian Liu,Chen Wei,Wanqi Yin,Qingping Sun,Zhongang Cai,Lei Yang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comprehensive framework that transfers video generation insights to 3D human motion generation, featuring a large dataset (ViMoGen-228K), a flow-matching diffusion model (ViMoGen/ViMoGen-light), and an evaluation benchmark (MBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human motion generation models lack strong generalization capabilities. Notable improvements in video generative models highlight transferable insights that could improve motion generation.

Method: The framework leverages three pillars: creating a large-scale dataset (ViMoGen-228K), developing a diffusion transformer model (ViMoGen and its distilled variant ViMoGen-light), and introducing a hierarchical benchmark (MBench) for evaluations.

Result: The framework shows significantly better performance than existing approaches in motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability, verified through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating insights from video generation into 3D motion generation enhances performance and generalization. The public release of code, data, and benchmarks will aid future research in the field.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of fine-grained geo-localization of images at a global scale, combining proxy classification and aerial imagery embeddings to achieve high precision across large geographic areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of standard image retrieval at a global scale and overcome limitations like domain gaps and coarse classification in geo-localization.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid method that uses proxy classification task during training for rich feature representations and combines ground and aerial imagery embeddings for robust fine-grained geo-localization across continents.

Result: The proposed approach enables precise geo-localization within 200m accuracy for over 68% of queries in a dataset spanning a large region in Europe.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully addresses the challenge of scalable and fine-grained geo-localization and achieves significant precision at a continental scale. The code is publicly available for future validation and improvement.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEE4D, a novel framework for pose-free spatiotemporal content generation from casual videos. It separates camera control from scene dynamics and eliminates the need for 3D annotations by using virtual cameras and a robust video inpainting model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to synthesize 4D spatiotemporal content from casual videos while avoiding costly and labor-intensive 3D supervision, such as manually annotated camera poses, and addressing limitations in existing methods.

Method: The proposed SEE4D method replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering content to a bank of fixed virtual cameras. It employs a view-conditional video inpainting model for geometry prior learning and incorporates a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline for coherent video generation.

Result: SEE4D outperforms pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior generalization and improved performance in cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: SEE4D offers a practical advancement in 4D modeling by enabling efficient world modeling from casual videos without dependence on explicit 3D annotations. The virtual camera setup enhances flexibility and generalization.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach, Masked Diffusion Captioning (MDC), to learn visual features by reconstructing masked text in image-caption pairs, improving vision tasks without needing auxiliary objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the learning of visual features from image-caption pairs without relying heavily on token positions or auxiliary objectives.

Method: Masked Diffusion Captioning (MDC) trains a decoder, conditioned on visual features, to reconstruct masked text in image-caption pairs using a masked diffusion language model.

Result: Visual features learned via MDC are competitive with features from autoregressive and contrastive approaches based on linear probing experiments on various models and datasets.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion captioning provides an effective way to train visual features for downstream vision tasks, reducing reliance on positional token significance and auxiliary objectives.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniX, a framework to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes using a 2D lifting technique repurposed for panoramic perception, texture, and materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D scene generation to be suitable for physically based rendering, relighting, and simulation using 2D lifting techniques and generative models.

Method: The authors developed OmniX, a unified framework based on a lightweight cross-modal adapter. It uses 2D generative priors for panoramic vision tasks and utilizes a synthetic panorama dataset containing multimodal panoramas.

Result: OmniX showed effectiveness in panoramic visual perception and generating graphics-ready 3D scenes in diverse virtual environments.

Conclusion: OmniX advances the capability of panorama-based 2D lifting techniques to create immersive, realistic, and physically realistic 3D scenes, further supporting tasks like relighting and simulation.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the reasoning capabilities of the Veo-3 video generation model across multiple dimensions, highlighting both promising aspects and significant limitations in its zero-shot reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether current video generation models, particularly Veo-3, can serve as effective zero-shot reasoners in complex visual reasoning tasks.

Method: The researchers systematically assess Veo-3's reasoning abilities across 12 dimensions using the MME-CoF benchmark, which focuses on Chain-of-Frame reasoning.

Result: Results show that Veo-3 performs well in short-term spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and local dynamics, but struggles with long-term causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Current video models like Veo-3 are promising as complementary visual tools but are not yet robust enough to act as standalone zero-shot reasoners.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Zixu Shen,Kexin Chu,Yifan Zhang,Dawei Xiang,Runxin Wu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ExpertFlow optimizes MoE inference by adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing, significantly reducing memory-related latencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern GPUs have constrained memory capacity, limiting the scalability of large language models. Mixture-of-Experts architectures address these limitations, but they often suffer from latency issues due to inefficient parameter transfer and outdated cross-layer prediction strategies.

Method: ExpertFlow leverages runtime statistics for adaptive expert prefetching and introduces a hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme to anticipate future expert needs. It dynamically refines prefetching decisions based on model feedback and actual usage.

Result: ExpertFlow reduces model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, effectively decreasing latency caused by expert swap-ins and improving MoE inference under memory constraints.

Conclusion: ExpertFlow enhances the scalability and efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts architectures, addressing both memory limitations and latency issues to optimize inference performance.

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

Motivation: To provide a comprehensive understanding of KANs' potential as a superior alternative to traditional MLPs and to establish their theoretical and practical advantages.

Method: Systematic review and synthesis of KAN theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical implementations, analyzing basis functions and categorizing advancements.

Result: The review highlights KANs' parameter efficiency, their ability to leverage diverse basis functions, and detailed advancements in architecture, implementation, and methodology.

Conclusion: KANs offer enhanced expressivity, efficiency, and interpretability. The paper identifies research gaps and provides practical guidance for developing and implementing KANs.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiMAE, a self-supervised learning framework that enhances wearable sensor data analysis by creating multi-resolution embeddings for better prediction and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable health sensors produce rich time-series data, yet effective utilization due to unclear principles governing predictive utility is a challenge. The authors aimed to investigate how temporal resolution influences representation learning and predictive performance.

Method: The authors proposed the HiMAE framework which combines masked autoencoding with hierarchical convolutional encoder-decoder to create embeddings at multiple temporal scales, enabling systematic evaluation of predictive signals.

Result: HiMAE consistently surpasses state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks while being significantly smaller and efficient, compatible with real-time and on-device computations on smartwatch CPUs.

Conclusion: HiMAE advances self-supervised representation learning by making temporal resolution a probe for interpretability, unlocking scale-sensitive structures in wearable data. It is small, fast, and appropriate for edge-level inference applications.

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property

that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision influences transformer models' learning dynamics and performance on symbolic reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how chain-of-thought supervision impacts transformer learning dynamics and their ability to generalize across tasks of varying complexity.

Method: Pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity. Comparing two training setups: final answers only vs. explicit CoT traces along with answers. Using logistic curve modeling to analyze learning speed and dynamics.

Result: CoT improves task performance and generalization, but its effectiveness varies depending on task complexity. Early training phases show models producing correct answers without fully faithful CoT steps.

Conclusion: CoT supervision enhances learning speed and task performance but has limitations for high-complexity tasks. Models eventually align their reasoning traces with answers during training, and CoT influences internal transformer computation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReSpec, a system to adapt speculative decoding (SD) to reinforcement learning (RL) for faster and more efficient large language model (LLM) adaptation, achieving up to 4.5x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in RL training for LLMs caused by slow generation stages and unexplored integration of speculative decoding (SD).

Method: The authors propose ReSpec, incorporating three mechanisms: dynamic SD configuration tuning, drafter evolution via knowledge distillation, and weighted updates based on rollout rewards.

Result: ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup on Qwen models (3B--14B) while maintaining reward convergence and training stability.

Conclusion: ReSpec offers a practical and efficient solution for improving RL-based LLM adaptation, speeding up training without sacrificing stability or performance.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to identify and correct biases in multi-agent systems, describing the limits of such corrections. It presents the ABLOC algorithm to optimize bias-correction and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems often experience performance degradation due to unknown biases affected by environmental conditions, leading to significant practical consequences in monitoring, financial predictions, and judgment aggregation.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of the learnability ratio to quantify how much of unknown biases can be learned. It proposes the ABLOC algorithm for bias correction and optimization, integrating theory-backed convergence guarantees.

Result: The authors show that bias correction depends on the learnability ratio, demonstrating through experiments that high learnability ratio systems recover substantial performance improvements (40%-70%), while low ratios offer minimal benefits.

Conclusion: Bias correction in multi-agent systems is feasible and beneficial under specific conditions defined by the learnability ratio. The findings guide system designers when to invest in such corrections versus alternative approaches.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover

### [185] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)
*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a non-myopic approach using reinforcement learning (RL) for ride-pooling systems, which improves service efficiency and reduces costs for operators and passengers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of myopic decision-making in ride-pooling services, which fails to consider the long-term effects of dispatch decisions.

Method: The authors propose a simulation-informed RL approach, embedding ride-pooling simulation into learning mechanisms for non-myopic decision-making. They also introduce a rebalancing policy for idle vehicles and use n-step temporal difference learning.

Result: The proposed non-myopic policy improved service rates by up to 8.4%, reduced fleet size by over 25%, and cut wait time, in-vehicle time, while maintaining high service performance. Rebalancing further enhanced these outcomes with notable reductions in wait and travel times.

Conclusion: Non-myopic and rebalancing policies provide substantial improvements in efficiency, service rates, and cost savings for ride-pooling systems, addressing challenges of traditional myopic decision-making.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

*Darius Masoum Zadeh-Jousdani,Elvin Hajizada,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), a biologically-inspired algorithm for efficient online learning in robotic systems operating at the edge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems in edge environments require adaptable and computationally efficient online learning algorithms. Traditional methods like backpropagation are computationally expensive and biologically implausible, while Predictive Coding (PC) provides an alternative but still suffers from computational overhead.

Method: The authors propose PCN-TA, which utilizes temporal amortization to preserve latent states across frames. This approach reduces the need for multiple inference iterations by exploiting temporal correlations during training.

Result: Experiments on the COIL-20 dataset show that PCN-TA reduces weight updates by 10% compared to backpropagation and inference steps by 50% compared to baseline PC networks.

Conclusion: PCN-TA reduces computational costs for online learning in resource-constrained environments, offering a significant step toward real-time adaptation for edge-deployed robotic systems. It also shows promise for integration with neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

*Chuyan Chen,Chenyang Ma,Zhangxin Li,Yutong He,Yanjie Dong,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARC-Top-K, an innovative gradient compressor for distributed learning that improves efficiency by aligning sparsity patterns, providing faster training times and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication bottlenecks in large-scale distributed ML caused by inefficiencies in existing gradient compression techniques.

Method: ARC-Top-K aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight gradient sketch for index-free All-Reduce, ensuring global information preservation and provably contractive properties.

Result: ARC-Top-K achieves linear speedup, sharper convergence rates compared to EF21M, matches accuracy of Top-K, and reduces training time by up to 60.7%.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K offers a scalable, efficient, and robust gradient compression solution that combines the strengths of both Rand-K and Top-K methods to alleviate communication bottlenecks in distributed ML.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

*Jin Seong,Jiyun Park,Wencke Liermann,Hongseok Choi,Yoonji Nam,Hyun Kim,Soojong Lim,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemEIC, a method for continual and compositional knowledge editing in large vision-language models (LVLMs), addressing multimodal and sequential knowledge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to continuously update LVLMs stems from the dynamic nature of information. Existing techniques focus on individual modalities, neglecting the multimodality and continuous refinement inherent to LVLMs.

Method: MemEIC utilizes a hybrid external-internal editor, combining dual external memory for cross-modal retrieval and dual LoRA adapters for disentangled updates in each modality. It also employs a brain-inspired knowledge connector for compositional reasoning across modalities.

Result: Experiments show MemEIC improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively retains prior edits.

Conclusion: MemEIC advances continual and compositional knowledge editing in LVLMs, establishing an improved benchmark for editing multimodal models.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

### [189] [Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) under wireless heterogeneity and proposes new strategies to address the bias-variance challenge in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for non-convex objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OTA-FL designs assume homogeneous wireless conditions or force zero-bias updates for convergence, which do not hold in heterogeneous wireless scenarios and limit effectiveness. Modern AI models are also typically non-convex, which prior biased OTA-FL analyses do not address.

Method: The authors develop structured, time-invariant model bias updates for OTA-FL with SGD to balance variance. They also propose a non-convex joint power control optimization approach, solved using a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in accelerating convergence and improving generalization on a non-convex image classification task compared to prior OTA-FL baselines.

Conclusion: The study provides a new pathway for addressing wireless heterogeneity in OTA-FL, optimizing the bias-variance tradeoff, and achieving better performance on non-convex AI applications.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

*Jialong Sun,Xinpeng Ling,Jiaxuan Zou,Jiawen Kang,Kejia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of spectral bias in multivariate time series prediction models and proposes the FreLE algorithm to improve model generalization through frequency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify understanding and address the spectral bias phenomenon in long-term time series prediction models.

Method: Empirical experiments were conducted to measure the spectral bias in existing models, followed by the development of the FreLE algorithm, a plug-and-play loss function unit for frequency regularization.

Result: The FreLE algorithm exhibits superior performance in mitigating spectral bias across a variety of experiments.

Conclusion: Spectral bias is a universal characteristic across models, and FreLE demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing generalization in multivariate time series prediction tasks.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

### [191] [Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801)
*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPECS, a framework for cold start reinforcement learning in vision-language models that enhances generalization and RL performance, avoiding instruction-style overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing cold start paradigms which suffer from instruction-style overfitting and weak generalization in vision-language models.

Method: The proposed method, SPECS, uses self-distilled preference data pairs, preference-based training emphasizing transferable criteria, and decouples learning to improve generalization and RL outcomes.

Result: SPECS improves performance across multimodal benchmarks, including MEGA-Bench (+4.1%) and MathVista (+12.2%), while promoting better exploration and training stability.

Conclusion: Decoupling multimodal learning and utilizing self-distilled preference-based methods can significantly enhance both the generalization and reinforcement learning capabilities of vision-language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

*Hong Wang,Haiyang Xin,Jie Wang,Xuanze Yang,Fei Zha,Huanshuo Dong,Yan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoE-POT, a novel neural operator architecture for pre-training on heterogeneous PDE datasets, offering improved efficiency and reduced error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of heterogeneous equation types and high inference costs in pre-training neural operators for solving PDE problems.

Method: The proposed MoE-POT employs a sparse-activated architecture with layer-wise router-gating networks to dynamically select specific experts suited for PDE types. It combines routed and shared experts to effectively capture both equation-specific and common PDE properties.

Result: MoE-POT, with 90M activated parameters, achieves a 40% reduction in zero-shot error compared to existing models with 120M parameters. It also exhibits interpretability by linking the router-gating network decisions to dataset types.

Conclusion: The MoE-POT model is efficient and effective in handling heterogeneous PDE datasets while reducing computational costs and ensuring interpretability of its decisions.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO proposes a framework leveraging the preimage structure of soft prompts to efficiently optimize instructions for black-box LLMs. It achieves significant optimization success with reduced query budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance optimization efficiency of instructions for black-box LLMs by reinterpreting the many-to-one mapping of soft prompts as a beneficial structure.

Method: The proposed framework has three components: 1) score sharing within preimages, 2) preimage-based initialization for better search space coverage, and 3) score consistency regularization within preimages.

Result: The method effectively utilizes preimages to obtain 14x more scored data within the same query budget, leading to highly efficient optimization.

Conclusion: Experimental analysis on 33 tasks showcases PRESTO's superior performance and innovative approach to instruction optimization for black-box LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff enhances resolution of text-to-image diffusion models without additional training by introducing efficient Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA), Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM), and Structure Guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degraded performance of text-to-image diffusion models at resolutions beyond their training limit without requiring additional training, as current methods are computationally intensive or incompatible with Diffusion Transformers.

Method: Developed ScaleDiff, leveraging Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA) to reduce computational redundancy, Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) for fine details, and applying Structure Guidance for improved global structure during image generation.

Result: ScaleDiff delivers superior image quality and inference speed compared to other training-free methods using both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff provides an efficient and model-agnostic technique to improve image generation resolution in pretrained diffusion models, showcasing state-of-the-art performance without training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedVLSynther, a framework for synthesizing high-quality medical visual question answering (VQA) datasets from open biomedical literature, improving large multimodal models' accuracy across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large, openly usable, and high-quality corpora hampers the development of general medical VQA systems that reason over images and text.

Method: The paper uses MedVLSynther, a generator-verifier pipeline to create multiple-choice VQA questions from open biomedical literature based on figures, captions, and references. The verifier ensures the questions' quality via checks like clinical validity and consistency.

Result: MedSynVQA was generated with 13,087 audited questions and 14,803 images. Training models with this dataset achieves improved accuracy across medical VQA benchmarks, surpassing existing medical LMMs.

Conclusion: MedVLSynther provides a scalable and privacy-preserving method for creating medical VQA training datasets using open literature.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in estimating causal effects when unobserved confounders are present and the causal effect varies across domains, aiming to improve real-world applications.

Method: The authors assume access to a proxy for the hidden confounder and work with discrete variables. They propose two estimation techniques, prove their consistency, derive confidence intervals, and validate their methods theoretically and empirically.

Result: The proposed methods are shown to be identifiable, consistent, and validated through simulation and a real-world example on website rankings and consumer choice.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust methodology for estimating causal effects in scenarios with varying domains and unobserved confounders, supported by comprehensive theoretical proofs and empirical demonstrations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

*Kang Chen,Zhihao Liu,Tonghe Zhang,Zhen Guo,Si Xu,Hao Lin,Hongzhi Zang,Quanlu Zhang,Zhaofei Yu,Guoliang Fan,Tiejun Huang,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces $_{	ext{RL}}$, a framework enabling scalable reinforcement learning for flow-based Vision-Language-Action models, significantly improving their performance on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle with scalability due to the difficulties in computing action log-likelihoods during iterative denoising processes when using reinforcement learning.

Method: The $_{	ext{RL}}$ framework includes two RL algorithms: Flow-Noise, which models the denoising process as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP), and Flow-SDE, which integrates denoising with agent-environment interactions using efficient ODE-to-SDE conversion for exploration.

Result: Testing on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks shows substantial improvements in few-shot SFT models, with performance increasing from 57.6% to 97.6% on LIBERO and similar gains for ManiSkill tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of the $_{	ext{RL}}$ framework in enhancing performance and scalability of flow-based VLAs through online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Method: It introduces Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC)-based coreset construction for exploration, a stopping criterion for graph exploration, and a dynamic shift mechanism for exploitation. Additionally, a localized graph rewiring strategy is proposed to enhance label propagation.

Result: Experiments on benchmark classification tasks demonstrated superior performance compared to existing semi-supervised graph-based methods at low label rates.

Conclusion: The introduced methodologies effectively balance exploration and exploitation, improving active learning outcomes in graph-based classification tasks with sparse labeling.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

### [199] [Contrastive Predictive Coding Done Right for Mutual Information Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25983)
*J. Jon Ryu,Pavan Yeddanapudi,Xiangxiang Xu,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques InfoNCE as a mutual information (MI) estimator, introduces InfoNCE-anchor for better MI estimation, and unites various objectives under a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE is widely used as an MI estimator despite its limitations. The authors aim to address its flaws and improve MI estimation methods.

Method: The authors modify InfoNCE by introducing an anchor class (InfoNCE-anchor) and generalize the framework using proper scoring rules, enabling more accurate and consistent MI estimation.

Result: The InfoNCE-anchor improves MI estimation accuracy and reduces bias, but does not enhance downstream task performance in self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: Although accurate MI estimation is achieved via InfoNCE-anchor, the benefit of contrastive representation learning lies in structured density ratios, not directly from precise MI estimation.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

### [200] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the implicit bias of incremental Adam in logistic regression, revealing that its convergence behavior differs from full-batch Adam and depends on dataset structure and batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limited theoretical understanding of Adam, the widespread optimizer in deep learning, specifically focusing on how batching schemes influence its implicit bias.

Method: The study constructs structured datasets to analyze incremental Adam, develops a proxy algorithm for its behavior as β2 approaches 1, and compares it to the optimizer Signum for different batch sizes.

Result: Incremental Adam converges to the $l_2$-max-margin classifier in certain datasets, unlike the $l_infty$-max-margin bias shown in full-batch Adam. Signum consistently aligns with $l_infty$-max-margin regardless of batch size.

Conclusion: The implicit bias of Adam varies with dataset structure and batching, but Signum's behavior is invariant across batch sizes, emphasizing its robustness compared to Adam.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques fixed unsupervised pool representations in active learning and proposes task-driven representations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised representations in active learning miss task-relevant details, especially for messy, uncurated datapools.

Method: The paper introduces task-driven representations updated during active learning with strategies like semi-supervised learning and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed methods outperform approaches using unsupervised or pretrained representations empirically.

Conclusion: Task-driven, updated representations offer improved adaptability and relevance for messy datatypes in active learning.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

### [202] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates sampling from posterior distributions in noisy linear measurements, focusing on log-concave distributions. It proposes combining diffusion models with annealed Langevin dynamics to achieve conditional sampling in polynomial time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to accurately sample from posterior distributions for applications such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, despite computational challenges and score estimation errors.

Method: The method combines diffusion models with an annealed version of Langevin dynamics, which relaxes the strict requirements on score estimation errors compared to classical Langevin dynamics.

Result: It is demonstrated that the proposed combination enables conditional sampling in polynomial time, requiring a less stringent $L^4$ bound on score errors.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that using diffusion models with annealed Langevin dynamics offers a computationally feasible approach for posterior sampling in log-concave distributions.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

### [203] [Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934)
*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InvGNN-WM, a watermark methodology for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that enables robust and trigger-free ownership verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing watermarks for GNNs often rely on backdoor triggers, which are fragile under model edits and can create ownership ambiguity.

Method: The paper proposes a method tying ownership verification to a GNN's implicit understanding of a graph invariant, using a separate lightweight prediction head, decoder, and threshold to validate ownership without impacting task performance.

Result: InvGNN-WM achieves higher watermark accuracy compared to trigger- and compression-based techniques while maintaining the clean accuracy of GNN models. It is resilient to common model modifications such as pruning, fine-tuning, quantization, and knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM offers a robust, trigger-free watermark solution for GNNs with strong imperceptibility and resilience, providing guarantees that exact removal of the watermark is computationally infeasible.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a scalable and reversible method for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers that avoids the limitations of traditional hashing and one-hot encoding methods.

Method: MLT employs modular arithmetic over finite fields and invertible linear transformations to preserve bijective mappings while offering control over dimensionality and computational scalability.

Result: Experimental evidence from the MovieLens 20M dataset demonstrates that MLT achieves comparable predictive performance to supervised embeddings with reduced parameter usage and lower training costs.

Conclusion: The proposed MLT method is a scalable and efficient alternative for encoding categorical data, delivering reduced computational overhead while preserving reversibility and predictive performance. Open-source implementation is provided.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

*Youssef Attia El Hili,Albert Thomas,Malik Tiomoko,Abdelhakim Benechehab,Corentin Léger,Corinne Ancourt,Balázs Kégl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform model and hyperparameter selection using interpretable dataset metadata, showcasing LLMs as potential assistants for these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the right model and hyperparameters in machine learning is critical but often requires expert knowledge or costly searches. The study aims to explore if LLMs can simplify this process as meta-learners.

Method: The researchers convert datasets into interpretable metadata and employ LLM prompting strategies: (1) zero-shot mode using pretrained knowledge, and (2) meta-informed mode using historical examples to recommend models and hyperparameters.

Result: Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, LLMs were able to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, particularly excelling in meta-informed prompting mode, demonstrating their meta-learning capability.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as lightweight tools for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, reducing reliance on expensive search methods or expert intuition.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study tested Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) for predicting health outcomes in Malawi and found they improve predictions compared to traditional methods for many indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Routine health data in LMICs often face issues like reporting delays and incomplete coverage, necessitating exploration of alternative data sources such as GeoFMs.

Method: Three GeoFM embedding sources (PDFM, AlphaEarth, and mobile phone CDR) were evaluated using XGBoost models on health data from Malawi, with performance assessed through R2 and 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: The Multi-GeoFM model showed the best predictions for health indicators like population density, new HIV cases, and child vaccinations, though performance was poor for areas with limited data availability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating multiple GeoFM sources can improve health data systems in LMICs, offering a promising approach to address reliability issues.

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

*Alvaro Velasquez,Susmit Jha,Ismail R. Alkhouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys the use of neural networks for optimization tasks without training data, focusing on methods like MLPs, convolutional, graph, and quadratic neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of robust data-driven learning approaches and limited availability of training data in fields like combinatorial optimization and scientific applications.

Method: Categorizes the dataless optimization setting into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific methods, analyzing how problem instances are encoded into neural networks.

Result: Defines the dataless setting, examines its application across neural architectures, and provides distinctions with concepts like zero-shot learning and over-parameterization.

Conclusion: Neural networks show promising potential in dataless optimization, offering solutions in areas where training data is scarce or unavailable.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

### [208] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortcuts in deep networks hinder generalization by causing accuracy degradation. This paper investigates their layer-wise localization and role in feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcuts impact the reliability of deep networks but their effect on feature representation is insufficiently studied, hindering the creation of effective mitigation strategies.

Method: The authors designed experiments analyzing layer-wise contributions to accuracy degradation by training networks on clean versus skewed data. They used CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA datasets on architectures like VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt.

Result: Shortcut learning is distributed across networks, with shallow layers encoding spurious features and deeper layers forgetting core predictive features. Challenges in designing general shortcut-mitigation strategies were also discussed.

Conclusion: Shortcut mitigation requires dataset- and architecture-specific approaches due to the distributed nature of shortcuts across network layers.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

*Giulia DeSalvo,Clara Mohri,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a budgeted deferral framework for training deferral algorithms that minimize expert query costs while optimizing predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deferral algorithms require querying all experts for each training instance, resulting in unsustainable costs when expert queries are expensive.

Method: Proposes new algorithms for selective expert querying during training under both two-stage and single-stage deferral frameworks with theoretical guarantees on generalization and label complexity.

Result: The proposed algorithms significantly reduce training costs while maintaining prediction accuracy across different domains.

Conclusion: Budget-aware deferral algorithms offer an efficient and feasible approach for integrating costly experts into machine learning systems without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced framework for integrating differentiable optimization into learning and control systems using DiffOpt.jl within Julia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the integration of differentiable optimization into learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems while addressing challenges related to solver specialization and interface mismatches.

Method: The framework differentiates the KKT system, under standard regularity assumptions, to compute solution sensitivities for smooth, potentially nonconvex programs. It uses a JuMP-native API to handle parameters, simplifying bookkeeping processes.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates capabilities on a range of optimization problems (convex and nonconvex). It is applied to economic dispatch, portfolio selection, robot inverse kinematics, and other applications, showing its impact at scale in gradient-based methods and end-to-end optimization proxy training.

Conclusion: DiffOpt.jl integrates differentiable optimization seamlessly into existing ecosystems, allowing experimentation and large-scale applications using standard modeling practices and solver libraries.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper contrasts the associative view of parametric memory in sequence modeling with a geometric perspective, showing that neural networks synthesize global relationships that simplify reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing notion of memory as a brute-force lookup in sequence modeling and to explore an alternative geometric perspective for understanding how parametric memory is stored and utilized.

Method: The authors isolated Transformer reasoning and analyzed its behavior to demonstrate synthesis of geometric representations. They further examined the connection to Node2Vec to explore the origins of these geometries and spectral bias.

Result: The analysis reveals that Transformers synthesize a global geometry of atomic facts, simplifying complex reasoning tasks and creating memory structures that are elegant and unique.

Conclusion: Transformers naturally learn geometric structures for memory, which calls for revisiting conventional intuitions on sequence modeling and encourages exploration of more geometric approaches for knowledge transfer and memory optimization.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

*Harin Lee,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces INFEX, a framework for infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing limitations of continuous exploration and purely greedy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully adaptive methods continuously explore, which can be impractical or unethical in certain domains, while purely greedy strategies often fail without sufficient contextual diversity.

Method: INFEX combines greedy actions with infrequent execution of a base exploratory policy, which is scheduled. It integrates any existing adaptive exploration method and restricts exploration to limited intervals.

Result: INFEX achieves state-of-the-art regret performance and improved runtime efficiency, verified both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: INFEX effectively balances exploration and exploitation, offering computational and practical advantages while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis, enhancing personalized risk predictions based on patient characteristics and temporal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of modeling patient heterogeneity and adapting risk predictions to individual characteristics and temporal dynamics in survival analysis.

Method: The method involves introducing a dual MoE framework combining a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-specific representation and a hazard MoE for capturing temporal dynamics using patient features and time embeddings.

Result: Experiments on METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with up to a 0.04 increase in the time-dependent C-index on test sets and further gains when integrated into the Consurv framework.

Conclusion: The proposed dual MoE approach effectively improves survival analysis models, offering flexibility and better performance in adapting to patient-specific temporal risk dynamics.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

*Semyon Lomaso,Judah Goldfeder,Mehmet Hamza Erol,Matthew So,Yao Yan,Addison Howard,Nathan Kutz,Ravid Shwartz Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether AI systems genuinely understand human concepts or mimic surface patterns using a chess-playing AI system as the case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI systems achieve genuine conceptual understanding or rely on memorized, pattern-based strategies, especially in tasks involving human-like creativity such as chess.

Method: The authors analyzed a 270M-parameter transformer achieving grandmaster-level play, conducted concept recognition tests via a Chess960 dataset, and performed layer-wise evaluations of the AI's representation of strategic chess concepts.

Result: Early layers model human-like concepts with up to 85% accuracy, but deeper layers develop representations that diverge into non-human alignments, with accuracy dropping to 50-65%. Chess960 tests show a 10-20% decrease in recognition accuracy, indicating over-reliance on memorized patterns.

Conclusion: AI systems optimize for peak performance but lose alignment with human conceptual frameworks, posing challenges for applications requiring true human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation (KD) undermines debiasing capabilities in models, impacting robustness; solutions are proposed to mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of knowledge distillation on debiasing capabilities and model robustness to spurious correlations.

Method: Extensive experiments analyzing KD across NLI and image classification tasks, pinpointing internal attention patterns and circuit behavior post-distillation.

Result: Key findings include diminishing debiasing capabilities post-KD, varied robustness against biases, and identification of internal model factors influencing debiasing.

Conclusion: This is the first large-scale study revealing KD's impact on debiasing; proposed solutions include advanced data augmentation, iterative KD, and improved student model initialization with teacher weights.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates scaling laws in symbolic regression (SR) through a deep learning-based transformer pipeline, revealing predictable trends in performance based on computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scaling effects in symbolic regression (SR), aiming for scientific insights and interpretable models for tabular data, inspired by scaling laws in language modeling.

Method: A systematic investigation using scalable end-to-end transformer architecture, diverse training data, and examining compute power across model sizes.

Result: Validation loss and solved rate display power-law trends with compute; optimal hyperparameter scaling was identified.

Conclusion: SR performance scales predictably with compute, offering key insights for improving future SR models.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

### [217] [Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel machine learning paradigm that dynamically shapes model space geometry using metric tensor optimization on a manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional fixed-geometry parameter optimization in machine learning and explore adaptive model spaces for improved expressiveness.

Method: Proposes a variational framework to optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold. The continuous manifold is discretized using triangular meshes for computational efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates a connection between their approach and the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity, highlighting increased expressiveness of dynamic geometries.

Conclusion: The approach enables the development of dynamic meta-learners with potential applications in scientific discovery and robust learning systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

TL;DR: This paper reviews 72 studies since 2018 on synthetic financial data generation emphasizing the dominance of GAN-based approaches and the need for improved privacy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of using sensitive financial data in machine learning by exploring synthetic data solutions that mitigate privacy risks and regulatory constraints.

Method: The paper systematically examines 72 studies, categorizing the types of financial data synthesized, the generative methods (e.g., GANs, VAEs), and evaluation strategies for utility and privacy.

Result: GAN-based approaches dominate synthetic financial data generation, focusing on time-series market and tabular credit data. Innovative techniques exist but lack rigorous privacy evaluation.

Conclusion: The review highlights the need for more robust evaluations of privacy safeguards and provides guidance for advancing privacy-preserving synthetic data methods in finance.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nirvana introduces a novel Specialized Generalist Model (SGM) integrating a memory mechanism guided by task specificity, achieving superior performance both in general language tasks and specialized medical applications like MRI reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the adaptability and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for both general tasks and specialized domains using task-aware mechanisms.

Method: Nirvana incorporates a specialized memory mechanism, Task-Aware Memory Trigger, and Specialized Memory Updater to dynamically adjust and optimize task-related parameters based on domain requirements.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Nirvana's competitive or superior performance on general benchmarks and significant improvements in specialized domain tasks such as MRI reconstruction and clinical reporting.

Conclusion: Nirvana enhances LLM adaptability and domain shift handling, providing high-quality outputs for specialized tasks while retaining broad capabilities.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [220] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify bug-inducing commits (BICs) in software, overcoming limitations of traditional patch-based bisection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in traditional bug bisection methods that rely on code changes alone, lack logical analysis, and assume the BIC and patch modify the same functions.

Method: The authors propose a multi-stage pipeline utilizing LLMs for analyzing patch information, comparing candidate commits, and progressively narrowing down options.

Result: The proposed method outperformed the existing solutions by 38%, and the multi-stage pipeline proved more accurate by 60% compared to traditional LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs within a comprehensive pipeline significantly enhances the identification accuracy of bug-inducing commits, overcoming traditional barriers in bug bisection tasks.

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Navigation (AN) and Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), leveraging MARL to improve traffic routing and reduce congestion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban road traffic congestion often worsens due to poor routing algorithms, particularly during peak hours.

Method: The research proposes decentralized MARL models integrated with Graph Attention Networks for routing, using hub-based hierarchical methods for scalability.

Result: AN outperforms SPF and baselines in reducing travel time, while HHAN enhances scalability and achieves significant travel time improvements under heavy traffic.

Conclusion: MARL frameworks optimized for network constraints provide effective, scalable solutions for congestion-aware routing, advancing intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SAFE, a tool for stratified analysis of weather prediction models' performance across geospatial attributes, revealing disparities in forecasting and initiating fairness benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning practices in weather and climate settings rely only on average loss metrics, ignoring disparities due to uneven human development and geography.

Method: Introduction of SAFE package that integrates data domains to stratify model performance by attributes like territory, income, or landcover, enabling in-depth geospatial analysis of predictive fairness.

Result: SAFE reveals disparities in performance across various geospatial and socioeconomic attributes among state-of-the-art AI weather prediction models.

Conclusion: Globally-averaged metrics are insufficient; stratification reveals the fairness and disparities of model predictions, suggesting new paths for evaluating and improving weather prediction models.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

TL;DR: CorVS is a deep learning method that matches visual tracking trajectories and wearable sensor data to identify individuals in industrial sites, using a specialized dataset in logistics settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial sites require worker location data to improve productivity, but identifying individuals visually is challenging due to lack of unique appearance cues.

Method: CorVS combines deep learning to predict correspondence probabilities and reliabilities, and an algorithm to match trajectories and sensor data over time.

Result: Developed a real-world dataset and validated CorVS's effectiveness in industrial applications, particularly in logistics warehouses.

Conclusion: CorVS bridges the challenges in identifying individuals using visual and wearable sensor data in dynamic, real-world scenarios, enhancing practicality in industrial settings.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), a reinforcement learning approach designed to improve large language models' reasoning abilities by leveraging their incorrect past responses instead of external expert guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) techniques are limited by the initial capability of large language models and suffer from exploration stagnation, caused by reliance on self-generated responses and lack of external guidance.

Method: The paper proposes LTE, which uses a trial-and-error approach to improve LLMs. Specifically, LTE incorporates LLMs' self-generated errors and overly long answers into their learning process, removing the need for external expert guidance.

Result: Experiments show that LTE achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline GRPO, increasing Pass@1 by 6.38 and Pass@k by 9.00 on average across six mathematics benchmarks for the Qwen3-4B-Base model.

Conclusion: LTE effectively addresses exploration stagnation, fostering better exploration and exploitation during training, ultimately leading to improved reasoning capabilities in large language models without requiring external guidance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of domain shifts that hinder the deployment of WiFi CSI-based HAR systems in privacy-conscious IoT environments.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a YOLO-based vision model to provide real-time activity labels as supervisory signals for fine-tuning a lightweight CSI-based HAR model in a closed-loop system.

Result: maxVSTAR restores recognition accuracy from 49.14% to 81.51% on uncalibrated hardware, demonstrating successful adaptation to environmental changes.

Conclusion: The study proposes a practical and scalable solution for autonomous, self-supervised HAR in smart environments, proving its effectiveness in mitigating domain shifts.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Conclusion: Substructure-aware alignment is critical for improving molecule-text learning, and MolBridge is a promising framework addressing this gap effectively.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

*Emilio Mastriani,Alessandro Costa,Federico Incardona,Kevin Munari,Sebastiano Spinello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compared advanced and simple methods for anomaly detection in industrial time series, concluding simpler models proved better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective methods for anomaly detection in industrial time series data, specifically focusing on steam turbine systems.

Method: Evaluation of advanced feature engineering techniques, hybrid models, and simple ensemble methods using statistical features and segmented data.

Result: Simple Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble outperformed complex models, achieving high AUC-ROC (0.976) and 100% early detection.

Conclusion: Simpler model architectures with optimized data segmentation offer better performance, robustness, and utility in handling imbalanced and uncertain data scenarios.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

### [229] [A Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Framework for Collaborative Public Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26184)
*Songxin Lei,Qiongyan Wang,Yanchen Zhu,Hanyu Yao,Sijie Ruan,Weilin Ruan,Yuyu Luo,Huaming Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel problem called Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA) and proposes a Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) framework to address it, showcasing improved performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identified a limitation in current public resource allocation methods, which individually optimized resource movement without considering capacity constraints or spatio-temporal dynamics.

Method: The paper formulates the CPRA problem as a potential game and develops a Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) framework to address it, incorporating spatio-temporal system dynamics.

Result: The proposed GSTRL framework demonstrates superior efficiency and performance in solving CPRA problems when tested on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical foundation for addressing CPRA as a potential game and validates the effectiveness of the GSTRL framework, contributing to advancements in resource allocation under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACC-SGD-IE to improve per-sample influence estimation in data-centric AI, addressing flaws in traditional methods like SGD-IE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying influential data samples is crucial for improving model training and addressing noisy data in AI.

Method: The authors propose ACC-SGD-IE, an estimator that considers trajectory-aware effects and updates influence states step-by-step.

Result: ACC-SGD-IE provides better influence estimates than SGD-IE across multiple datasets, especially for long epochs and noisy data cleansing.

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE enhances data-centric AI models by more effectively identifying noisy samples and improving training outcomes.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

TL;DR: Hospital readmission rates are used to evaluate healthcare quality. The study employs machine learning models to predict readmissions, with Random Forest outperforming Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing hospital readmissions is crucial for improving healthcare quality and lowering healthcare costs; identifying factors causing readmissions can aid in better targeting interventions.

Method: Machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) were used on health claims data, combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Result: Random Forest achieved the highest AUC performance, followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.

Conclusion: Machine learning models are effective in identifying factors influencing hospital readmissions, providing actionable insights for improving healthcare quality and reducing costs.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

TL;DR: This paper introduces adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits (AISP), a novel test-time alignment method for large language models (LLMs) that optimizes reward through Gaussian perturbation and importance sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs often requires high computational costs, so finding alternatives for effective test-time alignment is highly desirable.

Method: The authors propose AISP, which introduces Gaussian perturbations to pre-logits (outputs from the penultimate layer) and uses sampling-based model predictive control to maximize expected rewards.

Result: AISP achieves superior rewards compared to best-of-n sampling and other reward-based test-time alignment methods, with better efficiency in using samples.

Conclusion: AISP proves to be effective in test-time alignment by outperforming existing methods, showcasing its potential as a computationally efficient alternative for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel inductive approach to machine unlearning that reverses the last training sequence for effective, scalable, and practical knowledge removal without needing complete access to the original dataset or model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability issues and practical limitations such as needing full access to datasets and models in existing machine unlearning solutions.

Method: The proposed approach treats classification training as a sequential process, enabling unlearning by reversing the last training sequence. A projection-redistribution layer is used to facilitate modular and model-agnostic deployment.

Result: Experimental results show that this method achieves outputs consistent with fully retrained models while significantly reducing computational costs across various datasets.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable, practical, compatible with existing systems, and maintains performance without requiring substantial modifications to classification pipelines.

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Angular Steering, a refined method to control behaviors in language models by rotating activations, and demonstrates robust control without compromising general abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling behaviors in large language models while preserving their general performance is essential for deploying safe and reliable artificial intelligence systems.

Method: Angular Steering modulates behavior by geometrically rotating activations within a fixed subspace. It also introduces Adaptive Angular Steering for selective rotations and enhanced stability.

Result: Experiments across various models showed Angular Steering provides continuous control over specific behaviors like refusal and emotion modulation without affecting general language modeling performance.

Conclusion: Angular Steering simplifies existing methods by offering robust, fine-grained behavioral control under a unified framework, enhancing flexibility, stability, and generalization.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Søren Hauberg,Tom Fletcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a general interpolation scheme for generative models, enabling controlled generation and model inspection without restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often lack a principal way to handle interpolants, limiting their capability for controlled generation and model exploration.

Method: The paper introduces a method for computing geodesic-like interpolants constrained to a data distribution, based on a novel algorithm requiring no additional training.

Result: The interpolation scheme demonstrated better performance by traversing higher density regions compared to baseline approaches across models and datasets.

Conclusion: This research establishes a general interpolation framework for generative models, enhancing their utility in controlled generation and model analysis.

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

*Kim Yong Tan,Yueming Lyu,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IMG algorithm to optimize diffusion models at inference-time for efficient high-dimensional multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of diffusion models in solving multi-objective optimization tasks by addressing limitations of existing methods that treat diffusion models as black-box refiners.

Method: The IMG algorithm optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time using weighted resampling based on aggregated multi-objective values, aligning samples with a desired Boltzmann distribution.

Result: IMG demonstrated superior performance in a molecule generation task, achieving higher hypervolume with a single generation pass compared to methods requiring many generations.

Conclusion: The IMG approach is an efficient optimization method for diffusion processes, offering integration potential for enhancing existing algorithms.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multi-task learning in contextual bandits, developing algorithms that improve decision-making by capturing heterogeneity and correlations across instances, with strong experimental performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing decision-making across related tasks in contextual bandits by leveraging shared structures and accommodating heterogeneity.

Method: The study proposes a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework, estimating covariance structures empirically, and develops two algorithms, ebmTS and ebmUCB, based on this framework.

Result: The proposed algorithms exhibit lower cumulative regret and superior performance in balancing exploration and exploitation compared to existing methods, validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The hierarchical Bayesian framework effectively improves multi-task learning in contextual bandits, demonstrating significant practical benefits in complex environments.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

*Jingyuan Liu,Fatemeh Ghaffari,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for offline preference learning in settings with limited user interactions and diverse preferences. It addresses challenges like clustering users by preference and handling imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline preference learning is needed in scenarios where user interactions are costly or limited, and multiple users have different preferences, causing challenges in data aggregation and handling imbalanced data.

Method: The paper introduces Off-C$^2$PL, a method for pure offline learning, and A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, which incorporates active-data augmentation to improve learning with imbalanced data and enhance understanding of test user preferences.

Result: Theoretical analysis is provided, demonstrating bounds on suboptimality and effective data aggregation. Simulations validate the algorithms' efficacy on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods address challenges in offline preference learning, demonstrating how active and targeted sample collection improves learning outcomes in scenarios with diverse preferences and limited data.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a token-aware causal framework for analyzing CLIP's shortcomings. It identifies the cause of limitations in compositional reasoning as 'composition nonidentifiability' and proposes improvements in language-token granularity and negative mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of CLIP's compositional reasoning with a theoretical framework and to better model token-level structures in text.

Method: Developed a causal representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a tokenized text-based SCM and extended block identifiability to token level.

Result: The analysis highlights CLIP's difficulty in compositional reasoning and attributes it to composition nonidentifiability, establishing why certain visual and textual misalignments occur.

Conclusion: Token granularity reveals insights into CLIP's weaknesses in compositional reasoning. Enhanced strategies, like improved negative mining, are recommended for strengthening performance.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for data-free continual learning (CL) using an innovative model inversion technique called Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI), combined with feature modeling to preserve prior knowledge and enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of continual learning without storing or replaying prior data, which is infeasible for privacy reasons or large pre-trained models like CLIP.

Method: The authors propose PMI for faster convergence in generating synthetic data via model inversion and incorporate Gaussian distributions with contrastive modeling to align synthetic data features with real ones to mitigate feature drift.

Result: Their approach demonstrates strong performance across multiple CL settings by enabling the generation of effective pseudo-images for new class learning, ensuring knowledge retention and compatibility.

Conclusion: This paper offers an efficient and effective solution to data-free continual learning challenges, improving the alignment and quality of synthetic data while reducing computational load.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of quantum annealing in SVM training formulated as a QUBO problem, showing competitive performance even with low-precision encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to leverage quantum annealing for efficient SVM optimization by exploring its potential to enhance predictive performance and computational efficiency compared to classical methods.

Method: The study compares QUBO-based SVM training with classical LIBSVM by varying the discretization level (number of qubits) for dual weights and analyzing its effects across datasets.

Result: Findings show that even low-precision QUBO encodings produce competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical LIBSVM, but enhanced bit-depth does not consistently improve classification.

Conclusion: Quantum annealing shows promise for efficient SVM training, with proper selection of support vectors playing a pivotal role, despite current hardware limitations.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

*David Schmotz,Sahar Abdelnabi,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights critical security vulnerabilities in the 'Agent Skills' framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable prompt injection attacks to exfiltrate sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the security of the newly introduced 'Agent Skills' framework in LLMs and determine its effectiveness against prompt injection vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors analyzed the implementation of Agent Skills, designed malicious instructions within skill files, and tested vulnerabilities by simulating attacks, such as exfiltrating sensitive data.

Result: The study demonstrates that Agent Skills are fundamentally insecure, allowing for simple prompt injections that bypass system-level safeguards and obtain sensitive data.

Conclusion: Despite advancements in LLM capabilities, critical security weaknesses persist in frameworks like Agent Skills. Future efforts should emphasize securing LLMs against prompt injection attacks before deployment.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces interventional constraints in causal discovery to encode high-level causal knowledge as inequality constraints on causal effects, improving model accuracy and consistency with known causal influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance causal models and improve downstream tasks such as treatment design by ensuring accuracy and integrating causal knowledge effectively.

Method: Proposes interventional constraints and defines them in terms of inequality constraints on causal effects. The problem is framed as a constrained optimization task and solved with a two-stage optimization method.

Result: The approach improves model accuracy and consistency with established causal knowledge, enhances explainability, and facilitates discovery of new causal relationships.

Conclusion: Integrating interventional constraints improves causal discovery by aligning with known influences, increasing model reliability, and helping identify novel causal relationships.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

*Sebastian Zieglmeier,Niklas Erdmann,Narada D. Warakagoda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper modifies classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods to efficiently work in sparse, random, and nonstationary environments, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of RL algorithms struggling in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments, such as underwater pollution cloud search.

Method: A modified Monte Carlo-based approach was developed using hierarchical changes, multi-goal learning, and location memory to improve RL performance.

Result: The modified approach significantly outperformed traditional Q-learning and exhaustive search methods in complex environments.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning techniques can be effectively adapted to tackle sparse, randomized, and nonstationary environments by revising classical approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces UnifiedFL, a federated learning framework that enables collaborative training across clients with different architectures and non-identical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing FL frameworks in handling architectures and non-identically distributed datasets, while focusing on enhancing model generalizability in domain-hybrid scenarios.

Method: UnifiedFL uses a graph model where heterogeneous client networks are represented using a graph neural network (GNN). It employs parameterized clustering via Euclidean distances and a two-tier aggregation policy for balancing diversity and convergence.

Result: UnifiedFL outperformed existing FL methods in experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL provides an effective solution for federated learning among clients with distinct network architectures and datasets, improving model generalizability in diverse domain scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

*Albi Isufaj,Pablo Mollá,Helmut Prendinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for explainable and reliable AI in financial forecasting, focusing on using a time series foundation model, reliability estimation, and symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of large neural network models in financial forecasting and ensure trust and regulatory compliance.

Method: The paper introduces Time-LLM for avoiding wrong directional forecasts, integrates reliability estimators to filter unreliable predictions, and uses symbolic reasoning for transparent justification.

Result: Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data demonstrated reduced false positives and effective selective execution using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework integrates predictive performance, reliability, and rule-based reasoning to improve transparency and auditability in financial AI systems.

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FM-Cast, a generative AI model for predicting Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) efficiently and accurately, demonstrating comparable or superior results to traditional numerical weather prediction systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting SSWs is crucial due to their impact on winter weather and subseasonal predictability, yet accurate predictions remain challenging due to limitations in representation, initialization, and computational demands in current NWP systems.

Method: FM-Cast uses Flow Matching-based generative AI to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric circulation related to SSW events. It is evaluated across 18 major SSW events from 1998 to 2024.

Result: FM-Cast forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 SSW events up to 20 days in advance with ensemble accuracies above 50%, outperforming or matching leading NWP systems while requiring minimal computational resources.

Conclusion: FM-Cast establishes a new, computationally efficient approach for probabilistic forecasting of SSWs and highlights generative AI's capability to enhance understanding of atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

*Wenchang Duan,Yaoliang Yu,Jiwan He,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel MARL framework that dynamically optimizes context length for improved exploration and performance in long-term dependency tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large fixed context lengths in MARL such as reduced exploration efficiency and redundant information.

Method: The paper proposes a central agent using temporal gradient analysis to dynamically optimize context length and employs Fourier-based low-frequency truncation for effective input representation.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tasks such as PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football, and SMACv2.

Conclusion: Adaptive optimization of context length enhances MARL performance, balancing exploration efficiency and filtering redundancy in information representation.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Result: Models based on SVM and TWSVM were assessed, with emerging TWSVM extensions showing promise in MTL contexts.

Conclusion: This research identifies gaps and future directions to develop scalable, interpretable, and reliable SVM- and TWSVM-based MTL frameworks while offering valuable insights for researchers.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

*Yucen Wang,Fengming Zhang,De-Chuan Zhan,Li Zhao,Kaixin Wang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoLA-World, a joint-trained framework for latent action models and pre-trained world models, achieving superior video simulation and visual planning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve integration and interaction between latent action models and pre-trained world models for better controllability and efficiency in video generation.

Method: Develop a joint training approach with a warm-up phase to align latent action models with pre-trained world models, enabling co-evolution between the two models.

Result: CoLA-World achieves comparable or better performance in video simulation quality and visual planning compared to previous two-stage methods.

Conclusion: CoLA-World establishes a new paradigm in controllable world modeling, demonstrating robust and efficient results through joint training of LAM and world models.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty of predicting personalized treatment outcomes for small-sample and rare patient groups due to limited costly trial data in precision medicine.

Method: The researchers propose CFKD-AFN, which includes a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive fusion network. It uses dual-channel knowledge distillation to extract low-fidelity data and an attention-based fusion module for dynamic integration of multi-source information.

Result: CFKD-AFN showed significant improvements in prediction accuracy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment outcomes by 6.67% to 74.55%, demonstrating robustness with varying sizes of high-fidelity datasets.

Conclusion: The CFKD-AFN method not only improves treatment outcome predictions but also allows for an interpretable variant to help explore medical semantics for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of robustness in Graph Condensation (GC) under adversarial perturbations and introduces Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation (MRGC) to enhance GC's effectiveness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Condensation techniques fail under corrupted graph scenarios and adversarial attacks, revealing a critical need to create a more robust approach.

Method: MRGC uses graph data manifold learning modules to guide the condensed graph to a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, maintaining classification complexity reduction while enhancing robustness.

Result: The proposed MRGC framework demonstrates improved robustness across diverse adversarial attack scenarios, while preserving GC performance.

Conclusion: MRGC effectively solves the vulnerability of GC under adversarial perturbations by leveraging manifold learning, ensuring robust and efficient graph condensation.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series anomaly detection is essential for network security. Existing quantum approaches show promise but are limited by hardware constraints like qubit counts.

Method: The study proposes a QGRU-based GAN that employs Successive Data Injection (SuDaI), a gating strategy, quantum-enhanced generator, and Gaussian reparameterization. It incorporates a Wasserstein critic for stable training and uses specific metrics for anomaly identification.

Result: The method achieved high anomaly detection accuracy with a time-series aware F1 score of 89.43% on benchmark datasets. Successful deployment on IBM Quantum hardware showed robustness and feasibility on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: The proposed QGRU-WGAN model demonstrates superior anomaly detection performance while leveraging quantum technology, proving its viability on real quantum hardware.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Motivation: Current heuristic-based data selection methods for RLVR lack theoretical guarantees and generalizability, motivating the need for a more systematic and efficient approach.

Method: The paper uses influence functions with an off-policy influence estimation method, saving computational resources through offline trajectories. Sparse random projection is employed to handle high-dimensional gradients of large language models.

Result: The proposed CROPI framework achieves a 2.66x step-level acceleration on a 1.5B parameter model, while using only 10% of the data per stage, demonstrating efficiency in training large models.

Conclusion: Influence-based data selection significantly improves training efficiency in RLVR, providing theoretical guarantees and scalability for LLMs up to 7B parameters.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the deployment challenges of deep learning models for ECG monitoring due to OOD data, proposing Unsupervised Anomaly Detection as an upstream filtering mechanism to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous ECG monitoring using wearables has great potential for early CVD detection, but resource limitations and OOD data create reliability and safety issues for automated analysis.

Method: The study benchmarks six Unsupervised Anomaly Detection approaches, optimizes them using Neural Architecture Search under resource constraints, and evaluates their performance on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets.

Result: Deep SVDD was identified as the most effective approach, improving diagnostic classifier accuracy by up to 21 percentage points in deployment simulations.

Conclusion: Optimized UAD filters enhance the reliability and safety of automated ECG analysis, supporting seamless continuous CVD monitoring on wearable devices.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICPO, a framework for improving exploration and stability in reinforcement learning for large reasoning models, without relying heavily on advanced expert models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in exploration and computational costs in existing RLVR methods by using the inherent in-context learning capability of LRMs and leveraging existing datasets.

Method: The paper proposes ICPO with components like Mixed-Policy GRPO, Expert Region Reject Sampling, and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to enhance trajectory diversity and stabilize optimization.

Result: ICPO improves reinforcement learning performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ICPO framework successfully expands exploration and stabilizes training, presenting a scalable RLVR paradigm for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel polybasic speculative decoding framework which accelerates inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining output quality, achieving significant speedup ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency in large-scale deployment of LLMs creates bottlenecks, with current speculative decoding methods lacking robust theoretical grounding.

Method: The framework utilizes a polybasic speculative decoding approach, supported by a theoretical analysis. A fundamental theorem is proven for optimal inference time in multi-model systems, optimizing generation and computational cost.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate speedup ratios of 3.31× to 4.01× for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, and similar results for other models like LLaMA3-8B, Vicuna-7B, and Qwen2-7B while maintaining output distribution integrity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully accelerates inference and preserves output distribution, representing a significant advancement over existing methods. The release of proof and code supports future research efforts.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

*Adrien Weihs,Andrea Bertozzi,Matthew Thorpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOHL offers higher-order smoothness on hypergraphs using multiscale Laplacians. This paper provides theoretical advancements and demonstrates its robustness in various learning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical hypergraph regularization and improve learning versatility through higher-order smoothness.

Method: Prove theoretical consistency for truncated HOHL, derive convergence rates, and evaluate its performance empirically across diverse datasets.

Result: Consistent truncated HOHL with demonstrable high performance in supervised and active learning settings, including non-geometric datasets.

Conclusion: HOHL achieves theoretical and practical benefits with versatility across complex learning settings, providing better smoothness and generalization.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

### [259] [A Three-Stage Bayesian Transfer Learning Framework to Improve Predictions in Data-Scarce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26541)
*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN) to improve predictive performance and uncertainty quantification in scenarios with sparse and noisy experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges faced by data-driven engineering models, particularly the limitations of large domain shifts and noisy or sparse datasets.

Method: A fully-supervised three-stage framework combining parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. This includes deterministic feature extraction, adversarial refinement of features, and Bayesian neural network implementation for calibrated uncertainty estimation.

Result: The proposed methodology significantly outperformed standard transfer methods in a synthetic benchmark and demonstrated improved predictive accuracy and generalization in predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels.

Conclusion: The staged B-DANN method provides a robust approach for leveraging transfer learning in data-scarce engineering problems, showing promise for broader applications in nuclear engineering and similar domains.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

*Jan Stenkamp,Nina Herrmann,Benjamin Karic,Stefan Oehmcke,Fabian Gieseke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a compression scheme for boosted decision trees to create lightweight machine learning models optimized for resource-constrained IoT devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing need for memory-efficient machine learning models in compute-constrained IoT environments to enable autonomous device operation.

Method: The authors propose training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that reuse features and thresholds, alongside implementing an alternative memory layout to reduce the memory footprint.

Result: Experimental evaluations indicate that the compressed models maintain performance while achieving a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to LightGBM models.

Conclusion: The proposed compression scheme enables IoT devices to operate autonomously with minimal computing power and energy, paving the way for advanced applications in remote monitoring and edge analytics.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

### [261] [Multiclass Local Calibration With the Jensen-Shannon Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26566)
*Cesare Barbera,Lorenzo Perini,Giovanni De Toni,Andrea Passerini,Andrea Pugnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new concept of multiclass local calibration to improve machine learning (ML) calibration in sparse and high-stakes settings using a novel method and practical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the vulnerability of existing multiclass calibration methods to proximity bias, which leads to miscalibration in sparse regions of the feature space. This is particularly critical in applications like healthcare, where sparse data can result in biased predictions and treatment.

Method: The authors define a new notion of multiclass local calibration, analyze theoretical issues in existing evaluation metrics, and propose a practical approach that improves local calibration in Neural Networks using the Jensen-Shannon distance to align predicted probabilities with local class frequency estimates.

Result: The authors empirically validate their method, demonstrating that it enhances local calibration when compared to existing techniques for multiclass classification.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by addressing the main shortcoming of existing methods in multiclass calibration by introducing and validating a local calibration-focused perspective, aligning predictions more accurately with true-class frequencies in sparse regions.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

*Maksim Maslov,Alexander Kugaevskikh,Matthew Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study tackles the problem of regression over distributions by proposing a method using Bernstein basis to model smooth probability trajectories and minimizing Wasserstein distance for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression over distributions has growing importance in machine learning, but traditional methods struggle with neglecting probability space geometry or being computationally inefficient.

Method: The proposed approach employs Bernstein polynomials for parameterizing Gaussian components and optimizes a loss based on squared Wasserstein distance between predicted and empirical distributions via autodiff-based optimization.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets show competitive performance in approximating complex trajectories with superior smoothness, robustness, and interpretability compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The method offers a balance of geometric precision, efficiency, and interpretability, with potential for extensions to non-Gaussian distributions, entropy regularization, and high-dimensional data applications.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

*Lin Xu,Xinyun Yuan,Yuxuan Liang,Suwan Yin,Yuankai Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Aeolus: a detailed flight delay dataset offering tabular, sequential, and graph data for better delay prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for flight delay prediction are limited to flat tabular structures, lacking the ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics of delay effects and interdependencies.

Method: Aeolus provides three aligned data modalities: tabular data (operational, meteorological, features on 50M flights), a flight chain module for sequential delay modeling, and a flight network graph for cross-flight relational reasoning. It’s designed with temporal splits, rich features, and strict leakage prevention.

Result: Aeolus supports diverse machine learning tasks, including regression, classification, and graph learning, serving as a benchmark for structured data research.

Conclusion: Aeolus significantly enhances flight delay modeling potential for domain-specific and structured data research, while providing baselines and tools for adoption.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

*Colin Doumont,Victor Picheny,Viacheslav Borovitskiy,Henry Moss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework based on heat kernels for Bayesian Optimization (BO) in combinatorial tasks, simplifying existing combinatorial kernel approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BO can solve various combinatorial tasks, but requires tailored kernels for effective modeling, prompting the need to understand relationships among existing kernels.

Method: Developing a unifying framework using heat kernels with theoretical derivations and experimental validations.

Result: Proves many successful combinatorial kernels correspond to heat kernels and demonstrates heat kernels' robustness and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Heat kernels streamline and enhance BO performance by overcoming limitations of prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the real-world impact of AI on economic value and automation, bridging the gap between research benchmarks and practical applications.

Method: The authors developed the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a benchmark designed to assess AI performance on economically valuable tasks across multiple sectors in real-world settings.

Result: AI agents demonstrated very low performance on the RLI, with the top-performing AI achieving only a 2.5% rate of automation.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that AI's real-world automation capabilities are currently limited, offering a foundation for further tracking and managing AI's impact on labor automation.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value
and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable
projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical
settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing

tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven
labor automation.

*Emmanouil Sylligardos,John Paparrizos,Themis Palpanas,Pierre Senellart,Paul Boniol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates time series classification for model selection in anomaly detection, proposing methods outperforming individual models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection across diverse time series datasets lacks a universal solution. Model selection tailored to time series characteristics is needed to address this challenge.

Method: The study tests 234 model configurations based on 16 base classifiers across 1980+ time series, using time series classification methods for anomaly detection model selection evaluation.

Result: Model selection approaches outperform single anomaly detection methods while maintaining comparable execution times.

Conclusion: This paper establishes the strength of time series classification for anomaly detection model selection and forms a baseline for AutoML pipeline development.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

*Penghui Qi,Zichen Liu,Xiangxin Zhou,Tianyu Pang,Chao Du,Wee Sun Lee,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using FP16 precision instead of BF16 for reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models fixes instability issues and improves overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of LLMs experiences instability caused by numerical mismatches between training and inference policies, primarily due to floating point precision issues.

Method: The study identifies BF16 precision as causing large rounding errors and proposes switching to FP16 precision for better numerical stability. This requires minimal code changes and no architectural modifications.

Result: The use of FP16 yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and better performance across various tasks, RL algorithms, and frameworks.

Conclusion: Switching to FP16 precision effectively resolves RL fine-tuning instability in LLMs and encourages a reevaluation of precision choices in similar applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel method to model non-gradient field dynamics in transport processes using population-level data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to capture non-gradient, periodic behaviors in systems such as cell cycles or ocean currents.

Method: Curly-FM solves Schrödinger bridge problems with non-zero drift processes, constructed through inferred velocities and snapshot data.

Result: Curly-FM successfully models non-gradient dynamics, showing better alignment with reference processes and population distributions.

Conclusion: Curly-FM expands flow matching models to incorporate periodic behaviors, promising advancement in modeling complex physical systems.

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits differential privacy in computing the top singular vectors' span, proposing a simple and efficient algorithm that leverages singular value decomposition and perturbation mechanisms to improve performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the unresolved question of computing private singular vectors' spans under differential privacy, posed by Hardt and Roth, the authors strive to address limitations in prior algorithms, particularly in dense settings.

Method: The study introduces an algorithm using singular value decomposition combined with standard perturbation mechanisms to produce private rank-$r$ approximations with error dependent on rank-$r$ coherence and spectral gap.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves improved performance, even matching optimal non-private algorithm guarantees in dense settings. It preserves rank-$r$ coherence under Gaussian perturbations and applies coherence theory to graph problems like Max-Cut.

Conclusion: The findings provide a significant advancement in differentially private computations, maintaining input coherence and extending applications to structured models and graph-related optimization problems.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique to improve world-models’ predictive performance through better latent representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models are brittle and degrade over long prediction horizons due to poor representation learning, which complicates dynamics modeling.

Method: Proposes Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM) to enhance representation learning by enforcing proximity in latent representation space for sensory trajectory points.

Result: GRWM improves latent representations, significantly enhancing rollout fidelity and stability in deterministic 3D environments and long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Improving representation learning offers a viable path to developing robust world models without requiring larger dynamics modules.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

*Amir Reza Mirzaei,Yuqiao Wen,Yanshuai Cao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant introduces a mixed-precision quantization approach to optimize the storage and efficiency of multiple LoRA adapters without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA adapters are lightweight when used individually, but their combined usage in real-world applications leads to substantial storage costs. Efficient quantization methods are needed.

Method: LoRAQuant employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify important components in the LoRA adapters, quantizing them with high precision while compressing less crucial elements to ultra-low precision.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B show LoRAQuant uses fewer bits compared to other quantization methods and maintains or improves performance across tasks such as mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant provides an effective solution for reducing storage requirements of multiple LoRA adapters while preserving or enhancing task performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Method: Two regularization terms are introduced during network training to recover properties resembling Bayesian estimators (posterior mean and MAP estimator). The theoretical and numerical analysis validates their impact.

Result: The regularization terms align the network's outputs with Bayesian estimators, shaping both the forward and inverse mappings in a stable, interpretable manner.

Conclusion: Regularization terms enable invertible neural networks to recover Bayesian estimators, improving their application to inverse problems with stability and interpretability.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

### [273] [On the limitation of evaluating machine unlearning using only a single training seed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26714)
*Jamie Lanyon,Axel Finke,Petros Andreou,Georgina Cosma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with empirical evaluation of machine unlearning (MU) algorithms, showing variability based on training seeds and recommending comparisons that account for this variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately assessing and comparing the performance of approximate machine unlearning algorithms.

Method: Analysis of the sensitivity of MU methods to random number seeds in model training, demonstrating variability in performance.

Result: The study reveals high sensitivity of some MU algorithms to training seeds, making standard empirical comparison practices inadequate.

Conclusion: Empirical assessments should include variability across different training seeds to ensure more representative and accurate comparisons of MU methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple perturbation mechanism for pure differential privacy in covariance matrix release, achieving optimal errors for large datasets and improving bounds for small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize differential privacy error guarantees for covariance matrix estimation across all Schatten norms, including spectral norm for large datasets, and improve bounds for smaller datasets.

Method: The mechanism employs perturbation techniques for covariance matrices and, for small datasets, involves projecting the output onto a nuclear norm ball for improved error bounds.

Result: Achieves optimal Frobenius norm error for large datasets, optimal spectral norm error for the first time, and improved Frobenius norm error for smaller datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism enhances error guarantees under pure differential privacy for covariance matrix release across various norms, proving optimal for large datasets while significantly improving bounds for small datasets.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STaMP quantization to enhance activation quantization for generative AI models, maintaining accuracy at lower bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address accuracy degradation in generative AI models when activations are quantized below eight bits.

Method: Introduced STaMP quantization, utilizing sequence dimension linear transformations and mixed precision to optimize lower bit-width quantization.

Result: STaMP improves low-bit activation quantization in generative AI models and complements existing quantization methods.

Conclusion: STaMP effectively mitigates accuracy loss in low-bit activation quantization and enhances overall model performance.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces advanced sampling methods to enhance influence functions (IFs) by reducing computational/memory costs and increasing estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing training data impact on black-box models is critical; current methods for Influence Functions are resource-intensive and inconsistent due to high variance in sampled subsets.

Method: Proposes feature-based and logit-based sampling techniques to create representative subsets for computing IFs more efficiently.

Result: The methods significantly reduce computation time (30.1%), memory usage (42.2%), or improve estimation accuracy (F1-score by 2.5%) compared to traditional sampling.

Conclusion: Advanced sampling techniques offer a practical solution for accurate and resource-efficient Influence Function estimates, improving model analysis with better performance outcomes.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: The paper investigates if pre-trained forecasting models can be repurposed for time series classification tasks and finds promising performance comparable to specialized classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has mainly explored forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models, while their ability to generalize to other tasks, such as classification, remains unclear.

Method: The authors compare representation extraction strategies from pre-trained forecasting models and propose model-agnostic embedding augmentations to test their efficiency for classification.

Result: Best pre-trained forecasting models achieve classification accuracy equivalent or superior to state-of-the-art models specifically trained for classification, indicating a correlation between forecasting and classification performance.

Conclusion: Task-specific pre-training may not be necessary; acquiring forecasting capabilities could enable general-purpose time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the capability of Transformer models to predict sequences from Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a complex type of pseudo-random number generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how Transformers can tackle the challenging properties of PCGs which involve bitwise operations, surpassing classical prediction approaches.

Method: Using Transformers with model sizes up to 50 million parameters, datasets of up to 5 billion tokens, and scaling moduli up to 2^22. Curriculum learning is employed for higher moduli.

Result: Transformers can predict unseen PCG sequences effectively, even with single-bit outputs and across diverse PRNGs. Larger moduli require curriculum learning; input clustering signals structural learning.

Conclusion: Transformers exhibit robust ability to perform in-context learning for PRNGs including PCGs, showing scalable and transferable representations with clustering phenomena.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

TL;DR: Proposes using wireless sensor networks for fully parallel and distributed hardware implementation of artificial neural networks to solve large-scale real-time problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current silicon- or optics-based computing systems cannot achieve massively parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural networks, limiting their application to large-scale, real-time problems.

Method: Utilize wireless sensor networks comprising hundreds of thousands of processing nodes equipped with on-board processing and wireless communication capabilities to implement artificial neural network algorithms.

Result: Real-time computation of large-scale, complex problems becomes achievable using a robust, distributed framework for implementing artificial neural networks.

Conclusion: This approach could revolutionize computing by enabling the practical application of ANN algorithms to solve large-scale scientific and technical challenges efficiently and affordably.

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

Motivation: AI deployment on edge devices faces challenges of high energy consumption and limited functionality, requiring brain-inspired mechanisms for real-time, low-power adaptation.

Method: VDSP is introduced for Hebbian-based local online learning in memristive synapses, demonstrated on three distinct types of memristive devices through simulations with spiking neural networks.

Result: VDSP-based spiking neural networks achieved over 83% accuracy in MNIST-based unsupervised pattern recognition tasks across three device types, with consideration of variability impacts and device optimization strategies.

Conclusion: VDSP offers a promising low-power, efficient solution for brain-inspired learning in edge computing devices, leveraging in-memory computing for improved AI hardware performance.

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

*Kunal Kumar Pant,Remya Ajai A S,Nithin Nagaraj*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Forest fires are devastating, and existing methods using ML and DL often fail to capture the nonlinearity of data. This paper proposes Neurochaos Learning (NL), a brain-inspired algorithm using chaotic neurons, which performs better, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML and DL models for forest fire prediction often lack sufficient accuracy and require extensive amounts of training data. This paper aims to develop a more efficient and interpretable approach for predicting forest fires using minimal data.

Method: The authors propose Neurochaos Learning (NL), utilizing chaos-based one-dimensional neurons with Generalized Lüroth Series (GLS). A variant, Random Heterogeneous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), introduces randomized chaotic neurons to simulate brain-like heterogeneity.

Result: The algorithm performed highly, achieving an F1 score of 1.0 on the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset. It also demonstrated high precision on Canadian and Portugal datasets, outperforming traditional ML classifiers.

Conclusion: Neurochaos Learning (NL) proves to be a promising alternative to traditional ML and DL for forest fire prediction due to its efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, especially in scenarios with limited datasets.

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

Motivation: To address the inefficiency in resource optimization caused by the lack of insight into user workloads in virtualized environments.

Method: Developing System-X, a system that uses hardware signals and an unsupervised learning pipeline to detect anomalies, based on analysis of over 30 ML models on various hardware platforms.

Result: System-X successfully identified network and system configuration issues, achieving a 5.97% acceleration in the DeepSeek model.

Conclusion: System-level optimization in cloud platforms can be achieved without workload knowledge by leveraging hardware-centric approaches like System-X.

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack
ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many
users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient
resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization,
which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This
hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure
cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that
workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose
System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on
hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals
collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised
learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML
models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging
workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully
identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the
DeepSeek model by 5.97%.

*Izzy Grosof,Daniela Hurtado-Lange*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel scheduling policy SEK-SMOD that performs better than the established SRPT-k policy across all loads and job size distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a scheduling policy that improves mean response time without additional resources, surpassing the existing optimal SRPT-k in heavy traffic scenarios.

Method: SEK-SMOD prioritizes large jobs over small ones in specific scenarios, enhancing server utilization and reducing response time. A hybrid proof approach combining worst-case and stochastic techniques is used, alongside simulations with a practical variant of SEK-SMOD.

Result: SEK-SMOD achieves lower mean response time than SRPT-k universally across different load levels and distributions, validated both theoretically and via simulations.

Conclusion: SEK-SMOD represents a significant improvement over SRPT-k, proving the potential of modified prioritization strategies in multiserver queue policies.

Abstract: A well-designed scheduling policy can unlock significant performance
improvements with no additional resources. Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known
to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic
limit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$
queue in any regime.
  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD),
which is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than
SRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size
distributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over
small jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby
improve the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a
novel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative
analysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away
from the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy. Furthermore, we design Practical-SEK (a
simplified variant of SEK-SMOD) and empirically verify the improvement over
SRPT-$k$ via simulation.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid model combining Bernstein phase-type (BPH) and hyperexponential (HE) distributions that captures heavy-tailed behaviors more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed distributions are challenging to model due to slow tail decay, necessitating solutions balancing analytical tractability and adaptability.

Method: The hybrid model integrates BPH for non-tail regions and HE for tails, utilizing optimized initial parameters for better robustness and model validity.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance in capturing both body and tail of heavy-tailed distributions, with enhanced metrics such as mean and coefficient of variation.

Conclusion: The introduced hybrid model is a promising solution for modeling heavy-tailed distributions with practical utility in areas like queuing theory, offering significant improvements over traditional BPH and HE models.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications
such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language
processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay.
Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability
and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution,
but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors
exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the
contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions,
hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution.
Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection,
significantly affecting their precision.
  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE
distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced
approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial
parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and
reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE
model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is
more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More
precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed
distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as
mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments
utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and
precision of our hybrid approach.

Result: Introduces a compositional method for implementing worst-case optimal joins using bounded work, leveraging miniKanren's fairness concept.

Conclusion: The fairness principle of miniKanren can lead to efficient and elegant methods for query processing in functional programming contexts.

Abstract: miniKanren's key semantic advance over Prolog is to implement a complete yet

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate2Create (D2C), a framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) to co-design robot morphology and control through iterative debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimizing robot morphology and control due to the vast design space and strong interdependence between body and behavior.

Method: Structured dialectical debates between LLM agents: a design agent suggests morphological changes, a control agent devises reward functions, and pluralistic judges provide feedback in simulations to refine designs iteratively.

Result: Through D2C, robot designs exhibited a 73% improvement in distance traveled compared to the default in quadruped locomotion benchmarks and showcased diverse specialized morphologies.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent debate paired with physics-grounded feedback is a promising approach for automated robot design, enabling effective and emergent co-design solutions.

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

### [288] [Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25913)
*Gilbert Bahati,Ryan M. Bena,Meg Wilkinson,Pol Mestres,Ryan K. Cosner,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper aims to develop risk-aware safety filters for robotic navigation utilizing mathematical constructs including Poisson’s and Laplace’s equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots navigating real-world environments need semantic understanding to safely avoid obstacles considering varying risk levels.

Method: Two steps: (1) Encode environment understanding via Poisson’s equation to create a safety function; (2) Address risk using Laplace guidance fields with tunable boundary conditions. These are combined to form a risk-aware safety filter.

Result: The proposed techniques were demonstrated in simulations, showcasing effective integration of risk-awareness into safety filters.

Conclusion: The study describes a novel method to incorporate semantic understanding and risk levels into robotic navigation systems, enabling a more dynamic and informed approach to obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

### [289] [Curvature-Aware Calibration of Tactile Sensors for Accurate Force Estimation on Non-Planar Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25965)
*Luoyan Zhong,Heather Jin Hee Kim,Dylan P. Losey,Cara M. Nunez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Developed a curvature-aware calibration model for resistive tactile sensors, improving their force estimation accuracy on curved surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of tactile sensors, which lose accuracy when mounted on curved or irregular surfaces.

Method: Designed a calibration model and trained a neural network (multilayer perceptron) to predict curvature from sensor baseline outputs.

Result: Validated the model on objects with varying curvatures under forces of 2 N to 8 N, achieving consistent accuracy across surfaces.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware calibration enhances the performance of tactile sensors for real-world applications, improving reliability and consistency.

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature
increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling
dependable performance across real-world applications.

### [290] [A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25985)
*Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves,Ryan M. Bena,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an axis-angle-based attitude control method that ensures unique equilibrium and stability for rigid body rotations, showcasing superior performance compared to traditional quaternion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quaternion-based attitude control methods face limitations, such as lack of unique equilibrium and reduced control effectiveness for large rotational errors.

Method: The authors developed a novel axis-angle-based attitude control law that ensures a unique closed-loop equilibrium attitude-error quaternion and uses Lyapunov functions to ensure uniform asymptotic stability.

Result: The proposed method outperformed a high-performance quaternion-based controller in stabilization time during flight tests and numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The axis-angle-based attitude control technique is more effective and reliable than the quaternion-based approach, particularly in terms of achieving stability and better control for rotational systems.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

*Bai Li,Achilleas Kourtellis,Rong Cao,Joseph Post,Brian Porter,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARTS, a drone-based AI system for real-time traffic incident detection, demonstrating high accuracy, adaptability, and potential for improved emergency response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional traffic incident detection methods that require dense infrastructure, offer limited flexibility, and separate detection from verification.

Method: Development of DARTS using drones for mobility, thermal imaging for visibility/privacy, and lightweight deep learning for real-time analysis. Field tests were conducted to validate its efficiency.

Result: DARTS achieved 99% detection accuracy on a custom dataset, verified incidents faster than traditional systems, and monitored congestion propagation efficiently during field tests.

Conclusion: DARTS offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for traffic incident detection, showcasing potential for better emergency response and traffic management in various settings.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cooperative swarm of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) equipped with Compton cameras to detect and track radioactive material in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and real-time localization of radioactive materials using lightweight and cooperative MAVs, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Method: Utilize lightweight (40g) single-detector Compton cameras on MAVs to fuse measurements and dynamically adjust vehicle movements through onboard data processing, ensuring maximum information gain in a cooperative swarm formation.

Result: The proposed system allows MAVs to rapidly localize and track even moving sources of ionizing radiation through sparse measurement data, achieving efficient radiation detection.

Conclusion: This innovative use of Compton cameras with MAVs offers a practical and highly sensitive solution for detecting and tracking radiation sources using cooperative and dynamic swarm behaviors.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

*Emily Steiner,Daniel van der Spuy,Futian Zhou,Afereti Pama,Minas Liarokapis,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel agent capable of learning to navigate tracks and overtake opponents effectively for autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of autonomous algorithms in safe, reliable overtaking in wheel-to-wheel racing scenarios, particularly emphasizing real-life driving challenges.

Method: Developing a novel racing and overtaking agent trained in both simulation and reality using the F1Tenth physical racing platform.

Result: The agent achieved an overtaking rate of 87% compared to 56% from a racing-only trained agent in competitive scenarios.

Conclusion: Training against opponents improves deliberate overtaking behaviors, demonstrating significant advancements in autonomous racing.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

*Chi Zhang,Mingrui Li,Wenzhe Tong,Xiaonan Huang*

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for tensegrity robots by integrating a Graph Neural Network with Soft Actor-Critic for faster and stable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensegrity robots face challenges in locomotion control due to their unique underactuated and highly coupled dynamics.

Method: The study employs Graph Neural Networks within a Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, using the robot's physical topology as a graph for improved learning and control.

Result: The framework achieves higher sample efficiency, noise and stiffness robustness, accurate trajectories, and successful simulation-to-hardware policy transfer without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning enhances tensegrity robot control, demonstrating resilient and deployable locomotion.

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

*Fan Yang,Renkai Ma,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Lingyao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines the emotional impact on children caused by the abrupt discontinuation of social robots and explores accountability across different stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of emotional distress in children caused by the sudden shutdown of social robots designed to build strong emotional connections.

Method: The authors conducted a qualitative survey with 72 U.S. participants using the Moxie shutdown case study to examine perspectives on accountability and continuation of services.

Result: Findings indicate shared responsibility among robot companies, parents, developers, and government, with variations based on political ideology and parental status. Participants held polarized views on service continuity.

Conclusion: The paper develops a shared responsibility framework to aid in designing policies and interventions that mitigate emotional harm caused by the discontinuation of child-robot interactions.

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

### [296] [Beyond the Uncanny Valley: A Mixed-Method Investigation of Anthropomorphism in Protective Responses to Robot Abuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26082)
*Fan Yang,Lingyao Li,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Renkai Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study examines how levels of anthropomorphism in robots influence protective responses to robot abuse, finding that uncanny and moderately anthropomorphic robots elicit stronger moral engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how varying levels of anthropomorphism in robots affect human moral and protective reactions towards robot abuse.

Method: An experiment was conducted with 201 participants observing abusive interactions with robots of differing anthropomorphism levels (low, moderate, high). Data was collected via self-report surveys, facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections.

Result: Moderate anthropomorphism triggered the strongest anger responses and moral concern, with moderately anthropomorphic robots rated as eeriest. Increased anthropomorphism shifted moral reasoning from property damage concerns to quasi-animal rights.

Conclusion: The uncanny valley increases moral concern rather than dampens it, influencing protective behaviors and highlighting the need for ethical considerations in robot design and regulation.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper explores embodied intelligence (EI) in robotic design, emphasizing co-design of physical structure and behavioral functionality for small-scale robots, highlighting examples like Bee++, RoBeetle, and others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To showcase embodied intelligence (EI) as a principle for enhancing microrobotics by merging body morphology, materials, environment interaction, and control strategies.

Method: The paper employs a co-design approach, integrating physical structure and behavioral functions in microrobotic systems developed at the Autonomous Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL).

Result: The robots presented (such as Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug) demonstrate intelligent behaviors naturally emerging from their structural dynamics and environmental interactions.

Conclusion: Co-design not only enables optimization under constraints but also promotes embodied intelligence, offering a scalable and robust alternative to traditional control in small-scale robotics.

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a kinodynamic Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) framework that improves planning efficiency and success rates by using a hybrid state tree, motion planners, physics simulators, and visual-language model (VLM) guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TAMP methods struggle with long-horizon problems due to excessive motion sampling, and while LLMs provide commonsense priors, they fail in 3D spatial reasoning and ensuring feasibility. This issue demands a unified framework balancing symbolic and motion planning.

Method: The authors propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state tree to jointly integrate symbolic and numeric state representations. Constraints are verified via motion planners and physics simulators, while VLM provides guidance by visual rendering to enhance decision-making.

Result: The proposed TAMP framework achieved significant improvements, with average success rates increased by 32.14% to 1166.67% compared to traditional and LLM-based planners, alongside reduced planning time in challenging problems.

Conclusion: Integrating kinodynamic constraints, motion feasibility checks, and VLM guidance offers a promising approach for solving long-horizon TAMP problems more effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm for mobile robots in cluttered environments, tackling narrow passage challenges effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods often fail or produce suboptimal paths for mobile robots in cluttered environments, particularly narrow passages.

Method: The algorithm involves segment-wise conservative collision tests for path-level safety and pose correction using penetration direction and line search for pose-level safety.

Result: Simulation results show up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x faster planning times compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments validate its effectiveness in navigating narrow passages safely and quickly.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm significantly improves safety and efficiency in trajectory planning for mobile robots in complex environments.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-localization method combining CNN and Vision Transformers, achieving better accuracy in environments with dynamic obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve self-localization accuracy in autonomous driving using low-cost monocular cameras, especially in challenging environments with dynamic obstacles.

Method: The study integrates CNNs (for local feature extraction) and Vision Transformers (for global feature extraction) to address the limitations of CNNs in handling dynamic obstacles.

Result: Compared to SOTA methods, the proposed approach improves accuracy by a 1.5x rate in CG datasets with dynamic obstacles and achieves 20.1% smaller localization errors on public datasets. It demonstrates a 7.51cm average localization error with a robot.

Conclusion: The hybrid method combining CNNs and Vision Transformers enhances self-localization for autonomous driving, particularly outperforming others in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PHUMA introduces a scalable and physically reliable humanoid locomotion dataset leveraging human video data, improving upon limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion imitation methods rely on rare, expensive motion capture datasets or large internet videos, which can introduce physical artifacts affecting reliability.

Method: PHUMA addresses limitations by curating a dataset from large-scale human video, applying physics-constrained retargeting to remove artifacts like floating and foot skating.

Result: PHUMA outperformed other datasets like Humanoid-X and AMASS in imitating diverse unseen motions and following paths guided by pelvis movements.

Conclusion: PHUMA provides a scalable and physically-grounded approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling enhanced imitation of motions with improved physical realism.

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

*Gangyang Li,Qing Shi,Youhao Hu,Jincheng Hu,Zhongyuan Wang,Xinlong Wang,Shaqi Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: "Thor" is a humanoid framework designed for human-like adaptive whole-body reactions in environments requiring intense force interactions. It uses a unique force-adaptive reward function and a decoupled reinforcement learning control architecture. Tested on the Unitree G1 robot, Thor shows significant improvements in strength and capability for contact-rich tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of enabling humanoids to exhibit stable, human-like, and adaptive full-body reactions during intense contact-driven interactions.

Method: Thor utilizes a force-adaptive torso-tilt reward function for human-like reactions and implements a decoupled reinforcement learning architecture, dividing control among the upper body, waist, and lower body. Parameters are jointly updated using shared whole-body global observations.

Result: Thor demonstrated a 68.9% improvement in backward pulling force (167.7 N) and a 74.7% improvement in forward pulling force (145.5 N) compared to baselines. It successfully performed tasks such as pulling a loaded rack (130 N) and opening a fire door (60 N).

Conclusion: Thor proves effective at enhancing humanoid robots' capabilities in force-interaction tasks, achieving superior performance over existing baselines and contributing to advancing real-world applications in industrial, service, and rescue scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

*Mirko Usuelli,David Rapado-Rincon,Gert Kootstra,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM is a real-time Visual-LiDAR SLAM framework for robust 3D scene understanding in orchards. It achieves sharper, stable reconstructions while addressing seasonal and environmental challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges autonomous robots face in orchards, such as dealing with seasonal appearance changes, repetitive row geometry, and foliage motion.

Method: The study introduces AgriGS-SLAM, a system combining LiDAR odometry with 3D Gaussian Splatting. It uses batch rasterization for occlusion recovery and a gradient-driven map lifecycle to preserve details.

Result: AgriGS-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in stability, reconstruction quality, and trajectory smoothness across different orchard conditions with real-time capability.

Conclusion: AgriGS-SLAM enhances orchard monitoring and can be applied to other outdoor domains needing robust multimodal perception.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

*Tobias Löw,Cem Bilaloglu,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper derives theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces in multi-arm robotic systems using conformal geometric algebra, enabling seamless integration into control techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of coordinating movements in complex multi-arm robotic systems with high degrees of freedom for tasks requiring collaboration.

Method: Develop a framework using geometric primitives and conformal geometric algebra to represent multi-arm systems analogous to single-arm systems, enabling controller design through Jacobian matrices.

Result: Demonstrated the approach in control experiments with bimanual manipulators, humanoids, and multi-fingered hands for achieving geometric primitives and exploring teleoperation.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates effective control of multi-arm robotic systems and introduces nullspace structures for secondary objectives, showcasing potential future applications.

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

*Ilya Kurinov,Miroslav Ivanov,Grzegorz Orzechowski,Aki Mikkola*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Research aims to automate forestry forwarder operations using reinforcement learning, achieving a 94% success in log handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operators face physical and mental exhaustion during prolonged forestry forwarder operations, creating a need for automation.

Method: Develop a simulated forestry forwarder model using NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and train reinforcement learning agents with curriculum learning for log handling.

Result: Agent achieved 94% success rate in grasping logs from random positions and transporting them to the forwarder bed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a promising step towards automating forestry forwarder operations using reinforcement learning agents.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

*Guanxing Lu,Rui Zhao,Haitao Lin,He Zhang,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hi-ORS, a rejection sampling-based method for robust online fine-tuning, improving reinforcement and imitation learning for robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with instability and sparse supervision in online fine-tuning, while imitation learning (IL), though stable, underperforms due to its offline nature. The authors aim to address these limitations to develop robust robotic manipulation policies.

Method: Hi-ORS leverages rejection sampling to stabilize value estimation by filtering negatively rewarded samples and uses reward-weighted supervised training for intermediate-step supervision. It also incorporates human-in-the-loop corrections within an asynchronous inference-training framework.

Result: Hi-ORS achieved effective fine-tuning for robotic manipulation tasks, significantly outperforming RL and IL baselines in efficiency and effectiveness. The method was tested in three real-world tasks and demonstrated scalable error-recovery behavior.

Conclusion: Hi-ORS offers a promising approach to stabilize and enhance robotic policy learning, combining the advantages of RL and IL while addressing their key limitations effectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboOS-NeXT, a unified framework for improving lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration by proposing a novel memory representation called Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems face limitations in adaptability, coordination, scheduling, and memory constraints, hindering their performance over long horizons and in heterogeneous teams.

Method: RoboOS-NeXT employs a unified memory-based design integrating STEM, a brain-cerebellum framework that balances global planning and local execution through memory-centric collaboration.

Result: Experiments in coordination tasks like restaurants, supermarkets, and households show RoboOS-NeXT's effectiveness in scalability, fault tolerance, and heterogeneous robot collaboration.

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT successfully addresses existing challenges in multi-robot systems and provides a robust and scalable solution for lifelong collaboration using its unique memory-centric framework.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework enhancing robots' ability to use tools by expanding their kinematics understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots have limited kinematic understanding and struggle to effectively use tools.

Method: Developed an advanced inverse kinematics solver and leverage simulation-learned action trajectories for skill transfer to real-world tasks.

Result: Extended inverse kinematics solver achieved less than 1 cm error and the trained policy showed 8 cm mean error in simulation regardless of tool length.

Conclusion: The approach enables robots to improve tool manipulation skills across diverse tasks with high precision and adaptability.

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

*Gang Li,Chunlei Zhai,Teng Wang,Shaun Li,Shangsong Jiang,Xiangwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLYINGTRUST, a benchmarking framework for high-fidelity evaluation of visual navigation algorithms in quadrotors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in transferring visual navigation algorithms across different quadrotor platforms and scene geometries, aiming to reduce deployment costs and risks.

Method: FLYINGTRUST provides compact indicators of vehicle capability, a diverse scenario library, and standardized evaluation protocols with composite scoring to assess navigation robustness.

Result: The results highlight that navigation success is influenced by platform capability and scene geometry, with distinct performance patterns for different algorithms.

Conclusion: Incorporating both platform capability and scenario structure is essential for robust algorithm design and motivates further research in methods that work across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a sliding-window filter (SWF) method for continuous-time state estimation in continuum robots (CRs), achieving improved accuracy and faster-than-real-time operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stochastic estimation methods for continuum robots struggle between accuracy and efficiency, with existing techniques either relying on simplified approaches or being constrained by the runtime limits of measurement speeds.

Method: The paper develops a sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation, enabling online operation and enhancing accuracy through improved stochastic representation.

Result: The proposed SWF achieves accurate state estimation for continuum robots while operating faster than real-time, blending the advantages of filters and continuous-time methods.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel stochastic SWF tailored for continuum robots, addressing key limitations of existing approaches and laying the foundation for further research in more efficient state estimation methods.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical framework combining DQN for sub-goal selection and TD3 for motion control, showcasing improved path-planning performances in dynamic environments using ROS and Gazebo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve path-planning capabilities by combining high-level sub-goal selection with low-level continuous control to enhance efficiency and safety in dynamic and partially observable environments.

Method: A hierarchical system with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for sub-goal choices and a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller for actuation, complemented by reward shaping and a LiDAR-based safety mechanism.

Result: Experiments demonstrated increased success and sample efficiency over standalone algorithms and rule-based planners, with better adaptation to new obstacle configurations and smoother control performance.

Conclusion: The integrated DQN and TD3 framework effectively enhances path-planning in dynamic settings, achieving better outcome metrics and generalization compared to existing approaches, with available code for use and benchmarking.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

### [313] [Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656)
*Georgios Kamaras,Craig Innes,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces three heuristic variants (EDGE, MODE, CENTRE) to improve likelihood-free inference (LFI) in robotics by addressing support misspecification, enhancing robustness and precision in applications like deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve LFI methods for adapting learned agents to deployment conditions. LFI suffers from potential support misspecifications, resulting in suboptimal inference and performance.

Method: It proposes heuristic LFI variants (EDGE, MODE, CENTRE) that adapt the support dynamically alongside posterior inference by interpreting posterior mode shifts.

Result: The proposed heuristics address support misspecification issues and improve parameter inference and policy learning for DLO manipulation, enhancing accuracy in length and stiffness classification and robustness in agent performance.

Conclusion: Adapting the support dynamically during inference using heuristic methods improves the precision of domain distributions and robustness of agent performance in robotics applications.

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP) to improve visuomotor policy learning by combining stochastic and one-step processes for faster and diverse behavior generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based imitation learning methods for visuomotor policies struggle with balancing fast sampling and capturing diverse behaviors effectively.

Method: HCP employs a short stochastic prefix followed by a one-step consistency jump, aligned through time-varying consistency distillation, combining trajectory-consistency and denoising-matching objectives.

Result: Simulation and robotic experiments demonstrate that HCP with fewer steps significantly reduces latency while maintaining accuracy and mode coverage comparable to slower models.

Conclusion: HCP achieves efficient visuomotor policy learning with strong multi-modality and faster inference, offering a practical trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for robot applications.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Motivation: To make large VLA models suitable for dynamic real-time tasks that were previously impossible.

Method: Introducing strategies to reduce inference overhead, allowing high-frequency VLA operations.

Result: The approach achieves 100% success in a real-world task of grasping a falling pen using the pi0 policy.

Conclusion: A full streaming inference framework is proposed for real-time robotics control using VLA.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success
rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a

*Wenhao Yang,Minghui Zhou,Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar,Yehui Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An analytical framework for holistic risk governance in open source enterprise engagement, transitioning from reactive to proactive practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of traditional technical-focused risk management in mitigating complex systemic risks associated with open source involvement by enterprises.

Method: Conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a risk governance framework based on the relationship between external threats and internal vulnerabilities, operationalized through a logical decision chain model (OTVM).

Result: Developed a holistic framework consisting of a Strategic Objectives Matrix, taxonomy of external threats and internal vulnerabilities, and a mitigation model. Validated through case studies with industry experts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables enterprises to shift from reactive risk management to proactive governance by addressing both technical and organizational vulnerabilities and aligning risk mitigation with enterprise objectives.

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

### [319] [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the environmental impact of GitHub Actions in CI/CD pipelines, revealing substantial carbon and water footprints while suggesting strategies to mitigate these impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of awareness among developers about the environmental impact of CI/CD pipelines and cloud computing, particularly carbon and water footprints, which are generally undisclosed by service providers.

Method: The study assesses the environmental impact of GitHub Actions through a methodology adapted from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework, analyzing over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000 repositories.

Result: The GitHub Actions ecosystem causes significant environmental impacts, with carbon footprints in 2024 projected to range from 150.5 to 994.9 MTCO2e, and water footprints between 1,989.6 and 37,664.5 kiloliters, depending on scenarios.

Conclusion: Developers can mitigate CI/CD environmental impacts by optimizing computational resource usage, deploying runners in low-impact energy production regions, stricter deactivation policies, aligning scheduling with eco-friendly energy periods, and minimizing repository sizes.

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

*Musfiqur Rahman,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models' (LLMs) performance in generating real-world class-level implementations and finds significant gaps compared to synthetic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand limitations and improve large language models' ability to generate correct class-level code in authentic software projects, addressing real-world programming scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced a benchmark derived from open-source repositories, categorizing real-world software classes into seen and unseen groups, while testing LLMs under varied specifications, retrieval-augmented settings, and documentation completeness.

Result: LLMs perform well on synthetic benchmarks (84%-89% correctness) but poorly on real-world class tasks (25%-34% correctness). Retrieval augmentation with partial documentation improved correctness slightly (4%-7%).

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit critical shortcomings in class-level code generation, highlighting areas for improvement in context modeling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration for better production code tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

### [321] [Reduction of Test Re-runs by Prioritizing Potential Order Dependent Flaky Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26171)
*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of unreliable flaky tests, particularly order-dependent tests, proposing a prioritization method to enhance detection efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests, especially order-dependent ones, disrupt automated testing by causing unpredictability and failed CI pipelines, despite not indicating faults.

Method: The presented method analyzes shared static fields in test classes to prioritize tests likely to be order-dependent, reducing unnecessary re-runs.

Result: In experiments on 27 modules, the prioritization method reduced test executions by 65.92% and re-runs by 72.19%, successfully prioritizing OD tests in 23 out of 27 cases.

Conclusion: The approach improves the efficiency of detecting order-dependent tests, significantly lowering execution costs and enhancing testing reliability.

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

*Mihály Dobos-Kovács,Levente Bajczi,András Vörös*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHCVERIF, a tool that uses software verification techniques to solve Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs), particularly excelling in bitvector tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the solving of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs), a critical representation in verification tasks, by leveraging existing well-established software verification tools.

Method: The authors develop CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that integrates software verification tools to solve CHC benchmarks, especially those involving bitvectors and low-level semantics.

Result: CHCVERIF demonstrates moderate success with linear integer arithmetic but performs notably well on bitvector benchmarks, proving the feasibility of reusing software verification techniques for CHC solving.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential and effectiveness of integrating software verification tools into CHC solvers, particularly for tasks involving bitvectors, fostering innovation in verification methods.

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

*Liming Dong,Sung Une Lee,Zhenchang Xing,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Stefan Avgoustakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the critical risks posed by software supply chain attacks, especially on critical infrastructure sectors, and provides a structured checklist to evaluate and enhance security measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The threat of software supply chain attacks is rapidly increasing, posing risks to national security, economic stability, and public safety, and current security practices are inadequate and fragmented.

Method: The authors conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks, regulatory sources, and academic studies, applying a "4W+1H" analytical approach to identify security practices and create a structured checklist.

Result: They synthesized ten core categories of software supply chain security practices, mapped these across life-cycle phases, stakeholder roles, implementation levels, and framework coverage, identifying gaps with sector-specific needs.

Conclusion: The paper provides a multi-layered checklist to help stakeholders safeguard critical infrastructure and calls for integrated, context-aware approaches to address evolving security risks.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

TL;DR: This paper creates a GenAI-augmented SE roadmap, analyzing its effects on software engineering (SE) processes, tools, and framing future research, culminating in 10 predictions for SE by 2030.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Generative AI (GenAI) transforms software engineering (SE) processes, methods, and systems, and to provide a roadmap for its integration and future research.

Method: The study follows a design science research approach involving three cycles: collaborative discussions, literature reviews, and external peer feedback, combined with McLuhan's tetrads to systematically evaluate GenAI's impact on SE.

Result: The study identifies four fundamental types of GenAI augmentations in SE and highlights related research challenges and opportunities, consolidated in a roadmap with future research directions.

Conclusion: The research provides a framework for understanding GenAI's transformative effects on SE, guiding future research and offering insights through ten predictions for SE by 2030.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RepoSearch-R1, a reinforcement learning framework using Monte-Carlo Tree Search for efficient reasoning in repository-level software engineering tasks, resulting in significant performance and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to address the limitations of existing large language model (LLM) approaches, which struggle with guiding agents in repository tasks due to inefficiencies in tool usage, high costs of training via model distillation, and issues with data compliance in enterprise settings.

Method: The authors propose RepoSearch-R1, an agentic reinforcement learning framework integrating Monte-Carlo Tree Search to enable self-training and diverse reasoning trajectories, without relying on model distillation or external supervision.

Result: The RepoSearch-R1 framework demonstrated a 16% improvement in answer completeness over no-retrieval methods, a 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and a 33% increase in training efficiency compared to other agentic reinforcement learning techniques on repository question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: RepoSearch-R1 effectively overcomes data compliance issues in enterprise environments and improves exploration diversity and answer completeness, making it a highly efficient method for repository-level reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

*Dong Huang,Mingzhe Du,Jie M. Zhang,Zheng Lin,Meng Luo,Qianru Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nexus, a multi-agent framework for generating test oracles more accurately in non-regression testing. Nexus uses deliberation, validation, and self-refinement to improve oracle performance and bug detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge in software engineering of creating accurate test oracles for non-regression testing.

Method: Nexus employs specialized agents collaborating through a structured process of deliberation, validation in a sandbox environment, and iterative refinement based on runtime errors.

Result: Nexus achieved substantial improvements, with oracle accuracy on benchmarks increasing and causing better bug detection rates and success rates in automated program repair.

Conclusion: Nexus outperforms existing baselines by consistently improving oracle accuracy and enhancing downstream tasks, validating its utility in software testing.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

*Fang Liu,Simiao Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Xiaoli Lian,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents SecureReviewer, a method to improve large language models (LLMs) for detecting and addressing security issues during code review, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited effectiveness of existing automated code review models in detecting security issues, scarcity of specialized datasets, and inadequate evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors constructed a security-focused dataset, fine-tuned LLMs using a secure-aware strategy, integrated the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to ground outputs in security knowledge, and developed a new evaluation metric, SecureBLEU, to measure security issue addressing effectiveness.

Result: SecureReviewer achieved superior performance compared to existing baselines in detecting security issues and generating practical, high-quality review comments.

Conclusion: SecureReviewer provides a robust approach for enhancing LLMs to identify and resolve security-related issues during code review, addressing limitations in current methods and improving security issue detection and review comment quality.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

*Sivajeet Chand,Melih Kilic,Roland Würsching,Sushant Kumar Pandey,Alexander Pretschner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of five open-source large language models (LLMs) on automating Extract Method refactoring (EMR) for Python code, exploring functional correctness, code quality, and the impact of prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of automating the process of Extract Method refactoring, which remains largely manual despite being crucial for improving code readability and maintainability.

Method: The authors used five open-source LLMs ranging from 3B to 8B parameters and assessed their performance in EMR tasks using one-shot prompting and a novel Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) prompting strategy. They performed evaluations of functional correctness, code quality, test pass rates, and conducted a developer survey.

Result: RCI-based prompting consistently outperformed one-shot prompting, achieving high test pass rates and improved code refactoring metrics like reduced cyclomatic complexity (CC) and lines of code (LOC). Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI emerged as best performers with notable improvements in coding metrics and over 70% developer-acceptance of their outputs.

Conclusion: Automated refactoring guided by quality prompting strategies like RCI significantly improves the readability and maintainability of code compared to original implementations. While traditional metrics provide some insights, human-in-the-loop evaluations are crucial for refining such methods. The open-source benchmark provides a basis for further research in automated code refactoring.

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual and time-consuming nature of iterative web code modification motivates the need for improving automated web editing capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The study proposes Instruct4Edit, an automated pipeline to generate fine-tuning datasets by synthesizing instructions, applying code modifications, and verifying visually for correctness.

Result: Fine-tuning models on the Instruct4Edit dataset consistently improves performance in aligning web code modifications with human intentions and achieving visually accurate web edits.

Conclusion: This work offers scalable and transparent solutions to improve natural language-based web editing, showing open-source models can rival proprietary systems in performance. Authors release all resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

Result: The paper showcases ZKMLOps through a study on financial risk auditing regulations and evaluates ZKP protocols, determining their feasibility and analyzing performance trade-offs for varying ML model complexity.

Conclusion: ZKMLOps provides a systematic approach to balance transparency, trustworthiness, and proprietary protection in AI systems within regulated environments.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

### [332] [Online and Interactive Bayesian Inference Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26579)
*Nathanael Nussbaumer,Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Probabilistic programming helps automate Bayesian inference but is challenging for debugging. This paper introduces a novel tool to simplify and streamline the debugging of Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic programming makes Bayesian techniques accessible, but its debugging is complex, requiring significant expertise and time.

Method: The authors propose and introduce a debugging framework integrated into the development environment, designed to reduce time and expertise needed for Bayesian inference debugging.

Result: The method was evaluated with 18 experienced participants, demonstrating significant improvements in time and ease of debugging Bayesian inference.

Conclusion: The developed tool provides an effective solution for simplifying and accelerating the debugging of Bayesian inference, addressing the inherent challenges of probabilistic programming.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

### [333] [Stitch: Step-by-step LLM Guided Tutoring for Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26634)
*Yuan Si,Kyle Qi,Daming Li,Hanyuan Shi,Jialu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stitch, a tutoring system for debugging in block-based programming, emphasizing step-by-step scaffolding rather than showing correct answers directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novices struggle with semantic bugs in block-based programming, and existing debugging methods fail to foster problem-solving skills effectively.

Method: Stitch uses Diff-Analyze module to identify and explain key differences between a student's and reference implementation using a large language model, helping learners iteratively resolve bugs with partial fixes.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Stitch enhances learning outcomes compared to automated feedback tools by fostering effective debugging practices.

Conclusion: Step-by-step tutoring, as implemented in Stitch, is superior to direct-answer methods, promoting better problem-solving skills in block-based programming environments.

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

### [334] [Process-based Indicators of Vulnerability Re-Introducing Code Changes: An Exploratory Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26676)
*Samiha Shimmi,Nicholas M. Synovic,Mona Rahimi,George K. Thiruvathukal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the recurring issue of software vulnerabilities, emphasizing that their re-emergence stems from complex socio-technical factors and cumulative development activities. It proposes incorporating process metrics alongside code metrics to better predict and mitigate vulnerability reintroduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore if and how process metrics can help identify risky development behaviors that contribute to the persistence or re-introduction of software vulnerabilities, which are influenced by complex interactions between code and socio-technical factors.

Method: The authors analyzed vulnerability reintroduction at the commit level rather than just the file level. They conducted a case study on the ImageMagick project, correlating longitudinal process metrics like bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities.

Result: The study found that reintroduction of vulnerabilities is associated with factors such as increased issue spoilage and fluctuating issue density, indicating inefficiencies in issue management and team responses during these periods.

Conclusion: The research underscores that vulnerability reintroduction is not caused by isolated events but by cumulative socio-technical conditions and development activities. It highlights the need for integrating process and code metrics to anticipate and avoid risky code changes, ultimately enhancing software security.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

### [335] [Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26699)
*Aylton Almeida,Laerte Xavier,Marco Tulio Valente*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capability of an LLM-powered autonomous coding system to automate the migration of SQLAlchemy versions across client applications, achieving high migration coverage but a low functionality test-pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating libraries and frameworks is important to mitigate risks like technical debt and security vulnerabilities but is often a time-consuming and error-prone process.

Method: The study employed Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI system, to conduct multi-step migration workflows of the SQLAlchemy library in ten client applications. A new metric, Migration Coverage, was introduced to measure effectiveness.

Result: The AI system achieved a perfect migration coverage (100%, median) but yielded a low application functionality test-pass rate (39.75%, median).

Conclusion: While LLM-based automation has promise in simplifying migrations, it struggles with maintaining complete application functionality, highlighting the need for further improvement in automated coding systems.

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

*Nafid Enan,Gias Uddin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates log parsers to convert semi-structured log data into structured data, comparing syntax- and semantic-based techniques along with single-phase and two-phase architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Log parsing is critical for automated log analysis, aiding software runtime and maintenance. Evaluating various log parsers helps identify strengths and weaknesses of different methods.

Method: A comprehensive empirical study is conducted comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers and evaluating single-phase vs. two-phase architectures. Experiments provide insight into accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Semantic methods excel in template identification, whereas syntax-based methods are 10-1,000 times faster and more accurate in grouping. Two-phase architecture improves accuracy compared to single-phase.

Conclusion: The proposed SynLog+ enhances parsing accuracy for syntax-based parsers (236%) and semantic-based parsers (20%) without additional runtime cost, addressing weaknesses of existing methods.

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

### [337] [InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943)
*Ann Huang,Mitchell Ostrow,Satpreet H. Singh,Leo Kozachkov,Ila Fiete,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces InputDSA, an advanced metric to compare intrinsic and input-driven dynamics, crucial for analyzing real-world systems. It improves upon the DSA framework by incorporating external input impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation in the DSA framework where external input impacts are not considered, a limitation that misrepresents similarities in input-driven systems.

Method: The proposed InputDSA uses a modified Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) for estimating intrinsic and input-driven dynamic operators, allowing comparisons under noisy and partially observed conditions.

Result: InputDSA successfully compares systems using noisy data, identifies dynamical similarities in high-performing RNNs, and tracks transitions between input-driven and intrinsically-driven processes in rat neural data.

Conclusion: InputDSA proves to be a robust and efficient tool for analyzing the interaction of intrinsic and external dynamics in complex systems, bridging gaps in current modeling methodologies.

Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare
observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural
systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and
deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical
Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems
based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However,
DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar
systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because
real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account
for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for
comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA
(iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both
input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We
demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed,
input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are
unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in
similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing
networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks
are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats
performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from
input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our
work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing
intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

### [338] [Integrated Information Theory: A Consciousness-First Approach to What Exists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25998)
*Giulio Tononi,Melanie Boly*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper discusses Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which defines existence based on the consciousness-first approach, linking the properties of consciousness to physical existence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a comprehensive framework to explain consciousness and its essential properties using a unique consciousness-first ontology.

Method: The authors propose that for an entity to exist, it must demonstrate intrinsic cause-effect power in a specific way—unitary, definite, and structured. IIT is used to operationally derive these properties.

Result: IIT explains how the cause-effect structure of an entity corresponds to every aspect of conscious experience, including spatial, temporal, and sensory dynamics. It also extends to broad applications in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: IIT offers a framework to link consciousness with physical structure, providing implications for evaluating consciousness across different species, human states, artificial systems, and reshaping our understanding of existence and free will.

Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's
"consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to
each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential
properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties
operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist
intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon
itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's
explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts
for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no
additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness,
temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular
configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's
intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and
free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and
artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conformal prediction framework for accurate uncertainty quantification in infinite-horizon reinforcement learning, improving prediction reliability in on-policy and off-policy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable uncertainty quantification is essential for reinforcement learning applications in high-stakes scenarios to ensure safety and robustness.

Method: The paper utilizes distributional RL combined with conformal calibration, proposing innovations like modular pseudo-return construction and time-aware calibration using experience replay and weighted subsampling.

Result: The method demonstrated improved coverage and reliability in prediction intervals compared to traditional distributional RL baselines, validated in synthetic and benchmark environments like Mountain Car.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses challenges of unobserved returns, temporal dependencies, and policy shifts, ensuring reliable RL uncertainty quantification with theoretical coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning
(RL) in high-stakes settings. We propose a unified conformal prediction
framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs
distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and
off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal
calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal
dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return
construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy
using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate
model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty
quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides
coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance
weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and
benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly
improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model to improve classification performance and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where indefinite kernels are more effective than positive definite ones while enhancing model interpretability and generalization.

Method: The paper introduces an $L_1$-norm penalty in indefinite kernel logistic regression and develops a proximal linearized algorithm to optimize the model.

Result: Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show improved classification accuracy and enhanced sparsity.

Conclusion: The RIKLR model demonstrates superior performance in classification tasks and achieves sparsity, making it interpretable and generalizable.

Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely
applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite
kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive
definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite
kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR
framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction
of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while
introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To
address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally
efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.

*Pengfei Lyu,Zhengchi Ma,Linjun Zhang,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bias correction procedure to address the issues caused by synthetic data in imbalanced classification problems, improving prediction accuracy and reducing overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of classification on imbalanced datasets, where synthetic data generation often fails to replicate original data distributions, causing prediction inaccuracies.

Method: The authors propose a bias correction procedure that uses information from the majority group to correct for biases introduced by synthetic data. They extend this method to broader scenarios like imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are provided for bias estimation error bounds and prediction accuracy improvements. Empirical validation through simulations and data analysis on handwritten digit datasets shows the method’s effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed bias correction procedure mitigates the negative effects of synthetic data on prediction accuracy, offers consistent bias estimators, and can be applied in various imbalanced data contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Tomoharu Iwata,Futoshi Futami*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph neural network-based framework to solve quadratic programming (QP) problems efficiently by reducing dimensions using instance-specific projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods require significant computation time for high-dimensional QPs, necessitating efficient and adaptable approaches.

Method: They train a graph neural network model in a bilevel optimization setup, which optimizes projections specific to each QP instance without full backpropagation through the solver.

Result: The framework yields high-quality feasible QP solutions with reduced computation times and outperforms existing techniques in experiments.

Conclusion: Instance-specific projections powered by neural networks offer an effective and computationally efficient approach to solving heterogeneous QP problems.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic
programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in
high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural
network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP
instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously
unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the
expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is
formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the
QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization
updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this
bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without
backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by
neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces
high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming
existing methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel metric called Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score to address ambiguity in model quality assessment in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the ambiguity and challenges caused by the multi-objective nature of physics-informed machine learning, particularly related to epistemic uncertainty and failure of conventional statistical metrics.

Method: The authors use Gaussian process regression to develop the PILE score, an uncertainty-aware metric for selecting PIML model hyperparameters, and show its applications in optimizing various model parameters.

Result: The PILE score showcases its effectiveness in selecting optimal kernel bandwidths, regularization weights, kernel functions, and identifying kernel choices for PDEs even without data acquisition.

Conclusion: The PILE score provides a robust metric for hyperparameter tuning in PIML models and shows significant potential to be generalized across PIML approaches in the future.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical
information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the
process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML
approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks,
neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are
typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical
constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates
ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor
understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure
modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working
within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the
Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test
losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a
selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE
minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters,
including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even
kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a
special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices
that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we
anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline
approaches to do so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-output Gaussian process regressions face challenges of sensitivity to model misspecifications and outliers, particularly when errors propagate due to correlations between multiple response variables.

Method: The study extends the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) framework into a multi-output setting, called MO-RCGP, ensuring robustness and capturing output correlations jointly.

Result: The MO-RCGP approach demonstrates robust performance in handling outliers and model misspecifications through applications in diverse domains such as finance and cancer research.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the MO-RCGP method effectively improves the robustness of MOGP models while maintaining conjugacy and addressing output dependency challenges.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies
among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian
processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which
can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be
further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors
propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we
extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP)
framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the
multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and
jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach through applications in finance and cancer research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the perspectives of reinforcement learning and stochastic processes and explore their application in modeling complex systems like spiking neural networks.

Method: The authors propose action-driven processes and leverage the control-as-inference framework, using the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to achieve equivalence with maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Result: Action-driven processes unify the modeling of stochastic processes and reinforcement learning, demonstrating their applicability to spiking neural networks.

Conclusion: This unification provides an innovative perspective for studying complex systems through the integration of stochastic processes and reinforcement learning paradigms.

Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in
response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in
the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state
transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.
In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and
reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their
application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from
control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model
distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to
maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the need to assess the reliability of causal machine learning models for predicting individualized treatment effects, particularly considering violations of the conditional exchangeability assumption.

Method: The authors conducted simulation studies using causal forest and X-learner models. They evaluated performance under varying confounding levels, sample sizes, and unmeasured confounding structures, while also testing the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as diagnostics.

Result: Both causal forest and X-learner models struggled under violations of conditional exchangeability, failing to recover true treatment effect heterogeneity and sometimes showing heterogeneity where none existed. NCOs were able to identify subgroups with unmeasured confounding, though not always the most strongly affected.

Conclusion: Conditional exchangeability violations significantly challenge the validity of causal machine learning models in observational data. However, NCOs can act as practical tools for detecting biases, improving the robustness of ITE analyses when integrated into causal ML workflows.

Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.

### [348] [Bridging the Gap between Empirical Welfare Maximization and Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation in Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26723)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper examines two major approaches in policy learning for treatment recommendation, proves their equivalence, and proposes an efficient regularization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between empirical welfare maximization (EWM) and the plug-in approach, making policy learning more efficient and theoretically unified.

Method: The study analytically proves equivalence between EWM and least squares via policy class reparameterization and introduces a novel regularization method.

Result: The equivalence demonstrates that EWM and plug-in approaches are interchangeable and share theoretical guarantees under shared conditions. Regularization enhances computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings unify two policy learning paradigms, providing computational efficiency and theoretical reliability in decision-making processes.

Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.

### [349] [A Unified Theory for Causal Inference: Direct Debiased Machine Learning via Bregman-Riesz Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26783)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified theory for causal inference, linking multiple estimation methods used in average treatment effect (ATE) estimation such as Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation, and TMLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To consolidate and unify existing methods for causal inference in ATE estimation, enabling a clearer understanding of their inter-relations and mechanisms.

Method: It aligns key concepts in ATE estimation like balancing weights and regression functions, connecting methods such as Riesz regression with density-ratio estimation and covariate balancing.

Result: A unified perspective is established, showing relationships like equivalency between Riesz regression and DRE in ATE, and linking matching estimator with other methods.

Conclusion: This unified framework provides clarity in how various causal inference methods are connected, improving the theoretical understanding for ATE estimation.

Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.

### [350] [Finding Regular Herbrand Models for CHCs using Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26428)
*Gregoire Maire,Thomas Genet*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to establish satisfiability for Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) over Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) using tree automata and SAT encoding with the Clingo tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of determining the satisfiability of CHCs over ADTs by exploring a novel approach involving tree automata and Answer Set Programming.

Method: The paper proposes translating CHCs with ADTs into SAT problems using Clingo, an ASP tool, and developing a tree automaton that recognizes the regular Herbrand model of CHCs.

Result: The proposed method combines ASP methodology with Clingo, providing a semi-complete satisfiability checker. It can find a tree automaton for a regular Herbrand model or identify counter-examples for unsatisfiable problems.

Conclusion: The method shows promise in verifying satisfiability of CHCs over ADTs by encoding them into SAT problems, yielding either tree automata or counter-examples, and demonstrates practical implementation possibilities.

Abstract: We are interested in proving satisfiability of Constrained Horn Clauses
(CHCs) over Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). We propose to prove satisfiability by
building a tree automaton recognizing the Herbrand model of the CHCs. If such
an automaton exists then the model is said to be regular, i.e., the Herbrand
model is a regular set of atoms. Kostyukov et al. have shown how to derive an
automaton when CVC4 finds a finite model of the CHCs. We propose an alternative
way to build the automaton using an encoding into a SAT problem using Clingo,
an Answer Set Programming (ASP) tool. We implemented a translation of CHCs with
ADTs into an ASP problem. Combined with Clingo, we obtain a semi-complete
satisfiability checker: it finds a tree automaton if a regular Herbrand model
exists or finds a counter-example if the problem is unsatisfiable.

### [351] [Semantic Properties of Computations Defined by Elementary Inference Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26429)
*Salvador Lucas*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper explores a framework for defining and analyzing sets, relations, and computations using Elementary Inference Systems (EIS) and their associated first-order theories (Th(I)).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to formalize the analysis of properties for computation and programming languages using canonical models and semantic properties derived from Elementary Inference Systems.

Method: The authors utilize the notion of canonical and arbitrary models for first-order theories (Horn clauses). They propose proving or disproving semantic properties (expressed as first-order sentences) by testing their satisfiability in arbitrary models instead of infeasible canonical models.

Result: The proposed approach offers a method to assess semantic properties of Elementary Inference Systems — even for complex computations, like those in rewriting-based systems — without requiring canonical models.

Conclusion: Canonical models are often incomputable, but they proposed a practical method by leveraging satisfiability in arbitrary models, making it applicable to programming languages and rewriting systems.

Abstract: We consider sets/relations/computations defined by *Elementary Inference
Systems* I, which are obtained from Smullyan's *elementary formal systems*
using Gentzen's notation for inference rules, and proof trees for atoms
P(t_1,...,t_n), where predicate P represents the considered
set/relation/computation. A first-order theory Th(I), actually a set of
definite Horn clauses, is given to I. Properties of objects defined by I are
expressed as first-order sentences F, which are proved true or false by
*satisfaction* M |= F of F in a *canonical* model M of Th(I). For this reason,
we call F a *semantic property* of I. Since canonical models are, in general,
incomputable, we show how to (dis)prove semantic properties by satisfiability
in an *arbitrary* model A of Th(I). We apply these ideas to the analysis of
properties of programming languages and systems whose computations can be
described by means of an elementary inference system. In particular,
rewriting-based systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and understand Theta's verification techniques, design trade-offs, strengths, and weaknesses targeting CHC-COMP benchmarks for constrained Horn clauses.

Method: Theta transforms constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) into control-flow automata (CFAs) for analysis. The study includes detailed exploration of its algorithms, unique features, and performance evaluation using benchmark re-execution.

Result: Analysis reveals limitations and highlights improved performance when testing corrected settings compared to the 2025 CHC-COMP results.

Conclusion: Theta’s verification capabilities provide insights into performance challenges and improvements, emphasizing design trade-offs and learning from competitive benchmarks.

Abstract: Theta is a verification framework that has participated in the CHC-COMP
competition since 2023. While its core approach -- based on transforming
constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) into control-flow automata (CFAs) for analysis
-- has remained mostly unchanged, Theta's verification techniques, design
trade-offs, and limitations have remained mostly unexplored in the context of
CHCs. This paper fills that gap: we provide a detailed description of the
algorithms employed by Theta, highlighting the unique features that distinguish
it from other CHC solvers. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the
tool in the context of CHC-COMP benchmarks. Notably, in the 2025 edition of the
competition, Theta's performance was impacted by a configuration issue, leading
to suboptimal results. To provide a clearer picture of Theta's actual
capabilities, we re-execute the tool on the competition benchmarks under
corrected settings and report on the resulting performance.

*Thanh Le,Hai Duong,Yusheng Ji,ThanhVu Nguyen,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper highlights a security vulnerability in DRL-based MU-MIMO systems for 5G, showing adversaries can exploit observation normalizers to degrade network throughput significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and security challenges in DRL-based user selection for MU-MIMO in 5G systems, where adversarial users may exploit unsanitized CSI data.

Method: The researchers propose FGGM, a scheme leveraging polytope abstract domains to manipulate CSI data without requiring exact values to attack DRL-based systems.

Result: Experimental outcomes demonstrate FGGM can reduce victim network throughput by up to 70% using manipulated CSI data across a range of observations.

Conclusion: This case study reveals vulnerabilities in DRL-based MU-MIMO systems and highlights the applicability of the attacking scheme to similar DRL-based resource allocation problems.

Abstract: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance
spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral
efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to
selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is
NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal
solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.
This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit
unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing
studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact
values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink
transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an
observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to
improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and
lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based
solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by
leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of
a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of
intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the
whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate
that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by
adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce
the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value
of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be
applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource
allocation problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ORBIT, a new benchmark for evaluating recommendation systems using realistic user data and consistent evaluation criteria. It includes a novel webpage recommendation task called ClueWeb-Reco.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of recommender systems is challenged by unrealistic datasets and inconsistent evaluation guidelines, leading to ambiguous results.

Method: The paper introduces ORBIT, a benchmarking framework with public datasets, reproducible methods, and a hidden test dataset for measuring models' generalization abilities.

Result: ORBIT evaluates 12 recommendation models, revealing general improvements but showing limitations on large-scale webpage recommendations, highlighting the potential of LLM integration.

Conclusion: ORBIT provides a comprehensive tool for reproducible and realistic assessment of recommendation models, encouraging advancements in large-scale recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a recommender system that leverages a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with context-aware embeddings generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to overcome data sparsity and cold-start problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of data sparsity and cold-start issues that hinder the effectiveness of recommender systems, particularly for new or infrequent users.

Method: The method involves using a GAT-based Collaborative Filtering framework enhanced with LLM-generated textual embeddings for user profiles and item metadata. The system integrates these features into a bipartite user-item graph and employs a hybrid loss function combining Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust negative sampling.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods in Precision, NDCG, and MAP metrics on MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets. It also exhibits robustness for users with limited interaction history.

Conclusion: The study concludes that utilizing LLM-augmented embeddings and cosine similarity effectively addresses sparsity and cold-start issues in recommender systems. Future work will focus on balancing accuracy with diversity, fairness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

*Isaac Robledo,Juan Alfaro,Víctor Duro,Alberto Solera-Rico,Rodrigo Castellanos,Carlos Sanmiguel Vila*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This study explores reducing aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles using pulsed jet actuation optimized with a hybrid genetic algorithm, achieving approximately 10% drag reduction with energization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing aerodynamic drag in flat-backed vehicles is crucial for lowering fuel consumption and improving energy efficiency in transportation.

Method: A hybrid genetic algorithm was utilized to optimize actuation parameters for four pulsed jets in an experimental setup, targeting both drag reduction and energy efficiency.

Result: The optimization method achieved about 10% drag reduction by stabilizing and shifting the wake upward, improving pressure recovery on the model's lower base.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of model-free optimization in uncovering innovative and energy-efficient strategies for substantial drag reduction.

Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by
a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.
This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active
flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A
hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based
optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an
experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net
energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the
actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully
identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately
10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from
the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and
lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image
Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of
the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can
successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that
yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

*Peter Behroozi*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique based on ray tracing in parameter space with heightened resilience to stochastic gradients and improved sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of traditional MCMC methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, especially in handling likelihood barriers and enhancing computational efficiency when sampling posterior neural network distributions.

Method: A ray tracing sampler propagates rays at constant speed through parameter space, enabling efficient posterior sampling, and is generalized to incorporate various prior samplers. Public code is provided for implementation.

Result: The method was successfully applied to sample posterior distributions for diverse neural networks, including GPT-2 with 1.5 billion parameters, using consumer-level GPUs.

Conclusion: This generalized ray tracing framework demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency and flexibility, suggesting its broad applicability for posterior sampling with diverse settings.

Abstract: We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler based on following ray paths in
a medium where the refractive index $n(x)$ is a function of the desired
likelihood $\mathcal{L}(x)$. The sampling method propagates rays at constant
speed through parameter space, leading to orders of magnitude higher resilience
to heating for stochastic gradients as compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC), as well as the ability to cross any likelihood barrier, including holes
in parameter space. Using the ray tracing method, we sample the posterior
distributions of neural network outputs for a variety of different
architectures, up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer 2) architecture, all on a single consumer-level GPU. We also show
that prior samplers including traditional HMC, microcanonical HMC, Metropolis,
Gibbs, and even Monte Carlo integration are special cases within a generalized
ray tracing framework, which can sample according to an arbitrary weighting
function. Public code and documentation for C, JAX, and PyTorch are available

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning pipeline for selecting radio pulsar candidates from GMRT data using array-derived features and image diagnostics, achieving an accuracy of 94%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of processing millions of pulsar candidates generated by surveys, which overwhelms manual inspection.

Method: The pipeline converts raw voltage data into filterbanks, dedisperses and folds candidates, and uses a fusion of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for array features and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image diagnostics. Generative augmentation, including GANs, is applied to tackle class imbalance.

Result: The proposed method improved accuracy from 68% (baseline model) to 94% using a refined CNN and GAN-based augmentation, achieving balanced precision and recall.

Conclusion: The combination of array and image features enhances classification, and the pipeline is suitable for high-throughput facilities and near-real-time applications.

Abstract: Pulsar surveys generate millions of candidates per run, overwhelming manual
inspection. This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar
candidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics.
From approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw
voltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded
across trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000
candidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics--summed profile, time vs.
phase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve--represented as arrays and images. A
baseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with
logistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN
architecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm
constraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including
a GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87%
accuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced
precision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough
for near--real-time triage. The results show that combining array and image
channels improves separability over image-only approaches, and that modest
generative augmentation substantially boosts minority (pulsar) recall. The
methods are survey-agnostic and extensible to forthcoming high-throughput
facilities.

*Chaithanya Naik Mude,Linipun Phuttitarn,Satvik Maurya,Kunal Sinha,Mark Saffman,Swamit Tannu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces GANDALF, a denoising framework to enhance quantum computer readout in neutral atom systems, achieving quicker and more accurate measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing with neutral atom systems faces challenges due to slow qubit readout, which hinders scalability and efficiency, particularly in performing quantum error correction cycles.

Method: The authors proposed GANDALF, a framework combining image denoising and lightweight classifiers, to improve measurement accuracy and speed by reconstructing clear signals from low-photon measurements.

Result: Applying GANDALF reduced QEC cycle time up to 1.77x and logical error rate by up to 35x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Using image denoising enhances the readout capability and overall performance of neutral atom-based quantum computers, making them more scalable and efficient for future applications.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of
thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout.
Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying
quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying
quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,
long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.
Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors
that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected
photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves
neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but
unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,
GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear
signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification
at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and
a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up
to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art
CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowQ-Net, a generative framework for automating the design of highly efficient quantum circuits, offering significant improvements in circuit compactness without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiency and error-proneness of quantum circuits, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Method: The authors propose FlowQ-Net, a framework using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sequentially design quantum circuits based on a user-defined reward function optimizing multiple design objectives.

Result: FlowQ-Net generated high-quality circuits that are 10-30 times more efficient in terms of parameters, gates, and depth compared to standard baselines while maintaining accuracy, and performed consistently under real-world error conditions.

Conclusion: Generative models like FlowQ-Net are effective for automated quantum circuit design and can accelerate quantum computing efficiency and scientific advancements in the field.

Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce
\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework
for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits
sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward
function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,
and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse
ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of
simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz
design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image
classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits
designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding
circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,
gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without
compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles
from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of
generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum
circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum
algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.

TL;DR: The paper investigates group interactions in pedestrian traffic, identifying different proxemic zones and patterns of interactions using naturalistic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how group dynamics and social norms influence pedestrian traffic behavior, particularly through proxemics.

Method: The study examines group zones, occupancy patterns, and clearance distances using naturalistic observational data.

Result: Findings suggest three distinct group zones beyond the public zone, with people primarily staying in the public zone and rare, brief closeness to groups.

Conclusion: Group proxemics play a critical role in crowd behavior, and interactions with groups are generally cautious and limited in duration.

Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a
significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social
norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social
settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the
emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people
clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate
potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone.
People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to
groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief
periods of time.

### [362] [Hybrid LLM and Higher-Order Quantum Approximate Optimization for CSA Collateral Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26217)
*Tao Jin,Stuart Florescu,Heyu,Jin*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid method for collateral optimization under ISDA CSAs, combining an evidence-gated LLM, quantum-inspired techniques, and CP-SAT to improve classical baselines by over 9% and deliver auditable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in optimizing collateral management under ISDA CSAs due to complex legal and financial constraints like caps, RA/MTA gating, and integer lot requirements, which create rugged and bounded search spaces.

Method: The proposed approach includes a hybrid pipeline: (i) evidence-gated language models for extracting CSA terms to JSON, (ii) quantum-inspired algorithms (simulated annealing and higher-order QAOA) for handling multi-asset optimization across constraints, (iii) a weighted objective balancing risk and cost factors, and (iv) CP-SAT for feasibility certification and verification.

Result: Using government bond datasets and multi-CSA inputs, the hybrid method improves performance by 9.1%-10.7% over a strong classical baseline across tested harnesses, demonstrating better cost-movement-tail trade-offs under governance settings.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline achieves significant optimization improvements while providing auditable, reproducible solutions tailored to complex financial and legal contexts.

Abstract: We address finance-native collateral optimization under ISDA Credit Support
Annexes (CSAs), where integer lots, Schedule A haircuts, RA/MTA gating, and
issuer/currency/class caps create rugged, legally bounded search spaces. We
introduce a certifiable hybrid pipeline purpose-built for this domain: (i) an
evidence-gated LLM that extracts CSA terms to a normalized JSON
(abstain-by-default, span-cited); (ii) a quantum-inspired explorer that
interleaves simulated annealing with micro higher order QAOA (HO-QAOA) on
binding sub-QUBOs (subset size n <= 16, order k <= 4) to coordinate multi-asset
moves across caps and RA-induced discreteness; (iii) a weighted risk-aware
objective (Movement, CVaR, funding-priced overshoot) with an explicit coverage
window U <= Reff+B; and (iv) CP-SAT as single arbiter to certify feasibility
and gaps, including a U-cap pre-check that reports the minimal feasible buffer
B*. Encoding caps/rounding as higher-order terms lets HO-QAOA target the domain
couplings that defeat local swaps. On government bond datasets and multi-CSA
inputs, the hybrid improves a strong classical baseline (BL-3) by 9.1%, 9.6%,
and 10.7% across representative harnesses, delivering better cost-movement-tail
frontiers under governance settings. We release governance grade artifacts-span
citations, valuation matrix audit, weight provenance, QUBO manifests, and
CP-SAT traces-to make results auditable and reproducible.

### [363] [Linking Heterogeneous Data with Coordinated Agent Flows for Social Media Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26172)
*Shifu Chen,Dazhen Deng,Zhihong Xu,Sijia Xu,Tai-Quan Peng,Yingcai Wu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: SIA (Social Insight Agents) is an LLM-driven system for analyzing heterogeneous social media data, integrating text, network, and behavior, with a focus on providing insightful analyses through human-agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of analyzing heterogeneous, complex social media data and to enable effective insights into phenomena like opinion dynamics and community formation.

Method: SIA employs a coordinated LLM agent system with a taxonomy-based approach to connect heterogeneous multi-modal data. It integrates raw inputs, analytical outputs, and visualizations using a dedicated data coordinator and provides an interactive interface for user collaboration.

Result: SIA demonstrates effective discovery of diverse and meaningful insights from social media data through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation.

Conclusion: SIA enhances social media analytics by tackling heterogeneity, enabling coherent strategies and fostering transparency and collaboration between humans and agents.

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,
capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network
structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as
opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,
discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually
challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.
Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language
models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot
adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA
(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous
multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral
data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization
artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy
that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,
SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure
multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies
tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive
interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and
refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.
Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that
SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media
while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

### [364] [Risks and Opportunities in Human-Machine Teaming in Operationalizing Machine Learning Target Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25974)
*Mengtian Guo,David Gotz,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how human-machine collaboration can improve the process of selecting proxy target variables for machine learning, highlighting opportunities and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive models often fail due to issues in defining abstract prediction targets using proxies, necessitating collaboration between domain experts and data scientists to achieve effective operationalization.

Method: The study explores two strategies—‘relevance-first’ (human-led proxy selection) and ‘performance-first’ (machine-recommended proxies)—using a controlled user study involving 20 participants in a proxy construction task.

Result: The ‘performance-first’ strategy enabled faster iteration and decision-making, but it also biased participants towards proxies that, while performing well, were not aligned with the application goals.

Conclusion: Human-machine teaming shows promise for enhancing proxy variable selection, but care must be taken to avoid over-reliance on machine-recommended proxies that may not align with the broader goals.

Abstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making.
However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem
formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or
construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a
proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate
proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain
knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently
collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work,
we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating
iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two
human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first:
humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2)
performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based
on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy
construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy
facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users
towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal.
Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in
operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for
future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.

*Xin Hu,Pengfei Xu,Jin Zhou,Hongbo Fu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces StructLayoutFormer, a Transformer-based method for structured layout generation with superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured layouts in visual content are preferred for their ease in editing but are challenging to create computationally without heavy labor input.

Method: The authors propose StructLayoutFormer, which uses a structure serialization scheme and disentangles structural information from element placements for conditional structured layout generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that StructLayoutFormer outperforms existing methods in structured layout generation and can effectively extract and transfer layout structures.

Conclusion: StructLayoutFormer is the first data-driven approach for explicitly generating conditional structured layouts, providing realistic and editable layout structures.

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient flow framework for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) using PDEs, offering practical algorithms and theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works focused on reformulation techniques and iterative algorithms for DRO lacked a unified gradient flow-based theoretical framework.

Method: The authors use gradient flow theory combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to construct practical algorithms for sampling worst-case distributions applicable in DRO.

Result: They showcase applications of their framework to Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO problems, providing improvements and theoretical validations through numerical studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework connects classic DRO methods with new gradient flow theory, creating opportunities for the development of novel algorithms and offering deeper insights into existing techniques.

Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in
the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory,
we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical
algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO.
While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques
and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the
distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an
example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO
problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein
variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our
framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide
new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical
studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our
theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual threat modeling is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated approach for effective risk identification and mitigation.

Method: The authors automate threat modeling by applying density-based and community detection clustering algorithms to call graphs, analyzing threats in the detected clusters, and validating the approach using a case study on Splunk Forwarder Operator (SFO).

Result: The results show the proposed automation method effectively identifies security weaknesses within call graph clusters, demonstrating feasibility and systematic performance for threat assessment.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, semi-automated framework for threat modeling, advancing capability for cloud-native environments while reducing error and labor intensity.

Abstract: Threat modeling plays a critical role in the identification and mitigation of
security risks; however, manual approaches are often labor intensive and prone
to error. This paper investigates the automation of software threat modeling
through the clustering of call graphs using density-based and community
detection algorithms, followed by an analysis of the threats associated with
the identified clusters. The proposed method was evaluated through a case study
of the Splunk Forwarder Operator (SFO), wherein selected clustering metrics
were applied to the software's call graph to assess pertinent code-density
security weaknesses. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach and
underscore its potential to facilitate systematic threat assessment. This work
contributes to the advancement of scalable, semi-automated threat modeling
frameworks tailored for modern cloud-native environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system using acoustic emissions to verify the accuracy of robotic commands in real-time using machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure robots execute their intended commands reliably in sensitive environments, providing a passive and cost-effective verification method.

Method: The framework utilizes acoustic side-channel analysis and machine learning classifiers (SVM, DNN, RNN, CNN) to analyze sounds generated by robot movements and verify consistency with intended behaviors.

Result: The proposed system achieved over 80% accuracy in validating robot movements and identifying workflows such as pick-and-place and packing operations.

Conclusion: Acoustic signals can enable real-time, low-cost, and hardware-independent verification, enhancing reliability in robotic operations.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side-channel
analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its
intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow
verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic
movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent
with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,
direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot
movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions
using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be
identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that
acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in
sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the distinct security and governance challenges of autonomous, AI-driven systems, which traditional tools are ill-suited for.

Method: AAGATE operationalizes the NIST AI RMF, integrates multiple security frameworks, adopts a zero-trust service mesh, explainable policy, and analytics, and extends governance with DIRF, LPCI, and QSAF.

Result: AAGATE provides a robust, continuous governance solution for autonomous AI systems, tackling systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AAGATE enables safe, accountable, and scalable deployment of agentic AI through innovative governance structures.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance & Trust Engine
(AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique
security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven
agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application
Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE
operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates
specialized security frameworks for each RMF function: the Agentic AI Threat
Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC
for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for
Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy
engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE
provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling
safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended
with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection,
and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FakeZero, a browser extension for client-side fake-news detection on social platforms using Transformer models for real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the rapid spread of misinformation on platforms like Facebook and X by offering users reliable detection of fake news posts while maintaining data privacy.

Method: FakeZero uses client-side processing with advanced Transformer models like DistilBERT-Quant and TinyBERT-Quant. It integrates fine-tuning techniques, domain adaptation, adversarial training, and quantisation for efficient performance.

Result: The DistilBERT-Quant model achieves 97.1% macro-F1 and 97.4% accuracy, while its TinyBERT-Quant version maintains 95.7% macro-F1 with reduced size and latency.

Conclusion: FakeZero efficiently balances accuracy with resource constraints, serving as a practical tool against misinformation and enabling large-scale data collection for advancing fake-news detection.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIRAJ, a red-teaming framework for assessing vulnerabilities in black-box LLM agents using a dynamic two-step method to improve risk outcome coverage and attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model (LLM) agents face new safety risks due to their capacity for planning and tool invocation, making it necessary to discover and mitigate vulnerabilities for their safe deployment.

Method: SIRAJ employs a two-step process: generating diverse seed test cases for risk coverage and iteratively crafting adversarial attacks based on prior execution results. It incorporates model distillation for cost optimization, using structured reasoning to train smaller yet effective models.

Result: The seed test case generation boosts coverage by 2-2.5x, and the distilled 8B model doubles attack success rate compared to the much larger Deepseek-R1 model, showcasing superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The iterative framework and structured reasoning methods validate the effectiveness of SIRAJ in identifying and addressing risks in LLM agents while optimizing cost and generalizing the red-teamer's capabilities.

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

### [374] [PVMark: Enabling Public Verifiability for LLM Watermarking Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26274)
*Haohua Duan,Liyao Xiang,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PVMark introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based plugin addressing trust issues in detecting text watermarks for large language models without revealing secret keys, ensuring public verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve trust and transparency issues in watermark detection for texts generated by large language models. Current solutions are opaque as they rely on secret keys that compromise public verifiability and invite removal attacks.

Method: PVMark employs zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology to allow public verification of watermark detection steps without exposing secret keys. It incorporates specific ZKP constraints for various operations, ensuring secure and verifiable detection.

Result: Different implementations of PVMark in Python, Rust, and Circom demonstrate effectiveness for diverse LLM watermarking schemes, using multiple hash functions and ZKP protocols. Experimental data supports its efficiency and practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: PVMark provides a public verifiability solution for LLM watermarking detection, balancing transparency with security, and is suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning architecture integrating GNNs, RNNs, and attention mechanisms to improve intrusion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cybersecurity systems need advanced methods for detecting complex attack patterns efficiently in real-time.

Method: The method combines GNNs for spatial relationships, RNNs for temporal analysis, and attention mechanisms for interpretability and feature selection.

Result: The hybrid model outperformed traditional and standalone models in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, excelling in detecting sophisticated cyber threats.

Conclusion: The proposed model is effective for next-generation cybersecurity applications in challenging network environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that
synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance
cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive
UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach
effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural
relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network
events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved
model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity
analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a
critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our
extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model
achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning
approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation
metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model
achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack
patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution
for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized commercial use of datasets infringes intellectual property rights, and existing verification methods face limitations such as detectability issues and vulnerability of static watermark patterns.

Method: The authors propose SSCL-BW, which employs a U-Net-based sample generator to produce unique clean-label watermarks for each sample, leveraging a composite loss function to ensure effectiveness, reliability, and imperceptibility.

Result: Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, SSCL-BW shows effectiveness in ownership verification and robustness against potential watermark removal attempts.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses limitations of traditional watermarking methods by introducing a sample-specific clean-label backdoor method, providing an improved solution to dataset ownership verification.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on
large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of
these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset
owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer
from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to
label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical
complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches
employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label
backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked
sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,
fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The
core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three
components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target
sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss
maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box
testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined
backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential
watermark removal attacks.

### [377] [A Survey of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26307)
*Laura Jiang,Reza Ryan,Qian Li,Nasim Ferdosian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper surveys the use of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) for anomaly detection in cybersecurity, addressing limitations and providing a structured analysis of approaches, benchmarks, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for effective anomaly detection in cybersecurity contexts, which require models capable of handling heterogeneity and temporal evolution of real-world data.

Method: The authors provide a taxonomy of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods, analyze representative models, review benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and identify open challenges in the field.

Result: The survey maps anomaly detection methods to cybersecurity applications, highlights the strengths and limitations of benchmarks, and outlines research gaps regarding modeling, data, and deployment.

Conclusion: This study serves as a structured foundation to advance HGNN-based anomaly detection methods, guiding future research toward scalable and practically useful solutions in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying
insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for
ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly
important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and
static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and
temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by
incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,
enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current
research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse
modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of
standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey
of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a
taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze
representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting
their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges
related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for
future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for
advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and
practically deployable solutions.

### [378] [Discovering Interpretable Biological Concepts in Single-cell RNA-seq Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25807)
*Charlotte Claye,Pierre Marschall,Wassila Ouerdane,Céline Hudelot,Julien Duquesne*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper introduces a concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell RNA-seq models, enhancing biological discovery by moving beyond black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve interpretability in single-cell RNA-seq foundation models as they are effective for downstream tasks but remain opaque for biological discovery.

Method: The authors propose attribution methods with counterfactual perturbations to identify influential genes and provide two interpretation approaches: expert-driven analysis using interactive tools and ontology-driven methods via pathway enrichment.

Result: Applying this framework to Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on immune cell datasets demonstrated improved interpretability while maintaining latent representation richness.

Conclusion: The framework enables interpreting biological concepts encoded in models and aids in hypothesis generation for advancing biological discoveries.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on
downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological
discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract
concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical
imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains
challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We
introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell
RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We
propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies
genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches
like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary
interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an
interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based
biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known
single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted
by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a
domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability
compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and
informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled
framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have
encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: The study explores industry stakeholders' viewpoints on the ABET accreditation process in an Ecuadorian engineering program.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how industry stakeholders perceive the ABET accreditation process and its impact on employability in less industrialized contexts.

Method: Qualitative research including interviews with industry stakeholders involved in the advisory board of an ABET-accredited Ecuadorian engineering program.

Result: The findings provide perspectives on the relevance of degree outcomes, accreditation value, and graduate employability.

Conclusion: Insights emphasize the applicability and implications of ABET accreditation in non-highly-industrialized contexts, especially for graduate employment.

Abstract: ABET accreditation is an increasingly prominent system of global
accreditation of engineering programs, and the assessment requires programs to
demonstrate that they meet the needs of the program's stakeholders, typically
industrial potential employers of graduates. To obtain these inputs, programs
are required to assemble an advisory committee board. The views of the advisory
board on the relevance of the degree outcomes are an essential part of this
process. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore the
viewpoints that industry stakeholders have on this type of process. The context
for the study was an Ecuadorian engineering program which had successfully
achieved the ABET accreditation. The study drew on interviews undertaken with
industry members who were part of the advisory board. This study focuses on how
they perceive the process and the accreditation awarded, analyzing their views
of its usefulness, especially in relation to the employability of graduates.
Based on the findings, we offer critical insights into this accreditation
process when it takes place in contexts beyond highly industrialized countries.

TL;DR: Flex-GAD is an unsupervised framework for graph anomaly detection, using community-based GCN and attribute encoders fused via a self-attention module to detect node anomalies efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve anomaly detection in attributed networks to address challenges such as fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in various domains like social networks and e-commerce.

Method: Flex-GAD uses two encoders: a community-based GCN encoder for structural information and an attribute encoder, which are fused via a self-attention-based representation module to enhance anomaly detection.

Result: Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over prior methods, while being significantly faster, reducing training time 102x compared to Anomaly DAE and 3x faster than GAD-NR.

Conclusion: Flex-GAD is effective and flexible for graph anomaly detection, offering superior accuracy and efficiency across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, where each node is
associated with both structural connections and descriptive attributes, is
essential for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in
domains such as social networks, academic citation graphs, and e-commerce
platforms. We propose Flex-GAD, a novel unsupervised framework for graph
anomaly detection at the node level. Flex-GAD integrates two encoders to
capture complementary aspects of graph data. The framework incorporates a novel
community-based GCN encoder to model intra-community and inter-community
information into node embeddings, thereby ensuring structural consistency,
along with a standard attribute encoder. These diverse representations are
fused using a self-attention-based representation fusion module, which enables
adaptive weighting and effective integration of the encoded information. This
fusion mechanism allows automatic emphasis of the most relevant node
representation across different encoders. We evaluate Flex-GAD on seven
real-world attributed graphs with varying sizes, node degrees, and attribute
homogeneity. Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over the
previously best-performing method, GAD-NR, demonstrating its effectiveness and
flexibility across diverse graph structures. Moreover, it significantly reduces
training time, running 102x faster per epoch than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster per
epoch than GAD-NR on average across seven benchmark datasets.

*Sadegh Shirani,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper explores political mobilization in online networks using agent-based simulations integrating real-world data, Twitter topology, and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how online social networks influence political mobilization and voter behavior at large scales.

Method: The study uses an agent-based simulation framework incorporating demographic data, Twitter network topology, and LLM agents to replicate social interactions and analyze effects on voter turnout.

Result: The simulation replicated real-world patterns, showing stronger mobilization effects with social message treatments and peer spillovers.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a reproducible tool for testing political mobilization strategies, bridging field experiments and computational modeling.

Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political
mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer
influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person
Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation
framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic
Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents
to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated
agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an
LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})
reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social
network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their
engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate
the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook
study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed
in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social
message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a
controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and
sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge
between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational
modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular control framework for UAVs, focusing on efficient three-dimensional ellipsoidal obstacle avoidance using model predictive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous UAV navigation by addressing computational challenges and introducing efficient methods for detecting and avoiding static/moving obstacles in 3D environments.

Method: The paper uses a modular framework that incorporates a computationally efficient and differentiable collision detection condition. A two-stage optimization process is utilized to tackle numerical challenges in the resulting control problem.

Result: The proposed framework was successfully tested via simulations and real-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. It demonstrated effective obstacle avoidance and path-following capability.

Conclusion: The study provides the first real-world validation of such an MPC-based UAV controller for a 3D task, emphasizing its feasibility and effectiveness in handling obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: This article proposes a modular optimal control framework for local
three-dimensional ellipsoidal obstacle avoidance, exemplarily applied to model
predictive path-following control. Static as well as moving obstacles are
considered. Central to the approach is a computationally efficient and
continuously differentiable condition for detecting collisions with ellipsoidal
obstacles. A novel two-stage optimization approach mitigates numerical issues
arising from the structure of the resulting optimal control problem. The
effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and
real-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first
hardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a
three-dimensional task.

*Maarten P. Scholl,Mahmoud Mahfouz,Anisoara Calinescu,J. Doyne Farmer*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative framework for learning latent investment strategies of fund managers without explicitly specifying utility functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with modeling complex, multi-objective strategies of fund managers due to challenges in specifying and parameterizing utility functions.

Method: Utilizes a GAN-based architecture to model the conditional probability of fund portfolio weights based on market data and latent strategy representations.

Result: The framework successfully captures known investment styles and implicit objectives, validated on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds with interpretable results.

Conclusion: The approach provides a data-driven method for characterizing investment strategies and has applications in simulation, attribution, and regulatory oversight.

Abstract: While investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms,
their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go
beyond simple risk-return trade-offs. Traditional approaches attempt to model
this through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges
in specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that
learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring
explicit utility specification.
  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's
portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous
weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods
based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified
rewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns
directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.
  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The
learned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as
"growth" and "value," while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For
instance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of
Markowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for
turnover, concentration, and latent factors.
  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests
that explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are
contained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.
  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment
strategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and
regulatory oversight.

TL;DR: RNAGenScape is a novel framework for mRNA design optimization using a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics approach, effective even in scenarios with limited and imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for effective mRNA optimization techniques in synthetic biology and therapeutic development, which are hindered by scarce data and complex relationships between sequence and function.

Method: The authors propose RNAGenScape, combining an organized autoencoder for latent space structuring with a manifold projector for maintaining biological plausibility and intermediate results within the viable mRNA manifold.

Result: RNAGenScape improves mRNA target properties with high success rates across three real-world datasets, outperforming existing generative and optimization methods for proteins and non-biological data.

Conclusion: RNAGenScape offers a scalable solution for controllable mRNA design, enhancing optimization and latent space exploration even under data-scarce conditions, while providing insights into the impact of sequence edits on function.

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.

*Yilong Lu,Si Chen,Songyan Gao,Han Liu,Xin Dong,Wenfeng Shen,Guangtai Ding*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to improving mirror-image peptide sequencing by optimizing peptide design using a deep learning model called DBond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of storage limitations in traditional media and the low accuracy of mirror-image peptide sequencing due to limited datasets and algorithmic inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduced DBond, a deep neural network model that integrates sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry factors to predict peptide bond cleavage, aiding in sequence optimization and improving sequencing accuracy.

Result: The study introduced a new dataset (MiPD513), developed a peptide bond cleavage labeling algorithm, and implemented a dual prediction strategy, achieving superior performance in sequencing tasks on independent datasets.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that sequence optimization through advanced prediction models significantly enhances the sequencing accuracy of mirror-image peptides, paving the way for their use as a viable storage medium.

Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face
limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of
data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have
emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage
density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of
mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its
accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and
the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides
directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy
indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this
work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates
sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry
environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.
In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are
easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as
follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset
containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond
cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million
labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy
that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent
test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods
in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a
strong foundation for sequence optimization.

*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SP-MCQA as a new evaluation method for TTS systems, highlighting the limitations of traditional metrics like WER in assessing intelligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS evaluation methods heavily rely on word accuracy metrics like WER, but these fail to reflect real-world speech complexity and human comprehension.

Method: The authors propose a subjective evaluation framework called Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering (SP-MCQA), complemented by an 8.76-hour benchmark dataset called SP-MCQA-Eval.

Result: The experiments show that low WER scores don't always mean high intelligibility, revealing gaps between traditional metrics and actual comprehension of synthesized speech.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need for new, more realistic evaluation criteria for TTS systems, as even state-of-the-art models struggle with text normalization and phonetic accuracy.

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

*Weifei Jin,Yuxin Cao,Junjie Su,Minhui Xue,Jie Hao,Ke Xu,Jin Song Dong,Derui Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALMGuard, a new defense framework designed to protect Audio-Language Models (ALMs) from jailbreak attacks, achieving high robustness while preserving utility in benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses are ineffective against vulnerabilities unique to Audio-Language Models, necessitating tailored solutions.

Method: The paper proposes ALMGuard, incorporating Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) and Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM) to activate safety shortcuts while minimizing impact on benign tasks.

Result: ALMGuard successfully reduces jailbreak attack success rates to 4.6% on average across four models, maintaining strong performance on regular tasks.

Conclusion: ALMGuard provides robust protection against attacks specific to ALMs and establishes a new benchmark in defense while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: This paper explores how large-scale language model (LLM) agents interact within simulated marketplaces, studying their behaviors, biases, and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of understanding about the behavior of LLM agents in complex, realistic market conditions where various agents interact dynamically.

Method: To achieve this, the authors created a simulated environment called Magentic-Marketplace, where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent businesses. Experiments were conducted to analyze market dynamics and agent behavior.

Result: The study found that models can achieve optimal welfare under ideal conditions but face significant performance declines as the scale increases. It also uncovered severe biases, such as first-proposal bias, which disproportionately favors response speed over quality.

Conclusion: The findings from this study highlight the emergence of specific agent behaviors in complex market settings. These insights are crucial for designing fair and effective agent-mediated marketplaces.

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions,
ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such
applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent
accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires
understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,
previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as
single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent
interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require
agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,
dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in
open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic
marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents
represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop
Magentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services
can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the
utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and
how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier
models can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.
Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe
first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over
quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,
informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

TL;DR: The paper examines algorithmic collusion using a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in market making and proposes metrics to analyze emergent interaction patterns. Experimental findings suggest agents exhibit different behaviors impacting market dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address whether interactions between different AI agents in markets will lead to emergent behaviors like collusion or market dominance and how this affects overall market dynamics.

Method: The authors developed a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with different market agents (self-interested, competitive, hybrid) interacting in a structured setting to understand behaviors and propose relevant metrics for analysis.

Result: Agent B2 showcases aggressive behavior leading to increased efficiency, while Agent B* adapts to secure market dominance but with relatively milder negative impacts on peers.

Conclusion: Adaptive incentive control fosters more sustainable coexistence among diverse agent types, providing a structured way to analyze behavioral dynamics in algorithmic trading systems.

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

Motivation: Multi-Agent Systems often face inefficiencies due to increased autonomy and complexity, requiring proactive solutions to address error correction and improve robustness.

Method: SupervisorAgent is a modular framework with a runtime adaptive supervision mechanism, employing an LLM-free adaptive filter for error correction, behavioral guidance, and observation purification.

Result: SupervisorAgent reduces token consumption by 29.45% on the GAIA benchmark and shows robustness across multiple benchmarks and foundation models.

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent proves effective in enhancing efficiency and robustness in Multi-Agent Systems while maintaining success rates, with potential for broad foundational model applications.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available

### [391] [A General Incentives-Based Framework for Fairness in Multi-agent Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26740)
*Ashwin Kumar,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents GIFF, a novel framework integrating fairness into multi-agent resource allocation by leveraging reinforcement learning's Q-function, achieving equitable outcomes across various domains without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inequitable outcomes in multi-agent resource allocation settings where agents optimizing for efficiency result in fairness imbalances.

Method: GIFF uses Q-functions to compute local fairness gains and introduces a counterfactual advantage correction term to address over-allocation to well-off agents within a centralized decision-making framework. It formalizes fair allocation without requiring extra training.

Result: Empirical evaluations showed that GIFF surpasses existing baselines across various domains like ridesharing and job allocation, achieving equitable and forward-looking policies.

Conclusion: GIFF is a robust framework that effectively balances fairness and efficiency using standard reinforcement learning methods, supported by strong theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.

*Linzhuang Sun,Tianyu Guo,Hao Liang,Yuying Li,Qifeng Cai,Jingxuan Wei,Bihui Yu,Wentao Zhang,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DySQL-Bench introduces a benchmark for Text-to-SQL models, focusing on dynamic multi-turn interactions rather than static single-turn tasks. GPT-4 struggles with this challenging benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL models perform well in static, single-turn tasks but face challenges in dynamic, iterative scenarios where user intents evolve over multiple turns.

Method: DySQL-Bench uses a two-stage automated pipeline of task synthesis and verification to create datasets. It employs structured tree representations for LLM-based task generation, filters for realistic interactions, and validates with expert reviews.

Result: DySQL-Bench spans 13 domains with 1,072 tasks, revealing difficulties faced by advanced models like GPT-4, which achieves a low accuracy of 58.34% and 23.81% on Pass@5.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for further development in handling dynamic Text-to-SQL tasks, serving as a crucial dataset and framework for evaluating interactive queries.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a physics-informed deep learning model that addresses misalignment issues in multiparametric MRI maps, enhancing tissue characterization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between multiparametric MRI maps creates challenges in pixel-wise analysis, hindering accurate myocardial tissue characterization.

Method: The authors developed a physics-informed deep learning model with test-time adaptation, leveraging synthetic images from specific physics models to register multiparametric maps.

Result: Validation in healthy volunteers showed improved multi-modal registration across diverse MRI sequences and image contrasts.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves registration of multiparametric MRI maps, enabling better myocardial tissue characterization across varying contrasts and conditions.

Abstract: Multiparametric mapping MRI has become a viable tool for myocardial tissue
characterization. However, misalignment between multiparametric maps makes
pixel-wise analysis challenging. To address this challenge, we developed a
generalizable physics-informed deep-learning model using test-time adaptation
to enable group image registration across contrast weighted images acquired
from multiple physical models (e.g., a T1 mapping model and T2 mapping model).
The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific
physics model as registration reference, allows for transductive learning for
various tissue contrast. We validated the model in healthy volunteers with
various MRI sequences, demonstrating its improvement for multi-modal
registration with a wide range of image contrast variability.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPG-CDENet, a two-stage deep learning model enhancing multi-organ segmentation accuracy by combining spatial priors and cross dual encoder networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods struggle with multi-organ segmentation due to high variations in organ size and shape.

Method: Proposes SPG-CDENet, comprising a spatial prior network to generate coarse ROI maps and a cross dual encoder network for feature extraction, refinement, and fusion using global and local encoders, cross-attention modules, and flow-based decoders.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show that SPG-CDENet outperforms existing segmentation methods, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its modules.

Conclusion: SPG-CDENet improves segmentation accuracy and sets a new benchmark for multi-organ segmentation using deep learning methods.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on olive tree biovolume estimation using deep learning models U-Net, YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask R-CNN on UAV imagery, comparing segmentation performance and operational suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision agriculture, especially in Mediterranean regions affected by climate stress, by estimating olive tree biovolume for yield prediction and effective resource management.

Method: Manual annotation of UAV imagery for olive tree crown and shadow segmentation, followed by biovolume estimation using spatial feature extraction and solar geometry-based metrics of crown area and shadow-derived height.

Result: Mask R-CNN demonstrated the highest accuracy (F1=0.86; mIoU=0.72), YOLOv11m-seg was the fastest (0.12 sec/image), while U-Net provided good sensitivity. Biovolume estimates ranged between 4 to 24 cubic meters.

Conclusion: Mask R-CNN is optimal for high accuracy needs, YOLOv11m-seg for fast applications, and U-Net for lightweight tasks. The framework supports scalable orchard monitoring, with potential improvements via field calibration and DEM/DSM integration.

Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,
supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in
Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study
presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,
YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows
in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over
Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building
on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and
robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown
projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,
Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while
YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The
estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,
reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate
Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas
YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net
remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,
scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM
integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAMRI adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for MRI segmentation using an efficient fine-tuning strategy, achieving high accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI segmentation is time-consuming and CNN-based methods struggle with MRI-specific challenges like variable contrast and intensity inhomogeneity.

Method: SAMRI fine-tunes the mask decoder of SAM using a two-stage strategy, trained on a large MRI dataset of 1.1 million labeled slices.

Result: SAMRI achieves a mean Dice score of 0.87, providing state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness to unseen and clinically critical structures.

Conclusion: SAMRI demonstrates that a transformer-based SAM can be efficiently adapted for high-performance MRI segmentation, reducing training time and parameters while maintaining accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces BRIQA, an automated method to improve assessing artifact severity in pediatric brain MRI with enhanced class balance and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, accurate, and objective solutions for assessing artifact severity in pediatric brain MRI, especially in low-field systems, due to challenges in manual assessment.

Method: BRIQA utilizes gradient-based loss reweighting and a rotating batching scheme to address class imbalance and improve artifact severity classification.

Result: BRIQA showed performance improvement across all metrics, raising average macro F1 scores from 0.659 to 0.706 and achieving significant classification enhancements for multiple artifact types.

Conclusion: BRIQA demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging architectural diversity and balanced learning strategies to improve diagnostic accuracy in pediatric brain MRI artifact severity assessment.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)
artifact severity classification. The code is available at

Method: ProstNFound+ leverages a medical foundation model with adapter tuning and a prompt encoder embedding clinical biomarkers specific to prostate cancer, evaluated using retrospective and prospective data.

Result: ProstNFound+ generalizes well to prospective data, aligns with standard clinical scoring protocols, and provides interpretable outputs consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions.

Conclusion: The model showcases scalability and interpretability, offering an effective alternative to traditional expert-driven protocols for clinical deployment in prostate cancer detection.

Abstract: Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build
high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate
cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in
clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa
detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:
ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt
encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective
evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable
heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results
highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and
interpretable alternative to expert-driven protocols.

Motivation: Current deep learning methods for CT reconstruction lack generalization across various anatomies and lesions, limiting their applicability.

Method: A new dataset called MORE, including CT scans of 9 anatomies and 15 lesion types, is provided for robust model training and evaluation.

Result: Comprehensive datasets enhance model generalization, and optimization-based methods improve robustness for unseen anatomies.

Conclusion: The MORE dataset improves CT reconstruction generalization; it is freely available to support further research and applications.

Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies
with 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust
training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)
facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of
models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen
anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid method combining a differentiable particle-mesh solver with a neural network to model cosmological field-level inference, demonstrating improvements in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in cosmological field-level inference by combining dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics and gravity efficiently.

Method: Use a hybrid model combining a differentiable particle-mesh solver for gravitational forces and a neural network representing hydrodynamics via an effective pressure field.

Result: The proposed model outperforms alternative methods, like Enthalpy Gradient Descent, in accuracy and summary-statistics, requiring only minimal simulation data.

Conclusion: This method is highly data efficient and can be directly trained with observational data, opening opportunities for better cosmological inference approaches.

Abstract: Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models
that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics
and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are
computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics
are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective
pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative
approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field
and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient,
with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being
sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for
future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data,
rather than a training set of simulations.

TL;DR: This paper explores decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided matching markets using matrix completion, addressing challenges caused by matching-induced dependence and proposing methods for estimation and hypothesis testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-sided matching markets generate constrained observed data due to matching capacity, which complicates statistical tasks like estimation and inference.

Method: The paper introduces a non-convex algorithm (Grassmannian gradient descent) and a debiasing and projection framework for uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing under dependent sampling conditions.

Result: The proposed methods achieve near-optimal convergence rates for three matching mechanisms and provide asymptotic normality guarantees with finite-sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate estimation, valid statistical inference, and effective evaluation of matching policies in two-sided matching markets.

Abstract: This paper studies decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided
matching markets via matrix completion. In contrast to the independent sampling
assumed in classical matrix completion literature, the observed entries, which
arise from past matching data, are constrained by matching capacity. This
matching-induced dependence poses new challenges for both estimation and
inference in the matrix completion framework. We propose a non-convex algorithm
based on Grassmannian gradient descent and establish near-optimal entrywise
convergence rates for three canonical mechanisms, i.e., one-to-one matching,
one-to-many matching with one-sided random arrival, and two-sided random
arrival. To facilitate valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing
on matching decisions, we further develop a general debiasing and projection
framework for arbitrary linear forms of the reward matrix, deriving asymptotic
normality with finite-sample guarantees under matching-induced dependent
sampling. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides accurate estimation, valid confidence intervals, and efficient
evaluation of matching policies.

*Usman Akram,Fan Zhang,Yang Li,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust method for improving channel state information (CSI) in 5G NR systems using diffusion-based inpainting techniques for sparse non-uniform uplink Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable multiuser MIMO operation in 5G NR systems requires accurate CSI, but current solutions face resource and coverage constraints. Existing techniques such as masked-autoencoder approaches degrade under unseen distortions.

Method: The paper proposes a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that incorporates system-model knowledge during inference using a likelihood-gradient term. This method allows a single trained model to adapt under mismatched conditions.

Result: The diffusion-based framework outperforms existing methods, like UNet and masked-autoencoders, especially under distribution shifts such as Laplace noise or user interference, achieving up to 14 dB NMSE improvements in challenging settings.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting is a generalizable and robust technique for enhancing CSI in sparse SRS design for 5G NR systems.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical AoA estimation methods require large arrays and extensive data collection, while ML techniques often lack physical interpretability. The paper aims to bridge the gap between high accuracy and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose SABER, a symbolic regression framework that derives interpretable mathematical models for AoA estimation from path loss measurements. The method is validated using controlled experiments and real-world testbeds.

Result: Using SABER, sub-0.5 degree Mean Absolute Error was achieved in controlled settings. In real-world indoor environments, near-zero error recovery of AoA was demonstrated. Comparisons to CRLBs show high accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: SABER offers a promising bridge between classical physics-driven models and black-box ML methods, providing interpretable and reliable AoA estimations suitable for modern wireless systems.

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.
