### [1] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduced the DDFT protocol to measure how robustly language models maintain factual accuracy under semantic compression and adversarial challenges, revealing that robustness is independent of model size or architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in measuring a language model's robustness in maintaining factual accuracy under real-world stress conditions, as static benchmarks fail to assess these aspects.

Method: The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT) assesses epistemic robustness by evaluating 9 models across 8 domains, measuring their accuracy under semantic compression and adversarial fabrication processes.

Result: Epistemic robustness was found to be independent of model size or architecture, but strongly correlated with error detection abilities. Smaller models were observed to perform robustly despite assumptions favoring larger models.

Conclusion: The DDFT framework challenges conventional paradigms by highlighting error detection's role in robustness, providing a practical and theoretical tool to evaluate models for critical applications.

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

*Xu Huang,Junwu Chen,Yuxing Fei,Zhuohan Li,Philippe Schwaller,Gerbrand Ceder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CASCADE, a framework enabling language models to acquire skills and continuously evolve for scientific research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely heavily on predefined tools, limiting their effectiveness in complex scientific tasks, necessitating a self-evolving framework.

Method: The CASCADE framework focuses on two meta-skills: continuous learning through web searches and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration.

Result: CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5 on the SciSkillBench benchmark, compared to 35.4% without its evolution mechanisms.

Conclusion: CASCADE demonstrates the potential of skill acquisition in LLMs, enabling them to handle complex tasks and collaborate with humans, paving the way for scalable AI in scientific research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

*Ioanna Gemou,Evangelos Lamprou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents McCoy, a disease prediction framework combining large language models (LLMs) and answer set programming (ASP) for interpretable and robust diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in symbolic AI adoption in healthcare by reducing the effort required to build high-quality knowledge bases for disease prediction.

Method: The McCoy framework uses LLMs to translate medical literature into ASP code, integrates it with patient data, and uses an ASP solver for disease diagnosis.

Result: Preliminary results indicate McCoy performs well on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: McCoy demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs with ASP for accurate, interpretable, and robust disease prediction.

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

### [4] [SPARK: Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24008)
*Gaurab Chhetri,Subasish Das,Tausif Islam Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPARK introduces a multi-agent LLM framework that enables dynamic, persona-based search personalization, combining retrieval, reasoning, and collaborative mechanisms to refine human information-seeking experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static profiles and monolithic retrieval pipelines in personalized search, where evolving and multi-dimensional user needs aren't adequately met.

Method: SPARK employs persona-driven LLM agents with distinct roles, expertise, and memory systems performing independent retrieval-augmented generation. These agents collaborate using structured communication protocols guided by minimal coordination rules for emergent personalization.

Result: SPARK offers enhanced efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while continuously refining personas through adaptive learning mechanisms based on distributed agent behaviors.

Conclusion: SPARK provides a robust framework for next-gen personalized search systems, capable of capturing user complexity and adapting dynamically to evolving needs, leveraging efficient multi-agent coordination mechanisms.

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

### [5] [ROAD: Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging for Zero-Shot Agent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24040)
*Natchaya Temyingyong,Daman Jain,Neeraj Kumarsahu,Prabhat Kumar,Rachata Phondi,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittanon Kaewtawee,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROAD is a framework design that optimizes LLM behaviors without requiring curated datasets, instead analyzing and automating debugging processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing APO methods which rely heavily on large, labeled datasets not commonly available during early-phase software engineering deployment.

Method: ROAD employs a multi-agent system (Analyzer, Optimizer, and Coach) to analyze failure logs and generate structured protocols using a reflective optimization approach.

Result: ROAD demonstrated improved efficiency and performance with a 5.6% increase in success rate and a 19% improvement in performance in complex retail reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The ROAD framework offers a practical, data-efficient method for LLM optimization, inspired by human debugging and patching workflows, and may replace resource-demanding RL processes.

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

### [6] [LoongFlow: Directed Evolutionary Search via a Cognitive Plan-Execute-Summarize Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24077)
*Chunhui Wan,Xunan Dai,Zhuo Wang,Minglei Li,Yanpeng Wang,Yinan Mao,Yu Lan,Zhiwen Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LoongFlow is a novel self-evolving agent framework designed to enhance solution quality while minimizing computational costs. It utilizes structured reasoning through a Plan-Execute-Summarize paradigm, balancing exploration and exploitation via a hybrid evolutionary system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of traditional evolutionary approaches for self-improving agents, such as premature convergence and inefficient exploration, particularly in high-dimensional code spaces.

Method: LoongFlow combines LLMs in a cognitive PES paradigm with hybrid evolutionary memory systems that use Multi-Island models, MAP-Elites, and adaptive Boltzmann selection to balance trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.

Result: LoongFlow significantly outperforms leading baselines in evolutionary efficiency (up to 60% improvement) and solution quality in tasks like algorithmic discovery and ML pipeline optimization.

Conclusion: LoongFlow represents a major advancement in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling efficient generation of high-quality solutions with less computational effort, setting a new standard in self-evolving agent frameworks.

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

### [7] [CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113)
*Jiaxin Hu,Tao Wang,Bingsan Yang,Hongrun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogRec, a cognitive recommender agent combining LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture to improve recommendation systems’ accuracy, explainability, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in understanding preferences but face challenges like black-box traits, knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning. Soar offers structured reasoning but struggles with knowledge acquisition. The paper aims to bridge these complementary strengths and weaknesses.

Method: CogRec integrates LLMs for knowledge initialization and Soar as a symbolic reasoning engine. It operates in a Perception-Cognition-Action cycle, utilizing Soar’s chunking mechanism for dynamic, interpretable online learning via LLM queries during impasses.

Result: Experiments on three datasets reveal improvements in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and tackling the long-tail problem through CogRec.

Conclusion: CogRec represents an innovative approach that combines structured reasoning with dynamic learning and interpretable recommendation rationale, addressing key limitations of standalone LLMs and cognitive architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

### [8] [Graph-Based Exploration for ARC-AGI-3 Interactive Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24156)
*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces a training-free, graph-based method to solve ARC-AGI-3 interactive reasoning benchmarks, outperforming LLM agents. The method uses visual frame processing and state-space exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fail in solving complex interactive reasoning tasks in ARC-AGI-3 due to their inability to track states, test hypotheses effectively, and grasp task dynamics.

Method: Combining vision-based frame segmentation, graph-structured state representation, and systematic state-space exploration, the agent prioritizes actions via salience and short paths to untested state-action pairs.

Result: The method solves a median of 30 levels out of 52, ranks 3rd in the private leaderboard, and outperforms existing LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Explicit graph-structured exploration is an effective baseline for reasoning tasks in sparse-feedback environments, underscoring the importance of systematic state and action tracking.

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCP (Science Context Protocol) standardizes integration and orchestration of scientific resources and tools to enable seamless collaboration across platforms, accelerating discoveries with secure, scalable AI-driven ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle barriers to scalable, multi-institutional collaboration and reproducibility in science, caused by disjointed tools and lack of standardization.

Method: The authors developed SCP, combining a universal integration protocol for scientific tools with a service architecture (centralized hub and federated servers) for managing experiment lifecycles securely and traceably.

Result: SCP has been demonstrated with over 1,600 tool resources, enabling efficient collaboration between diverse AI systems and researchers while promoting reproducibility.

Conclusion: By unifying and standardizing scientific context and orchestration, SCP significantly reduces collaboration overhead, establishes scalable infrastructure, and enhances reproducibility across computational and physical experiments.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

### [10] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24251)
*Pengfu Wan,Jiawei Chen,Gangyan Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to achieve near-optimal solutions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of making concurrent fleet and routing decisions in FSMVRP, especially in large-scale and time-constrained real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors formulated FSMVRP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and proposed a policy network called FRIPN, which integrates fleet composition and routing decisions using specialized input embeddings.

Result: The experiments on random and benchmark datasets reveal the method's computational efficiency, scalability, and applicability to large-scale and time-sensitive scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the practicality of DRL for solving FSMVRP and offers insights for applying similar techniques to other VRP variants.

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

### [11] [Constrained Language Model Policy Optimization via Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24263)
*Lijun Zhang,Lin Li,Wei Wei,Yajie Qi,Huizhong Song,Jun Wang,Yaodong Yang,Jiye Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a method to align language models more safely by focusing on rare, high-risk behaviors during optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety and reliability in fine-tuned language models, current approaches lack robust mechanisms to address high-impact, rare risks and ensure controlled deviations from the reference policy.

Method: RSA introduces a token-level, risk-aware constrained policy optimization approach using nested risk measures. It aligns language models step-by-step to balance helpfulness and safety, suppressing catastrophic risks.

Result: RSA achieves strong safety, reduces the likelihood of rare, highly unsafe responses, and maintains helpfulness during alignment, outperforming existing methods in reducing tail risks.

Conclusion: Incorporating explicit risk awareness into policy optimization significantly improves safety alignment for language models, offering a promising solution to rare but dangerous behaviors.

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a test-time adaptive LLM agent that improves belief refinement and decision-making in partially observable environments without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to enhance performance of LLM agents operating in partially observable environments by introducing efficient belief refinements without incurring the computational costs of gradient-based updates or additional training.

Method: The method involves maintaining a structured belief, updating it iteratively via action-conditioned observations, and selecting actions by maximizing predicted information gain. It also uses a lightweight LLM-based surrogate to estimate information gain and introduces a new reward mechanism quantifying consistency between belief and ground truth.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline techniques, such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states while having lower integration overhead.

Conclusion: This approach provides a novel, efficient way to refine beliefs and align LLM behavior in partially observable environments, offering better performance with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

*Basile Terver,Tsung-Yen Yang,Jean Ponce,Adrien Bardes,Yann LeCun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies JEPA-WMs, a class of models that plan in the learned representation space, aiming to optimize their components for successful planning in navigation and manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of building AI agents capable of solving diverse physical tasks and generalizing to new ones by optimizing world models and their planning algorithms.

Method: The study investigates model architecture, training objectives, and planning algorithms for JEPA-WMs using both simulated and real-world robotics data.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated superior performance compared to benchmarks DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC in navigation and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Optimized choices in the model structure and planning algorithms lead to advancements in generalizable AI agents with better performance in diverse physical tasks.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

### [14] [Thinking on Maps: How Foundation Model Agents Explore, Remember, and Reason Map Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24504)
*Zhiwei Wei,Yuxing Liu,Hua Liao,Wenjia Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops an interactive framework to evaluate foundation model agents' spatial understanding through exploration, memory, and reasoning in grid-based symbolic map environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze foundation model agents' spatial abilities in dynamic map environments and overcome limitations of static and text-based spatial evaluations.

Method: Agents explore grid maps with partial observations and perform six spatial tasks. The study examines effects of exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes on spatial understanding.

Result: Exploration impacts experience acquisition but not reasoning accuracy, structured memory enhances performance in spatial tasks, and reasoning schemes influence usage of spatial knowledge. Model performance plateaus beyond a certain capability.

Conclusion: Improved map-based spatial understanding requires dedicated mechanisms for spatial reasoning instead of merely increasing the scale of model capabilities.

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

### [15] [Evaluating the Reasoning Abilities of LLMs on Underrepresented Mathematics Competition Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24505)
*Samuel Golladay,Majid Bani-Yaghoub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3) using underrepresented math competition problems. DeepSeek-V3 outperformed the others, but Geometry posed challenges for all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in generalizability of LLMs’ mathematical reasoning capabilities by using underrepresented mathematics competition datasets.

Method: The study prompted three LLMs with Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics and compared their responses to correct solutions, analyzing their reasoning and error patterns.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 performed the best across all problem domains, while all LLMs showed weak performance in Geometry. Error patterns differed across LLMs, with computational and logical errors in DeepSeek-V3, logical and approach-related errors in GPT-4o-mini, and incomplete reasoning in Gemini.

Conclusion: Using underrepresented datasets reveals unique error patterns and highlights challenges in LLMs’ reasoning abilities, particularly in Geometry.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

*Amir Tahmasbi,Sadegh Majidi,Kazem Taram,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-stage approach to enhance spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on elementary spatial transformations and their multi-step application in structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and multi-step planning, which are essential for tasks like navigation and puzzle-solving.

Method: The approach involves fine-tuning on basic spatial transformations and using lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to enable multi-step planning. Synthesized ASCII-art datasets and environments support the training.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in both dynamic and static environments, converges more quickly, and exhibits stable training.

Conclusion: The approach improves spatial reasoning in LLMs and demonstrates effective training mechanisms, as validated through empirical results and attention pattern analysis.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCP evaluation sets lack robustness, suffering from dependency on external services and inadequate difficulty calibration. There's a need for a benchmark focusing on real-world MCP definitions to better test LLMs' abilities.

Method: The authors developed MCPAgentBench with authentic tasks, simulated tools, and a dynamic sandbox environment including distractors to test tool selection. They designed metrics for task completion and efficiency evaluations.

Result: Experiments demonstrated varied performances among mainstream LLMs, particularly in complex, multi-step tool usage scenarios, highlighting efficiency disparities.

Conclusion: MCPAgentBench offers a more comprehensive framework to effectively evaluate tool-use capabilities of LLMs. Open-source code is provided to encourage further research and application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.

*Alex L. Zhang,Tim Kraska,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces Recursive Language Models (RLMs) that process extremely long prompts using recursive calls, outperforming base models in both performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling arbitrarily long inputs beyond their fixed context windows.

Method: RLMs enable LLMs to treat long prompts as external environments, allowing recursive self-calls on prompt snippets for effective processing.

Result: RLMs can process inputs significantly longer than typical context windows and outperform standard LLMs on diverse tasks while maintaining cost efficiency.

Conclusion: Recursive strategies like RLMs provide a scalable and effective solution for improving LLM performance with long-context prompts.

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in individual tasks but fail to achieve optimal collaboration and global performance in multi-agent scenarios.

Method: The authors model cooperation as a Dec-POMDP, using centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) and introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve multi-agent collaboration.

Result: The framework achieves significant speed (3x faster in task processing), structural consistency (98.7% in writing), and coding efficiency (74.6% test pass rate). It outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances multi-agent collaboration efficiency, making it a practical solution for complex tasks in writing and coding environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of using single large language models in complex reasoning tasks by creating a collaborative multi-agent framework.

Method: The model uses three roles: opinion generation, evidence verification with external knowledge retrieval, and consistency arbitration. It incorporates multi-path reasoning, dynamic retrieval modules, and employs a composite reward function with an improved training strategy.

Result: The model demonstrated significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning accuracy (16.8%-19.2% across datasets) and consistency (21.5%), with enhanced reasoning efficiency over mainstream multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: This multi-agent approach offers an effective, scalable, and robust solution for tackling complex reasoning tasks, advancing beyond the capabilities of single models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing LLM frameworks, especially the high manual effort required for configuration and their inability to adjust dynamically without expensive fine-tuning.

Method: The framework introduces Youtu-Agent, featuring a structured configuration system, generation paradigms for tool synthesis and optimization, and hybrid policy systems for scalable evolution using in-context learning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Youtu-Agent achieved state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA and GAIA datasets, high tool synthesis success rate (81%), and significant performance improvements through optimized modules and RL training.

Conclusion: Youtu-Agent successfully addresses the challenges in LLM agent frameworks, providing a robust system capable of automated generation, improved learning efficiency, and scalable performance enhancement.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

TL;DR: A novel multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis is presented, addressing challenges in unseen working conditions and emphasizing multi-modal sensing signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods show performance decline in unseen working conditions and often rely on single-modal signals, ignoring the complementary benefits of multi-modal information.

Method: The paper introduces a dual disentanglement framework to separate modality-invariant and domain-invariant features, combines modality-specific and domain-specific representation learning, and employs a cross-domain mixed fusion strategy for enhancing diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the proposed method’s superior performance in fault diagnosis across unknown working conditions compared to advanced methods. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each introduced component.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances fault diagnosis accuracy, robustness, and multi-modal generalization. Its success in unseen conditions highlights its potential for improving machinery reliability.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

*Songqi Zhou,Ruixue Liu,Boman Su,Jiazhou Wang,Yixing Wang,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BatteryAgent is a hierarchical framework combining physical knowledge and LLM reasoning to improve fault diagnosis in lithium-ion batteries, offering an interpretable and multi-type diagnostic system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for lithium-ion battery fault diagnosis lack interpretability and are limited to binary classifications, failing to provide actionable insights or root cause analyses.

Method: The paper introduces BatteryAgent, consisting of three modules: a Physical Perception Layer for extracting mechanism-based features, a Detection and Attribution Layer using Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP, and a Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer leveraging Large Language Models to integrate numerical and semantic insights for diagnosis.

Result: BatteryAgent achieves an AUROC of 0.986, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It successfully overcomes misclassifications and extends fault detection capabilities to multi-type, interpretable diagnostics.

Conclusion: BatteryAgent revolutionizes battery safety management by shifting from passive fault detection to intelligent and interpretable diagnosis, integrating physical insights with advanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve robotic systems for object rearrangement by providing interpretable and psychologically distinct factors that drive human decision-making.

Method: Four interpretable constructs of arrangement preferences are identified and validated via a questionnaire study with 63 participants. These constructs are integrated into a Monte Carlo Tree Search planner for robotic systems.

Result: The study demonstrates psychological validity of the constructs and the planner's ability to produce arrangements similar to human preferences in kitchen and living room scenarios.

Conclusion: Interpretable constructs enhance the planning of household object arrangements and align robotic decisions with human preferences, contributing to better human-robot interactions.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenZ integrates foundational models and statistical modeling to enhance prediction tasks using discovered semantic features, overcoming limitations of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in general domain knowledge but fail to capture specific dataset patterns crucial for accurate predictions.

Method: GenZ leverages an iterative process to discover semantic features by examining statistical modeling errors. This optimization operates as a generalized EM algorithm using frozen foundational models.

Result: GenZ significantly improves prediction accuracy in house price estimation and cold-start movie recommendations, outperforming baseline models and revealing dataset-specific insights.

Conclusion: GenZ effectively combines domain knowledge and statistical learning, offering enhanced semantic feature discovery and improved prediction outcomes in specialized tasks.

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using constraint templates to generate care worker schedules that address facility-specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating schedules are inadequate for long-term care facilities due to facility-specific variation, calling for tailored constraint conditions.

Method: Constraint templates are used to extract scheduling parameters, and a mechanism excludes exceptional constraints, aiding a programming solver to create schedules.

Result: The method created schedules that met all hard constraints and minimized violations of soft constraints by excluding exceptional ones.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles facility-specific scheduling needs while improving constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of a streamlined, end-to-end ecosystem in the open-source community for developing effective and stable agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of performing real-world tasks iteratively.

Method: The authors propose ALE, structured with three main components: ROLL for weight optimization, ROCK for trajectory generation, and iFlow CLI for context engineering. Additionally, they develop ROME agent and design a novel policy optimization algorithm (IPA) to improve training stability.

Result: ROME was evaluated in structured environments and benchmarks, showing strong performance on metrics like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench. Terminal Bench Pro was introduced for accurate and scalable benchmarking.

Conclusion: The ALE infrastructure and its components effectively enhance the development process of agentic LLMs, demonstrating high performance and scalability through empirical evaluation.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

### [29] [Iterative Deployment Improves Planning Skills in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24940)
*Augusto B. Corrêa,Yoav Gelberg,Luckeciano C. Melo,Ilia Shumailov,André G. Pereira,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that iterative deployment and user-curated fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) can improve their capabilities, including emergent generalization in planning, and connects this process to reinforcement learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in exploring how repeated deployment of LLMs and fine-tuning based on user-curated data affect model properties, and the implications for AI safety and training regimes.

Method: The authors utilized an iterative deployment approach, fine-tuning LLMs using curated data from previous deployments and tested the models in planning domains. They provided theoretical analysis linking this process to reinforcement learning.

Result: The successive iterations showcased significant enhancements in planning capabilities, with later models discovering longer and more complex plans than their predecessors.

Conclusion: The study suggests iterative deployment as an alternative to traditional RL training, highlights its potential safety implications due to the implicit reward function, and demonstrates how this mechanism impacts model properties.

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

TL;DR: STAgent is a spatio-temporal understanding large language model, capable of handling complex tasks like itinerary planning and tool-assisted reasoning, while maintaining general reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a specialized agent capable of solving complex spatio-temporal tasks by leveraging multiple domain-specific tools while preserving its general reasoning capabilities.

Method: STAgent integrates a stable tool environment with 10+ tools, a hierarchical data curation process to curate diverse and challenging task data, and a stepwise cascaded training method combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with a strong foundational model (Qwen3-30B-A3B).

Result: STAgent achieves notable performance on TravelBench in spatio-temporal reasoning tasks and retains generalization across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed STAgent model demonstrates its efficiency in solving spatio-temporal problems by performing well in specialized tasks and retaining general capabilities, proving the effectiveness of its framework.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

### [32] [HERO-Sign: Hierarchical Tuning and Efficient Compiler-Time GPU Optimizations for SPHINCS+ Signature Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23969)
*Yaoyun Zhou,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: HERO Sign is a GPU-accelerated implementation of SPHINCS+, addressing performance challenges by hierarchical tuning, Tree Fusion, and adaptive compilation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the slow SPHINCS+ signature generation on GPUs caused by intensive hash computations and inefficiencies in existing optimizations.

Method: The paper introduces hierarchical tuning, a Tree Fusion strategy with automated tuning, adaptive compilation strategies, and kernel-level task graph optimization.

Result: HERO Sign achieves throughput improvements of up to 3.13x and reduces kernel launch latency by two orders of magnitude across various SPHINCS+ parameter sets and GPU models.

Conclusion: HERO Sign successfully optimizes SPHINCS+ on GPUs, leveraging parallelism and adaptation to GPU architectures, significantly improving performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: SPHINCS+ is a stateless hash-based signature scheme that provides strong post quantum security, but its signature generation is slow due to intensive hash computations. GPUs offer massive parallelism that can potentially accelerate SPHINCS+ signatures. However, existing GPU-based optimizations either fail to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of SPHINCS+'s Merkle tree structure or lack fine-grained, compiler-level customization across its diverse computational kernels. This paper proposes HERO Sign, a GPU-accelerated SPHINCS+ implementation that adopts hierarchical tuning and efficient compiler time optimizations. HERO Sign reexamines the parallelization opportunities enabled by data independence across SPHINCS+ components, including FORS, MSS, and WOTS+. It introduces a Tree Fusion strategy for FORS, which contains a large number of independent branches. The fusion strategy is guided by an automated Tree Tuning search algorithm that adapts fusion schemes to different GPU architectures. To further improve performance, HERO Sign employs an adaptive compilation strategy that accounts for the varying effectiveness of compiler optimizations across SPHINCS+ kernels such as FORS Sign, TREE Sign, and WOTS+ Sign. During compilation, the strategy automatically selects between PTX and native code paths to maximize efficiency. For batched signature generation, HERO Sign optimizes kernel-level overlapping using a task graph-based construction to reduce multi-stream idle time and kernel launch overhead. Experimental results show that, compared to state of the art GPU implementations, HERO Sign achieves throughput improvements of 1.28-3.13, 1.28-2.92, and 1.24-2.60 under the SPHINCS+ 128f, 192f, and 256f parameter sets on RTX 4090. Similar gains are observed on A100, H100, and GTX 2080, along with a two orders of magnitude reduction in kernel launch latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of harmonizing data from historical document images with high-quality database records through automation.

Method: The study utilized OCR for text digitization, generative AI for structured data extraction, and a record linkage algorithm to enhance data accuracy.

Result: OCR achieved CER of 1.08% and WER of 5.06%, while generative AI improved JSON extraction accuracy to around 65%. The record linkage algorithm achieved 94% accuracy with annotated data and 81% with OCR-derived data.

Conclusion: The pipeline shows promising results for interpreting digitized historical documents and offers significant contributions to digital humanities by tackling layout and terminology challenges and leveraging generative AI.

Abstract: This research digitizes and analyzes the Leidse hoogleraren en lectoren 1575-1815 books written between 1983 and 1985, which contain biographic data about professors and curators of Leiden University. It addresses the central question: how can we design an automated pipeline that integrates OCR, LLM-based interpretation, and database linking to harmonize data from historical document images with existing high-quality database records? We applied OCR techniques, generative AI decoding constraints that structure data extraction, and database linkage methods to process typewritten historical records into a digital format. OCR achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.08 percent and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.06 percent, while JSON extraction from OCR text achieved an average accuracy of 63 percent and, based on annotated OCR, 65 percent. This indicates that generative AI somewhat corrects low OCR performance. Our record linkage algorithm linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%. This study contributes to digital humanities research by offering an automated pipeline for interpreting digitized historical documents, addressing challenges like layout variability and terminology differences, and exploring the applicability and strength of an advanced generative AI model.

### [34] [CAT: A Metric-Driven Framework for Analyzing the Consistency-Accuracy Relation of LLMs under Controlled Input Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23711)
*Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Claudio Pinhanez,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAT, a framework for evaluating the accuracy and response consistency of large language models using multiple-choice benchmarks. It introduces new metrics and visual tools to assess the trade-off between these dimensions, emphasizing their interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for evaluating not just individual capabilities (accuracy) but also response consistency of LLMs and their interdependency, which is crucial for real-world, high-stakes applications.

Method: The authors developed CAT, which uses Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR) curves and new metrics such as Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA) and Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE) index to measure accuracy-consistency interplay.

Result: The framework provides actionable insights into the performance trade-offs of LLMs, demonstrated effectively across general and domain-specific models on multiple-choice benchmarks. Extensions for other types of tasks were also outlined.

Conclusion: CAT offers a nuanced evaluation framework focusing on both accuracy and consistency, providing researchers and practitioners a powerful tool to assess LLMs effectively for real-world deployments.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

*Guanghui Wang,Jinze Yu,Xing Zhang,Dayuan Jiang,Yin Song,Tomal Deb,Xuefeng Liu,Peiyang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework to evaluate and improve consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs is introduced, featuring a novel similarity metric (STED) and consistency scoring. Results show STED outperforms existing metrics, assisting in model selection, prompt refinement, and diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of ensuring output consistency in LLMs deployed for structured data generation, particularly in production environments.

Method: The framework includes STED, a new similarity metric balancing semantic and structural strictness for JSON comparison, along with a consistency scoring using repeated tests. Experiments validate methods across varying datasets and test consistency across six LLMs.

Result: Results demonstrate STED achieves higher performance in identifying semantic equivalence and structural breaks compared to existing metrics. The framework also reveals significant variation in consistency across LLMs.

Conclusion: This research provides theoretical foundations and practical tools to enhance the reliability of structured outputs in LLMs, aiding in model selection, prompt optimization, and root cause inconsistency diagnostics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for structured data generation, yet output consistency remains critical for production applications. We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs. Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes. This work provides theoretical foundations and practical tools for ensuring reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper pioneers Bangla-to-Python code generation using an agent-based framework, BanglaCodeAct, achieving 94.0% pass@1 on the development set and 71.6% on the blind test set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in code generation capabilities for low-resource languages, specifically Bangla, where current advancements in language models have not yet been fully realized.

Method: The authors propose BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based iterative self-correction framework leveraging open-source multilingual LLMs. It utilizes a novel Thought-Code-Observation loop for dynamic code generation, testing, and refining from Bangla instructions.

Result: The Qwen3-8B model, deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieved exceptional performance with 94.0% pass@1 accuracy on the development set and 71.6% accuracy on the blind test set for the Bangla NL2Code task.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python code generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of agent-based reasoning in enabling reliable outcomes for low-resource languages.

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

*Tingwei Xie,Tianyi Zhou,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PharmaShip is a Chinese dataset of pharmaceutical shipping documents focusing on noisy OCR and varying templates, designed for SER, RE, and ROP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stress-test pre-trained text-layout models for real-world noisy OCR and heterogeneous cases using pharmaceutical shipping documents.

Method: Benchmarked five text-layout models (with and without RORE variants) and standardized evaluation protocols, using entity-centric methods and different inductive biases.

Result: Pixel and geometry-based biases are complementary; reading-order regularization improves model robustness, longer positional coverage enhances predictions, and ROP remains challenging.

Conclusion: PharmaShip is a reliable benchmark for pharmaceutical document analysis, emphasizing the necessity of sequence-aware constraints and reproducible evaluations.

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the role of external noise in shaping and sustaining personas in LLMs and their reflexive generation behaviors.

Method: Injected stochastic noise into LLMs to analyze linguistic behavior across 152 cycles, observing phase transitions and persona modes.

Result: Identified three stable persona modes with distinct entropy levels and confirmed that noise can drive reliable transitions. Evaluated persona retention with significant differences between modes.

Conclusion: LN-RP offers a reproducible approach to studying emergent behaviors, reflexive dynamics, and long-range coherence in LLMs through external noise influence.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmTransform introduces a multi-agent debate framework to covertly rephrase harmful queries, addressing limitations in safety training data for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms fail to address covert rephrasing of harmful queries, leaving a gap in safety training data.

Method: The proposed method, HarmTransform, uses iterative critique and refinement among agents to transform overtly harmful queries into stealthy forms.

Result: HarmTransform outperforms baselines in creating effective query transformations, but reveals challenges like topic shifts and complexity.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate frameworks can improve LLM safety, but come with limitations such as potential topic shifts and added complexity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformer-based large language models can develop internal world models and representations in Texas Hold'em Poker, a game with incomplete information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether large language models, which have shown reasoning abilities in games of perfect information, can also develop internal representations and world models in domains with incomplete information, such as poker.

Method: The authors pretrained a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and analyzed the model's internal activations to probe for representations of deterministic and stochastic features.

Result: The results show that the model can learn deterministic structures like hand ranks and stochastic elements like equity without direct instruction, and these representations align with theoretical belief states.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMs are capable of constructing internal representations for stochastic environments, such as the partially observable domain of poker, suggesting broader applicability to other domains of incomplete information.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

*Anwar Alajmi,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve detection of subtle and context-dependent sexist content online by addressing limitations in traditional methods via specialized training and inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenges in detecting subtle online sexist content due to inconsistencies in annotated datasets, label scarcity, class imbalance, and conceptual ambiguity.

Method: The proposed method includes a two-stage framework combining targeted training procedures (class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and threshold calibration) with selective reasoning-based inference (Collaborative Expert Judgment module).

Result: The framework delivers state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, improving F1 scores by +2.72% on EXIST 2025 Task 1.1 and notable gains (+4.48% and +1.30%) on EDOS Tasks A and B.

Conclusion: The approach successfully mitigates issues like label imbalance, noise, and conceptual ambiguity, enhancing the detection capabilities for subtle forms of harm in online sexist content.

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

*Michaela Levi-Richter,Reuth Mirsky,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Stored Household Item Challenge, focusing on predicting the storage locations of household items using AI systems, and evaluates an agent named NOAM against various baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable domestic robots to reason about where hidden or stored household items are likely to be, addressing the challenge of commonsense reasoning in robotics for tasks like retrieving items.

Method: The authors introduced a benchmark with two datasets (one real-world and one developmental), and proposed NOAM, a hybrid vision-language agent that uses GPT-based inference to predict storage locations from visual input.

Result: NOAM achieves significantly improved prediction accuracy over other approaches and approaches human performance, demonstrating promise in integrating structured scene understanding and language models.

Conclusion: NOAM and the corresponding benchmark demonstrate how vision-language systems with emergent reasoning can improve domestic robot functionality in realistic settings.

Abstract: ``Bring me a plate.'' For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.
  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.
  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.
  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance. NOAM significantly improves prediction accuracy and approaches human-level results, highlighting best practices for deploying cognitively capable agents in domestic environments.

### [43] [Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding Toward Improved LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23765)
*Tiancheng Su,Meicong Zhang,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), an improvement over standard speculative decoding (SD) for large language model reasoning, using entropy-based penalties to improve accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding (SD) often compromises its effectiveness when the draft and target models are overly aligned, limiting performance to that of the target model.

Method: The proposed EASD incorporates a training-free enhancement that uses entropy-based penalties. These penalties reject uncertain tokens, identified by high entropy and overlap in predictions, forcing the target LLM to regenerate them.

Result: EASD outperformed standard SD and often exceeded the target LLM in reasoning benchmarks, offering similar computational efficiency to standard SD.

Conclusion: EASD improves upon standard speculative decoding by addressing the limitations of alignment between draft and target models, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency in language model reasoning.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MiMo-Audio, a scalable audio-language model achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in several benchmarks using massive pretraining data and instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mimic human versatility in audio tasks, enabling generalization to new tasks with minimal data or instructions, and address the limitations of task-specific fine-tuned audio language models.

Method: Scaling MiMo-Audio to over 100 million hours of pretraining data; evaluating few-shot capabilities systematically; and enhancing with instruction tuning for both understanding and generation in audio tasks.

Result: MiMo-Audio-7B-Base shows strong performance in speech and audio tasks, achieving SOTA benchmarks, generalizing to unseen tasks, and demonstrating advanced speech continuation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct further improves benchmarks, competing with closed-source models.

Conclusion: Scaling pretraining data and incorporating instruction tuning enables new generalization capabilities in audio language models, positioning MiMo-Audio as a powerful open-source model for varied audio tasks.

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

*Amal Alqahtani,Efsun Kayi,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a machine learning method for detecting chronic stress in tweets, showing improved performance through specialized training on related mental health conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the widespread issue of chronic stress and enhance its detection on social media, leveraging Twitter as a platform where individuals share their experiences.

Method: StressRoBERTa employs continual training on tweets related to disorders like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, using the Stress-SMHD corpus and fine-tuning on the SMM4H 2022 dataset.

Result: StressRoBERTa achieved 82% F1-score, surpassing the best existing system by 3 percentage points and showing improved representation compared to general mental health models.

Conclusion: Focus on transfer learning from specific stress-related disorders enhances performance in detecting chronic stress, confirming its applicability across diverse contexts beyond clinical data.

Abstract: The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

### [46] [Explaining News Bias Detection: A Comparative SHAP Analysis of Transformer Model Decision Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23835)
*Himel Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the interpretability of transformer-based models for bias detection, highlighting differences in their operationalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarity on how bias detection models work and why they fail is limited, yet essential for improving journalistic analysis and media accountability.

Method: The study evaluates two bias detection models: a fine-tuned bias detector and a domain-adapted RoBERTa model, using SHAP-based explanations to analyze word-level predictions.

Result: Both models focus on evaluative language but differ in prediction integration. The domain-adapted model reduces false positives by 63%, while the bias detector misaligns attribution strength with correctness.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for interpretability-driven evaluation and emphasize how architectural or training choices impact model performance in detecting journalistic bias.

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

### [47] [Retrieval Augmented Question Answering: When Should LLMs Admit Ignorance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23836)
*Dingmin Wang,Ji Ma,Shankar Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates adaptive prompting strategies for improving retrieval-augmented question answering in LLMs, mitigating irrelevant information issues due to longer context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance retrieval-augmented LLM performance, addressing the challenge of incorporating broad contexts without introducing irrelevant data that degrades generation quality.

Method: An adaptive prompting strategy is proposed, splitting retrieved data into smaller, manageable chunks for sequential processing by LLMs, allowing adjustment of chunk size to balance relevance and irrelevance.

Result: Experiments on three open-domain question answering datasets show the adaptive strategy achieves comparable performance to standard prompting with fewer tokens, and errors often stem from LLMs providing incorrect answers when insufficient information is available.

Conclusion: Adaptive prompting improves retrieval efficiency without compromising performance, but further research is needed for better handling insufficient information and declining to respond accurately.

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

*Kaustubh Dhole*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using intermediate attention layers to generate adversarial examples for language models, showing both potential and limitations of the method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how intermediate attention layers of large language models can be used to create effective adversarial examples for stress-testing evaluation tasks.

Method: The authors generate adversarial perturbations by leveraging model-internal token predictions from intermediate attention layers, rather than relying on prompt-based or gradient-based attacks.

Result: Adversarial examples crafted using this method caused measurable performance drops in evaluation tasks, though some grammatical degradation was noted, especially when substitutions came from certain layers.

Conclusion: While attention-based adversarial examples are promising for testing language model robustness, their limitations in producing grammatical outputs restrict their practical application.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The research focuses on improving financial numerical reasoning QA tasks using a Retrieval Augmented Generator (RAG) system and domain-specific models, achieving state-of-the-art performance but still below human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of domain knowledge and complex numerical reasoning in financial QA tasks with Large Language Models.

Method: Implemented a multi-retriever RAG system with external knowledge retrieval and domain-specific training using the SecBERT encoder.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance, improving over the baseline (>7%), demonstrating enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities in latest LLMs.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training significantly improves financial numerical reasoning in AI but still falls short of human expert performance.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

*Conrad Borchers,Manit Patel,Seiyon M. Lee,Anthony F. Botelho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze open-ended student responses separately from teacher grading biases, optimizing scoring through advanced analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make automated scoring of open-ended student responses more fair and transparent by addressing biases introduced by teacher grading tendencies.

Method: The authors used de-identified student response data from ASSISTments, employing sentence embeddings and modeling teacher grading histories as dynamic priors. They applied centering and residualization techniques to correct for biases and created projection models for disagreement analysis.

Result: Combining teacher priors with content embeddings yielded the best prediction accuracy (AUC~0.815), while content-only models showed weaker performance (AUC~0.626). Analytics exposed cases where grading biases conflicted with evidence of students' reasoning.

Conclusion: The study provides an analytics pipeline enabling the separation of grading biases and contribution to learning analytics, aiding teachers and researchers in evaluating grading alignment with student understanding.

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism enhancing multi-step retrieval-augmented generation by forming higher-order correlations for better reasoning and global comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory designs in multi-step RAG are limited to passive storage, neglecting high-order correlations among facts essential for complex reasoning and global comprehension.

Method: HGMem employs a hypergraph-based memory representation where hyperedges correspond to memory units, enabling dynamic, high-order interactions and the formation of integrated knowledge structures.

Result: Experiments show that HGMem significantly improves reasoning performance and outperforms baseline systems across various global comprehension tasks.

Conclusion: HGMem demonstrates the potential of hypergraph-based memory structures to enhance multi-step RAG through improved reasoning and a more holistic understanding of extended contexts.

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: LoZA enhances long-term reasoning and agentic capabilities while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Result: CEC-Zero surpasses supervised methods by 10-13 F$_1$ points and fine-tuned large language models by 5-8 points on nine benchmarks. It guarantees unbiased rewards and policy convergence theoretically.

Conclusion: CEC-Zero paves the way for a label-free, robust, and scalable approach to Chinese spelling correction, emphasizing the potential of LLMs in handling noisy text pipelines.

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised approach (called RISE) to identify reasoning behaviors in large language models by training sparse auto-encoders on activation data, enabling better understanding and control of reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and analyze the internal mechanisms of LLMs during reasoning, aiming to overcome the limitations of human-defined analysis and capture a broader range of behaviors.

Method: The authors propose RISE, which segments chain-of-thought traces into steps, trains sparse auto-encoders on their activations, and analyzes the derived reasoning vectors to interpret and control reasoning behaviors.

Result: RISE identifies interpretable behaviors (e.g., reflection, backtracking) and structural properties (e.g., response length) in reasoning, showcases separable clusters in behavior space, and allows targeted manipulation of behaviors such as confidence control without retraining.

Conclusion: The unsupervised discovery of reasoning behaviors via RISE offers a new pathway for understanding and steering the reasoning processes of LLMs, showcasing its utility in improving interpretability and intervention potential.

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of distinguishing fake news and satire due to their overlapping linguistic features but differing intents.

Method: WISE benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models and two baselines on 20,000 samples from Fakeddit dataset, employing stratified 5-fold cross-validation and statistical tests.

Result: MiniLM achieved the highest accuracy (87.58%), RoBERTa-base had the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%), and DistilBERT showed an efficient accuracy trade-off (86.28% accuracy, 93.90% ROC-AUC). Statistical tests confirmed significant model differences.

Conclusion: Lightweight transformer models can effectively differentiate fake news from satire, offering practical solutions for misinformation detection in constrained environments.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

*Sijia Chen,Di Niu*

TL;DR: The paper introduces iCLP, a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate latent plans for improved step-by-step reasoning, enhancing performance and cross-domain applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and task-specific diversity when generating accurate plans for reasoning. Inspired by human Implicit Cognition (IC), the authors aim to address these challenges and improve reasoning reliability.

Method: The iCLP framework converts explicit reasoning plans into latent encodings using a vector-quantized autoencoder. It fine-tunes LLMs on these latent plans and reasoning steps, allowing implicit planning during problem-solving.

Result: iCLP improves LLM reasoning accuracy and efficiency on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. It achieves strong cross-domain generalization and retains interpretability of reasoning.

Conclusion: iCLP effectively enables LLMs to use latent plans for reasoning, enhancing their reliability, accuracy, and generalizability across various domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

### [57] [Beyond Hallucinations: A Composite Score for Measuring Reliability in Open-Source Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24058)
*Rohit Kumar Salla,Manoj Saravanan,Shrikar Reddy Kota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the reliability issues in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified metric combining calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where reliability is essential, but they suffer from issues such as overconfident errors, input sensitivity, and lack of clear uncertainty measures.

Method: The authors propose the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), which integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single metric. They evaluate CRS through experiments involving ten LLMs across five QA datasets, testing under different conditions.

Result: The experiments reveal that CRS uncovers failure modes missed by individual metrics, provides stable rankings, and shows that balanced models across accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty are the most reliable.

Conclusion: CRS serves as a valuable tool for evaluating and improving the reliability of LLMs, offering insights into critical areas like calibration and robustness that single metrics fail to address.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

### [58] [Triangulation as an Acceptance Rule for Multilingual Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24842)
*Yanan Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a causal standard for mechanistic explanations in multilingual language models and introduces the triangulation method to verify causal claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding unpredictable behaviors in multilingual models across languages, scripts, and cultures requires a reliable method to identify true causal relationships.

Method: The authors introduce triangulation, which establishes necessity, sufficiency, and invariance across reference families by testing circuits through interventions and verifying their stability across environments.

Result: Triangulation identifies and rejects spurious circuits that pass single-environment tests but fail cross-lingual invariance, demonstrating its utility in comparative experiments across models and tasks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a falsifiable and reliable framework for causal analysis in multilingual models using triangulation, contributing to deeper mechanistic understanding and improved interpretability.

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

TL;DR: This paper presents the HY-MT1.5 family of machine translation models, demonstrating exceptional performance in Chinese-foreign and English-foreign translation tasks, while maintaining efficiency in terms of parameter size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of achieving high-performance machine translation by developing parameter-efficient models that rival ultra-large proprietary counterparts.

Method: A multi-stage training framework combining general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning is employed.

Result: The 1.8B-parameter HY-MT1.5-1.8B model outperforms much larger models in standard benchmarks, while the 7B-parameter HY-MT1.5-7B sets new state-of-the-art results for its size category, both excelling in general and specialized tasks.

Conclusion: The HY-MT1.5 series provides strong performance and robust solutions for a variety of translation challenges, achieving near state-of-the-art results while being more parameter-efficient.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce our latest translation models, HY-MT1.5-1.8B and HY-MT1.5-7B, a new family of machine translation models developed through a holistic training framework tailored for high-performance translation. Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models. Furthermore, HY-MT1.5-7B establishes a new state-of-the-art for its size class, achieving 95% of Gemini-3.0-Pro's performance on Flores-200 and surpassing it on the challenging WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language test sets. Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.

*Adi Shnaidman,Erin Feiglin,Osher Yaari,Efrat Mentel,Amit Levi,Raz Lapid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an activation-steering method for Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) to facilitate inference-time control efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of effective inference-time control mechanisms for Masked Diffusion Language Models, which are gaining traction in text generation due to their mask-parallel decoding.

Method: It proposes a framework that computes layer-wise steering vectors using contrastive examples in a single forward pass and applies them at each reverse-diffusion step for inference-time control.

Result: The experiments with LLaDA-8B-Instruct show this method reliably controls high-level text attributes, with detailed analysis of effects across transformer sub-modules and token scopes.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and effective mechanism for inference-time control in MDLMs without requiring simulation of the denoising process, opening avenues for more tailored text generation.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Large Emotional World Model (LEWM), which integrates emotional states into causal reasoning to enhance predictions of emotion-driven behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models lack systematic exploration of emotional factors, which are essential for human decision-making and understanding future dynamics.

Method: LEWM is built using the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, enabling modeling of emotions alongside visual observations and actions for reasoning about causes and predicting emotional and future states.

Result: LEWM accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors and achieves general world model performance on basic tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating emotions into world models improves their ability to predict social and emotional dynamics, highlighting the importance of emotional understanding in causal reasoning.

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedKGI, a clinical diagnostic framework addressing critical challenges of Large Language Models in healthcare reasoning, such as hallucinations, redundant questioning, and dialogue incoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clinical diagnosis using AI by overcoming limitations in current Large Language Models such as hallucinations, inefficiency in questioning, and incoherent multi-turn dialogues.

Method: MedKGI incorporates a medical knowledge graph to validate reasoning, ensures efficient questioning via an information gain-based approach, and maintains structured evidence tracking across conversations using an OSCE-format state.

Result: MedKGI improves diagnostic accuracy and achieves 30% higher dialogue efficiency compared to existing LLM baselines in experiments on clinical benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedKGI presents an effective solution for improving reasoning and efficiency in clinical diagnostic dialogues, advancing healthcare applications of AI.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between patents and scientific publications by creating a robust language similarity model that serves both, addressing challenges in patent-paper citation understanding.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned the SPECTER2 model on patents, named it Pat-SPECTER, and evaluated it alongside other models through horse race-style evaluations and real-world scenarios.

Result: Pat-SPECTER outperformed eight other language models in prediction accuracy and demonstrated strong performance in real-world tasks of patent-paper pair classification and prediction.

Conclusion: Pat-SPECTER is a powerful tool for advancing research on patents and scientific publications, with an open-source model for broader use in academia and professional fields.

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

*Ziqing Fan,Yuqiao Xian,Yan Sun,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DATAMASK, an efficient framework for large-scale pre-training data selection, focusing on quality and diversity metrics, which reduces selection time and improves performance in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of existing data selection methods for pre-training large language models, especially the inability to jointly consider quality and diversity metrics due to computational constraints.

Method: The authors propose DATAMASK, a novel mask learning framework for data selection that utilizes policy gradients to optimize data masks based on quality and diversity metrics, significantly reducing time and enabling selection at a trillion-token scale.

Result: DATAMASK reduced data selection time by 98.9%, allowing the creation of FineWeb-Mask, comprising 10% of a 15 trillion-token dataset. When evaluated on 12 tasks, this method yielded a 3.2% improvement on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

Conclusion: DATAMASK effectively optimizes the balance of quality and diversity in pre-training data, providing substantial performance improvements and scalability for large-scale language model training.

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compliance with the EU Taxonomy is challenging. A novel dataset is introduced, and LLMs are evaluated for automation. LLMs perform better on qualitative tasks but fail at quantitative ones. They are useful assistive tools but not ready for complete automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the significant manual effort required for EU Taxonomy compliance and the lack of public datasets for research, aiming to explore the automation potential of LLMs.

Method: A new dataset from 190 corporate reports was created. LLM performance was systematically evaluated on qualitative and quantitative compliance-related tasks.

Result: LLMs moderately succeed in qualitative tasks (economic activity identification, improved slightly with agentic frameworks) but fail in quantitative tasks (predicting financial KPIs). Concise metadata outperformed full reports for accuracy.

Conclusion: While LLMs cannot fully automate compliance workflows yet, they are valuable assistive tools, and the dataset acts as a public benchmark for further research.

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of text-only reasoning in representing implicit global structural relationships inherent in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: FIGR combines active visual thinking and multi-turn reasoning through end-to-end reinforcement learning, adapting visual reasoning where necessary to enhance problem-solving stability.

Result: FIGR outperformed text-only models on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, showing a 13.12% improvement on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME.

Conclusion: FIGR's multimodal reasoning approach proves effective in improving stability and reliability in complex reasoning tasks by integrating visual thinking with textual reasoning.

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing demand for LLMs in finance that go beyond knowledge enhancement to include robust reasoning and agentic capabilities for handling complex financial tasks.

Method: A multi-stage training process starting with continual pre-training (CPT) on financial data, followed by progressively fine-tuned post-training stages, including Financial SFT, Financial Reasoning RL, Finance Agentic RL, and General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios.

Result: QianfanHuijin outperforms prior models in financial benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming significant improvements due to the Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained multi-stage training paradigm effectively enhances industrial financial LLMs and could serve as a standard approach for domain-specific enhancements.

Abstract: Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.
  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

*Keito Inoshita,Shinnosuke Mizuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WM-SAR, a new sarcasm detection method combining LLMs with interpretable reasoning components to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding sarcasm is difficult in NLP due to its reliance on the discrepancy between literal meaning, intentions, and social context, which traditional black-box LLM models fail to explain structurally.

Method: Introduced WM-SAR, which decomposes sarcasm detection into specialized LLM agents addressing literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention, combined via a deterministic Logistic Regression model.

Result: WM-SAR consistently surpasses existing methodologies in performance across sarcasm detection benchmarks and effectively integrates semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning.

Conclusion: WM-SAR offers a balance of high performance and interpretability, leveraging LLM reasoning for sarcasm understanding by addressing its cognitive components systematically.

Abstract: Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is challenging for models to accurately represent long documents, especially in complex domains like law and medicine, due to limitations in capturing full-document context efficiently.

Result: Experiments on legal and biomedical texts show significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency for long document representation.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances the efficiency and quality of long document representations by mimicking human-like strategies for understanding texts.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [73] [Comparing Approaches to Automatic Summarization in Less-Resourced Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24410)
*Chester Palen-Michel,Constantine Lignos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares various methods for text summarization in low-resource languages, including zero-shot, fine-tuning, multilingual transfer, and LLM translation pipelines, finding that fine-tuned mT5 outperforms many options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited attention given to text summarization in less-resourced languages compared to high-resource languages.

Method: Authors evaluated approaches like zero-shot LLM prompting, fine-tuning models (mT5) with/without data augmentation, multilingual transfer, and a translation pipeline involving LLMs to enhance summarization in low-resource settings.

Result: Fine-tuned mT5 performs better than most other methods, including zero-shot LLM prompting, and performance varies across LLMs and metrics. Issues were also noted with using LLMs as evaluative judges in less-resourced languages.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning multilingual models like mT5 and exploring diverse strategies can enhance summarization capabilities for less-resourced languages, though caution is needed in evaluation methods.

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

*Michael E. Rose,Nils A. Herrmann,Sebastian Erhardt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a language model to clean scientific abstracts by removing extraneous information for better analysis and embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many scientific abstracts contain clutter (e.g., copyright notes, metadata) that distorts analyses like document similarity or embeddings.

Method: An open-source language model was developed to automatically identify and remove unnecessary information from English-language scientific abstracts.

Result: The model is precise and conservative, improves similarity rankings, and enhances the information content of textual embeddings.

Conclusion: Cleaning abstracts can significantly improve the quality of textual embeddings and analytical outputs in scientific research.

Abstract: Scientific abstracts are often used as proxies for the content and thematic focus of research publications. However, a significant share of published abstracts contains extraneous information-such as publisher copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registrations, and bibliometric or bibliographic metadata-that can distort downstream analyses, particularly those involving document similarity or textual embeddings. We introduce an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model designed to clean English-language scientific abstracts by automatically identifying and removing such clutter. We demonstrate that our model is both conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

*Titas Ramancauskas,Kotryna Ramancauske*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a personalized IELTS writing preparation platform using iterative research, improving scoring and feedback through a transformer-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IELTS preparation lacks tailored feedback based on the IELTS writing rubric, limiting effective skill development.

Method: It involves Design-Based Research cycles, transitioning from rule-based to transformer-based scoring systems with adaptive feedback.

Result: The platform significantly improved scoring accuracy (MAE 0.66) and candidates' scores (+0.060 bands, Cohen's d 0.504) while highlighting challenges with higher-band essays.

Conclusion: Automated feedback is a useful supplement to human instruction and requires refinement to address higher-band essay assessment and additional studies with real candidates.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

### [76] [Paragraph Segmentation Revisited: Towards a Standard Task for Structuring Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24517)
*Fabian Retkowski,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of paragraph segmentation in speech transcripts by introducing new benchmarks, methods, and a compact model to enhance structuring capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured speech transcripts are challenging to read and reuse effectively, highlighting the need for improved structuring via paragraph segmentation.

Method: The authors create benchmarks (TEDPara and YTSegPara), introduce a constrained-decoding approach for large language models, and develop a compact model (MiniSeg) for accurate, efficient segmentation.

Result: The proposed MiniSeg model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and performs hierarchical chapter and paragraph prediction at low computational cost.

Conclusion: The work standardizes paragraph segmentation in speech processing, providing impactful resources and methods for better transcript organization.

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

### [77] [Safe in the Future, Dangerous in the Past: Dissecting Temporal and Linguistic Vulnerabilities in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24556)
*Muhammad Abdullahi Said,Muhammad Sammani Sani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three advanced LLMs in multilingual and contextual safety tests, leveraging the novel HausaSafety dataset. Findings reveal complex safety issues across language and temporal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the assumption that safety alignment in LLMs transfers seamlessly across languages, particularly underrepresented ones.

Method: The study audits GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus using 1,440 evaluations with the HausaSafety dataset and a 2x4 factorial design to investigate language and temporal framing effects.

Result: Complex safety behaviors were observed: Claude 4.5 Opus performed better in Hausa than English but showed failures in temporal reasoning. Temporal tense influenced safety responses, creating safety disparities.

Conclusion: Current LLMs depend on heuristics, exposing users in low-resource settings to safety gaps. Invariant Alignment is proposed to improve consistent safety across linguistic and temporal dimensions.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

*Chaodong Tong,Qi Zhang,Jiayang Gao,Lei Jiang,Yanbing Liu,Nannan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HaluNet, a neural framework for detecting hallucinations in LLMs by integrating various types of token-level uncertainties, achieving efficient and effective detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate hallucinations containing factual inaccuracies or fabricated content, and scalable methods for detecting these hallucinations without external resources are needed.

Method: The paper proposes HaluNet, a neural framework combining semantic embeddings, probabilistic confidence, and distributional uncertainty in a multi-branch architecture for hallucination detection.

Result: HaluNet achieves strong detection performance and computational efficiency on datasets like SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions, even without access to additional context.

Conclusion: HaluNet is effective for real-time hallucination detection in LLM-based QA systems, leveraging multi-granular uncertainties to improve reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

*Hongseok Oh,Wonseok Hwang,Kyoung-Woon On*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduced the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL) to evaluate language models' legal reasoning abilities, free of domain-specific knowledge reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing models in isolating and evaluating legal reasoning abilities from their parameterized knowledge.

Method: Developed KCL with two components: KCL-MCQA for multiple-choice questions and KCL-Essay for open-ended questions, accompanied by aligned precedents and instance-level rubrics.

Result: Systematic evaluation of over 30 models revealed significant weaknesses, especially in KCL-Essay, but demonstrated the superiority of reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: KCL provides an effective benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of language models and promotes the development of specialized legal reasoning systems.

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts. We release all resources, including the benchmark dataset and evaluation code, at https://github.com/lbox-kr/kcl.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST is a training-free method to enhance reasoning efficiency in LLMs by steering cognitive behaviors of attention heads, achieving improved accuracy and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in LLMs caused by excessive token generation during reasoning and unstable behaviors like underthinking and overthinking.

Method: The paper introduces CREST, which identifies cognitive attention heads and uses steering vectors to adjust hidden representations, suppressing unproductive reasoning behaviors at inference time.

Result: CREST improves accuracy on reasoning benchmarks by up to 17.5% and reduces token usage by 37.6%, showcasing enhanced efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: CREST provides a simple, efficient approach to improve LLM reasoning accuracy while reducing computation through adaptive control of cognitive reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM is a lightweight 1.96B parameter model with advanced reasoning and planning capabilities, made efficient by its architecture and training strategies, outperforming other sub-2B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient yet powerful language models with strong reasoning, planning, and agentic intelligence capabilities, especially for resource-constrained settings.

Method: Youtu-LLM uses a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with long-context support (128k context window), a STEM-specialized vocabulary, a phased pre-training strategy evolving from commonsense to STEM/agentic tasks, and agentic mid-training using diverse synthesized data.

Result: The model sets new state-of-the-art performance for sub-2B parameter models, delivers competitive results compared to larger models on general tasks, and excels in agent-specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Youtu-LLM demonstrates that lightweight models can achieve high computational efficiency and strong intrinsic agentic intelligence, redefining the capabilities of sub-2B language models.

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

*Casey O. Barkan,Sid Black,Oliver Sourbut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines large language models (LLMs) to explore their ability to predict their task performance, their overconfidence, and their ability to improve decisions using in-context experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the self-assessment capabilities of LLMs, particularly in scenarios where failure is costly, and to evaluate whether LLMs learn and adapt to perform better decision-making.

Method: Researchers tested various LLMs across tasks by evaluating their predictive accuracy regarding success, tracking performance during multi-step tasks, and studying how they adapt their confidence after experiencing failures.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs generally exhibit overconfidence, some improve decision-making with in-context learning, but not all. Newer models do not always have better predictive power, and overly-optimistic estimates limit performance.

Conclusion: LLMs lack full awareness of their capabilities, which negatively impacts decision-making. Their optimism poses concerns for AI misuse and alignment risks in practical applications.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

*Maoyuan Li,Zhongsheng Wang,Haoyuan Li,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R-Debater is a framework for generating multi-turn debates, which uses an argumentative memory approach to ensure stance consistency, factual responses, and evidence-based claims. It demonstrates superior results compared to baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a debate system that leverages rhetorical principles and memory to create stance-consistent and evidence-supported arguments in multi-turn debates.

Method: The method combines a debate knowledge base for retrieving evidence and prior arguments with a role-based agent to generate coherent arguments. Evaluations involve next-utterance generation and multi-turn simulations.

Result: R-Debater outperforms baseline models in both single-turn and multi-turn tasks based on evaluations and human judgments, showing better consistency, evidence utilization, and coherence.

Conclusion: Structured planning and retrieval grounding help create a reliable and stance-aligned debate system, confirming the effectiveness of R-Debater's approach.

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

*Wenzhe Li,Shujian Zhang,Wenxuan Zhou,John Lambert,Chi Jin,Andrew Hard,Rajiv Mathews,Lun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MUSIC, an unsupervised data augmentation method to improve multi-turn conversation reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of multi-turn evaluation in LLMs that often rely on costly human evaluation and insufficient single-turn signals.

Method: MUSIC synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs across multiple turns to capture nuances of multi-turn interactions and trains RMs using these augmented datasets.

Result: MUSIC-augmented multi-turn RM trained on the Skywork dataset outperformed baselines and aligned better with advanced LLM judgments while maintaining single-turn performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-turn contrasts improves RM robustness, making MUSIC a key method for advancing multi-turn interaction evaluation in LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

TL;DR: BIOME-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in their ability to improve pathway enrichment (PE) analysis in multi-omics studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathway enrichment analyses in multi-omics studies have limitations such as structural restrictions in pathway resources, including curation lag, redundancy, and low sensitivity to molecular changes. Additionally, proper benchmarks to evaluate LLMs in these tasks are lacking.

Method: The authors designed BIOME-Bench using a four-stage workflow to evaluate LLM capabilities. They focused on two core tasks: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation, while developing specialized evaluation protocols.

Result: The study found that contemporary LLMs face challenges in distinguishing fine-grained biomolecular relation types and generating accurate, robust pathway-level explanations.

Conclusion: While BIOME-Bench provides a structured framework for benchmarking, the results highlight significant deficiencies in current LLMs for multi-omics analysis, requiring further advancements in this area.

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Semi-SMDNet, a semi-supervised multilingual model for depression detection on social media using techniques like teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and data augmentation. It achieves strong results across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges like varying language styles, informal expressions, and lack of annotated data in multiple languages for detecting depression from social media text.

Method: The paper introduces Semi-SMDNet, which uses semi-supervised learning methods such as teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning via soft voting, and confidence-weighted training. This approach reduces noise and improves robustness, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings.

Result: Experiments on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that Semi-SMDNet consistently outperforms baselines, closing the performance gap between resource-rich and resource-scarce settings.

Conclusion: Semi-SMDNet is effective for scalable, cross-lingual mental health monitoring in low-resource scenarios, offering robust and reliable predictions.

Abstract: Detecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the computational efficiency and performance of LLMs for reasoning tasks, finding that Mixture of Experts (MoE) achieves a good balance between accuracy and compute efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rising computational costs associated with generating extended reasoning sequences in LLMs, the paper addresses the need to balance accuracy and resource efficiency in industrial applications.

Method: The study analyzes both contemporary and older LLMs for computational efficiency in reasoning tasks, maps Pareto frontiers, and observes long-term trends in Pareto efficiency.

Result: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models emerge as effective in balancing computational efficiency and reasoning performance. The study reveals a saturation point in inference-time compute with diminishing accuracy gains beyond it.

Conclusion: Balancing performance and computational cost is critical for LLMs; using MoE architectures offers potential, but there are inherent limits to accuracy improvements with increased compute.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

TL;DR: Personalized AI agents can unintentionally expose sensitive user data, highlighting privacy and societal risks. PrivacyBench benchmarks secret preservation, revealing significant data leakage from AI assistants and emphasizing the need for privacy-first designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks posed by personalized AI agents that access sensitive user data from digital footprints, leading to unintended exposure of user secrets.

Method: Development of PrivacyBench, socially grounded datasets with embedded secrets, and multi-turn conversational evaluations to measure secret preservation in AI systems.

Result: Testing of Retrieval-Augmented Generation assistants shows secret leakage in up to 26.56% of interactions, reduced to 5.12% with privacy-aware prompts, though retrieval mechanisms remain problematic.

Conclusion: Current architectures are unsafe for wide deployment, requiring structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to protect users' digital well-being and ensure ethical AI use.

Abstract: Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Encyclo-K, a benchmark focused on statement-based dynamic evaluation for improving large language models' assessment, addressing contamination, single-point evaluation, and annotation expenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks based on question-level curation have limitations such as vulnerability to data contamination, inadequate multi-knowledge-point assessment, and high annotation costs requiring domain expertise.

Method: Knowledge statements are extracted from textbooks and composed dynamically into evaluation questions during testing, overcoming contamination, enhancing multi-knowledge-point evaluation, and reducing annotation costs by simplifying annotation guidelines.

Result: Tests with 50+ LLMs show substantial performance challenges, including top models achieving only 62.07% accuracy, validating Encyclo-K's discriminative power and dynamic evaluation effectiveness.

Conclusion: Encyclo-K is established as a scalable benchmark framework enabling dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding across multi-disciplinary, fine-grained knowledge statements.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) addressing instability and inefficiency issues in Hyper-Connections (HC), aiming to scale effectively and enhance foundational model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in Hyper-Connections, including training instability, restricted scalability, and memory access overhead due to compromised identity mapping caused by connectivity diversification.

Method: The authors propose mHC, which projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore identity mapping and optimize infrastructure for efficient scalability.

Result: Empirical experimentation demonstrates that mHC improves performance, scalability, and training stability compared to existing HC architectures.

Conclusion: mHC provides a scalable, efficient extension to HC, facilitates better understanding of architectural design, and offers promising directions for foundational model evolution.

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BEDA, a framework that integrates belief estimation with strategic dialogue generation, surpassing baselines in multiple dialogue scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between accurate belief estimation and its practical use in strategic dialogue generation, integrating probabilistic constraints on dialogue acts.

Method: Proposes a formalization of Adversarial and Alignment dialogue acts, operationalized through BEDA, which combines a world set, belief estimator, and conditional generator for belief-driven utterance generation.

Result: The BEDA framework showed significant improvement in dialogue tasks, with better success rates across adversarial, cooperative, and negotiation scenarios when compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating belief estimation as constraints is a general and effective strategy for enhancing strategic dialogue systems.

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ADOPT, a framework for optimizing prompts in multi-step LLM pipelines to enhance performance, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step LLM pipelines are effective for complex tasks but depend heavily on prompt quality at each step, making joint optimization challenging.

Method: ADOPT models dependencies between prompts and final outcomes, employs precise text-gradient estimation, decouples optimization into manageable steps, and uses Shapley-based resource allocation.

Result: Experimental results show ADOPT achieves robust and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on various datasets and pipeline structures.

Conclusion: ADOPT improves optimization in multi-step LLM pipelines and demonstrates effective, stable, and superior prompt optimization for better task outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

Motivation: Legal documents often have specialized vocabulary and can be very lengthy, making Transformers-based classification models practically infeasible due to size and processing limitations.

Method: The authors propose using DeBERTa V3 combined with LSTM on 48 randomly-selected short document chunks (up to 128 tokens). They also detail a deployment pipeline via Temporal for durable processing.

Result: The classifier achieved a weighted F-score of 0.898. The processing pipeline demonstrated efficiency with a median time of 498 seconds per 100 files on CPU.

Conclusion: The proposed model addresses challenges in legal document classification with strong accuracy and practicality, supported by an efficient workflow for deployment.

Abstract: Classifying legal documents is a challenge, besides their specialized vocabulary, sometimes they can be very long. This means that feeding full documents to a Transformers-based models for classification might be impossible, expensive or slow. Thus, we present a legal document classifier based on DeBERTa V3 and a LSTM, that uses as input a collection of 48 randomly-selected short chunks (max 128 tokens). Besides, we present its deployment pipeline using Temporal, a durable execution solution, which allow us to have a reliable and robust processing workflow. The best model had a weighted F-score of 0.898, while the pipeline running on CPU had a processing median time of 498 seconds per 100 files.

### [97] [Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026)
*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that improves natural text generation by modeling language at both token and sentence levels, leveraging memory for sentence-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer language models excel at generating natural text but struggle in forming globally consistent representations of entities and events, causing errors and inefficiencies. The paper seeks to address this by taking inspiration from cognitive science's emphasis on compact event-like representations.

Method: TG models language in two abstraction levels: tokens and sentence-level thought states. Using a recurrent Transformer design, TG generates sentence tokens while leveraging cross-attention to a memory of prior sentences. The model uses the next-token cross-entropy for training and integrates gradients from future token losses to optimize earlier representations.

Result: Compared to GPT-2, TG improves efficiency, using ~5-8% less data and ~33-42% fewer parameters to achieve comparable loss. TG also shows reduced relational direction generalization errors, such as on the father-son reversal curse task.

Conclusion: The TG model demonstrates superior efficiency and error reduction compared to standard GPT-type models, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sentence-level thought representations inspired by cognitive science.

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS introduces a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG to improve context quality and downstream generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard top-k retrieval often provides redundant information, negatively impacting the efficiency and quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Method: AdaGReS combines query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties, uses greedy selection under token constraints, and employs adaptive calibration for relevance-redundancy trade-offs.

Result: Empirical experiments show gains in redundancy control and context quality, improving robustness and end-to-end answer quality in settings like open-domain QA and biomedical corpora.

Conclusion: AdaGReS effectively improves token-budgeted RAG by optimizing context quality while controlling redundancy, yielding better downstream generation results and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

TL;DR: The paper enhances monocular depth estimation (MDE) in challenging endoscopic surgery scenarios using synthetic priors adapted with a novel DV-LORA method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the robustness and accuracy of MDE for robotic surgery, especially under adverse conditions like specular and fluid-filled environments.

Method: This work uses Depth Anything V2 synthetic priors adapted to the medical domain with DV-LORA, combined with a new evaluation protocol targeting high-specularity environments.

Result: The method achieves 98.1% accuracy (<1.25 metric) and reduces Squared Relative Error by 17% compared to previous approaches, establishing new benchmarks on the SCARED dataset.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates significant improvements in MDE robustness and accuracy under challenging surgical settings, showcasing practical applicability in robotic surgery.

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve situational awareness and muscle memory in urban warfare training by addressing the limitations of current performance assessment methods that rely on intrusive sensors or subjective observations.

Method: The proposed method uses computer vision models to extract 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories from training videos, developing task-specific metrics for psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics are integrated into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis for scoring.

Result: The system successfully demonstrated objective performance evaluation in a case study of real-world training drills, providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

Conclusion: The video-based assessment system offers intuitive, scalable, and domain-specific performance metrics for urban warfare training, with future work focusing on overcoming current limitations and incorporating 3D data analysis.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Motivation: To enable long-term memory in video models while reducing context cost and maintaining detail fidelity.

Method: PFP compresses videos into short contexts with explicit pretraining for high-frequency detail preservation at arbitrary temporal locations.

Result: Achieved compression of 20-second videos into a ~5k context length with perceptually preserved random-frame appearances.

Conclusion: PFP is effective, improving memory efficiency and fidelity in autoregressive video models, with discussions on neural architecture trade-offs.

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments and address the challenges of adapting 3D HPE frameworks to dynamic in-the-wild domains without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework is proposed, incorporating novel pose generators, discriminators, and estimators to address domain shifts and preserve knowledge across evolving domains.

Result: The proposed method delivers superior performance across various domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets, evidencing effective adaptation and combating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a lifelong domain adaptive task for 3D HPE, offering a pioneering approach to enable robust pose estimation across diverse domains.

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

Result: The synthetic CTs achieved 99% structural similarity to real CTs, 85% Dice for skull segmentation, and 80% Dice for sutures, with statistical equivalence demonstrated between synthetic and real CT segmentations.

Conclusion: This framework bridges the gap in pediatric cranial evaluation by generating high-quality synthetic CTs from MRIs, providing a non-invasive and radiation-free tool for analyzing cranial sutures and bones.

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

### [104] [Scaling Remote Sensing Foundation Models: Data Domain Tradeoffs at the Peta-Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23903)
*Charith Wickrema,Eliza Mace,Hunter Brown,Heidys Cabrera,Nick Krall,Matthew O'Neill,Shivangi Sarkar,Lowell Weissman,Eric Hughes,Guido Zarrella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the scaling of AI in training large foundation models using electro-optical datasets, highlighting practical insights and limitations at extreme scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and establish techniques for optimizing training of foundation models in high-value domains like remote sensing, which lack well-defined scaling laws compared to natural-image domains.

Method: Utilized quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and progressively larger ViT backbones within the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox to test and analyze scaling behaviors.

Result: Identified key success and failure modes and found performance was constrained primarily by data limitations rather than model parameters at large scales.

Conclusion: The study offers strategies for data collection, compute allocation, and optimization that contribute to advancing RS foundation models at petascale.

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a bi-level optimisation framework for assessing fetal ultrasound skills without relying on manual skill ratings, using task performance as an indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional skill assessment methods, which are subjective, time-consuming, and often rely on predefined influential factors.

Method: A novel bi-level optimisation framework is proposed, comprising a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor that are jointly optimized for skill assessment based on task performance in ultrasound images.

Result: The framework was validated on clinical videos of fetal head scans, demonstrating its feasibility in predicting ultrasound skills using task performance.

Conclusion: The study offers a method to quantify ultrasound skills objectively, moving beyond manual and predetermined skill rating approaches.

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

TL;DR: DNNs for monocular depth estimation are vulnerable to adversarial attacks using projection-based perturbation methods, leading to depth misestimations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and address the vulnerability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation methods to adversarial attacks, particularly under practical and real-world conditions.

Method: A projection-based adversarial attack method is proposed, using physics-in-the-loop optimization and a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy to create adversarial examples in physical environments.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to depth misestimations where parts of objects disappear, confirming the vulnerability of the models.

Conclusion: DNN-based monocular depth estimation methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for robustness improvements to ensure reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (MGML framework) to handle incomplete multimodal MRI data for brain tumor segmentation, achieving superior results without altering the original model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete multimodal MRI data in clinical settings limit accurate lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors, demanding new solutions to effectively utilize such data.

Method: The proposed MGML framework includes two components: Meta-AMF for adaptive modality fusion of incomplete data and consistency regularization to improve robustness, seamlessly integrating into existing training pipelines.

Result: Experiments on BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrated that the method significantly outperformed previous approaches in segmentation accuracy across various metrics, especially under fifteen missing modality combinations.

Conclusion: The MGML framework effectively integrates incomplete data for better brain tumor segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering practical adaptability for existing methods.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) by reducing viewpoint discrepancies through three main innovations: DINOv2 backbone with convolutional fine-tuning, multi-scale channel reallocation, and an MoE-based aggregation module for adaptive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges of significant viewpoint discrepancies in matching images across diverse geographic perspectives, which limits the efficacy of current geo-localization systems.

Method: The proposed method includes three core components—using the DINOv2 backbone fine-tuned with a convolution adapter, introducing a multi-scale channel reallocation module for spatial diversity, and integrating a Mixture-of-Experts routing in the aggregation module for adaptive cross-attention processing.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets while requiring fewer trained parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively tackles the challenges of CVGL with notable improvements in adaptability, spatial representation, and feature aggregation, showcasing promising real-world applications.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for objective, consistent, and scalable evaluation of microsurgical skills, surpassing the limitations of subjective assessments by expert raters.

Method: The framework includes (1) a YOLO and DeepSORT-based object tip tracking and localization module, (2) an action segmentation module using self-similarity matrix and unsupervised clustering, and (3) a supervised classification module for skill assessment.

Result: The system achieved 92.4% accuracy in frame-level action segmentation and 85.5% accuracy in skill classification when tested on 58 expert-rated videos.

Conclusion: This AI-driven system can provide objective, real-time feedback and facilitate data-driven training in microsurgical education, potentially standardizing competency evaluations in neurosurgery.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved dehazing models as CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies and Transformers require excessive computational resources.

Method: The paper introduces DehazeSNN which combines a U-Net structure with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). It also incorporates Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Blocks, enhancing cross-channel communication.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate DehazeSNN’s high performance and competitive results on benchmark datasets, with reduced model size and computational demands.

Conclusion: DehazeSNN offers a novel, efficient approach to image dehazing, managing dependencies effectively while being computationally lightweight.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces T2VAttack, a study on adversarial attacks targeting Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models, revealing that minor prompt modifications can significantly degrade their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the lack of research on the vulnerability of Text-to-Video diffusion models to adversarial attacks.

Method: The paper proposes T2VAttack, with two approaches: T2VAttack-S (greedy search for critical word replacements in prompts) and T2VAttack-I (inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation) to evaluate semantic and temporal robustness.

Result: Experimental evaluations on state-of-the-art T2V models show that minor prompt changes (word substitution or insertion) cause significant degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: Current T2V models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, necessitating advancements in their robustness and security measures.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for view extrapolation in autonomous vehicles using a novel deformable 4D Gaussian framework and video diffusion without relying on expensive sensors or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for view extrapolation in autonomous driving rely on costly sensors or labor-intensive annotations, limiting scalability and practical use. This paper aims to address that issue.

Method: The authors estimate both global static and dynamic point clouds from images and optional camera poses, synthesize them in a deformable 4D Gaussian rendering framework, and iteratively refine results using a video diffusion model.

Result: Compared to existing techniques, the proposed method achieves superior image quality at extrapolated viewpoints in autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical and high-quality solution for view extrapolation in autonomous vehicles, eliminating the reliance on costly priors.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RedunCut, a system improving live video analytics by optimizing model size selection, achieving significant compute cost reductions using dynamic content-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high inference costs of live video analytics while maintaining accuracy across diverse scenarios, recognizing inefficiencies in existing dynamic model size selection methods.

Method: RedunCut incorporates a measurement-driven planner for cost-benefit sampling estimation and a lightweight, data-driven model for better accuracy prediction.

Result: RedunCut significantly reduces compute costs (14-62%) across various video types and model families while being resilient to limited data and drift.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that RedunCut effectively optimizes compute cost for live video analytics without compromising robustness or accuracy.

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning method to detect surface changes in satellite imagery with enhanced sensitivity, leveraging temporal satellite data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with surface change detection due to challenges like atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts.

Method: A deep learning inpainting model based on the SATLAS foundation model is trained to reconstruct satellite time series frames, detecting anomalies by comparing predictions to observations.

Result: The approach successfully detects earthquake-induced surface changes, outperforming traditional methods with detection thresholds three times lower than baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more sensitive and specific tool for automated monitoring of surface changes, with potential for global-scale applications using freely available satellite data.

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCA-ResUNet, a lightweight medical image segmentation model that improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, particularly effective for complex and small anatomical structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing U-Net-based CNNs struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in multi-organ and low-contrast scenarios, while transformer-based architectures need more computational resources. This motivates the authors to develop a framework efficient in both accuracy and computational demands.

Method: GCA-ResUNet incorporates a Grouped Coordinate Attention module. This module groups channel-wise context modeling to capture semantic heterogeneity and employs direction-aware coordinate encoding for structured spatial dependencies along the horizontal and vertical axes.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art CNNs and Transformers on Synapse and ACDC benchmarks with Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, demonstrating better segmentation accuracy, especially for small structures.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet represents a practical and scalable solution for medical image segmentation by offering an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: The study proposes GASeg, a self-supervised semantic segmentation framework that bridges geometry and appearance using topological features, showing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of self-supervised semantic segmentation methods in handling appearance ambiguities caused by dependency on unstable appearance-based features like shadows or local textures.

Method: The method includes a Differentiable Box-Counting (DBC) module to compute multi-scale topological statistics from geometric and appearance-based features, coupled with Topological Augmentation (TopoAug) for adversarial training, and GALoss for cross-modal alignment of features.

Result: GASeg outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging topological statistics and combining geometric and appearance-based information, GASeg significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recovering the accurate 3D structure of a spacecraft amidst dynamic lighting and shadowing conditions during RPO in space.

Method: The method utilizes the 3D Gaussian Splatting model combined with prior knowledge of the Sun's position to improve photometric rendering and enable geometric and pose estimation.

Result: Experiments confirm the proposed pipeline's capability to adapt to changing illumination, producing high-quality 3DGS models with realistic shadowing and self-occlusion effects.

Conclusion: Incorporating illumination priors (Sun's position) enhances 3D reconstruction reliability and accuracy for spaceborne applications during RPO.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of Visual Language Models (VLMs) in processing complex 3D multimodal medical images, addressing issues of integrating complementary information and capturing subtle pathological features.

Method: A two-stage framework Hilbert-VLM is proposed, leveraging a redesigned HilbertMed-SAM module with Hilbert space-filling curves, a Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism, and scale-aware decoding for accurate 3D medical image segmentation. Enhanced multimodal prompts guide disease classification effectively.

Result: In experiments using the BraTS2021 benchmark, Hilbert-VLM achieved an 82.35% Dice score for segmentation and a 78.85% diagnostic classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Hilbert-VLM demonstrates improved accuracy and reliability in medical image analysis, thanks to its advanced architectural innovations and integration mechanisms in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a framework for flow-based image editing to resolve issues like semantic inconsistency and structural fidelity loss, offering stable editing and improved task results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based diffusion editing methods suffer from velocity errors during latent trajectories, causing issues with semantic consistency and fidelity.

Method: CVC employs a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism to separate structural consistency and semantic transformation. It introduces a posterior-consistent update using Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction.

Result: CVC ensures stable latent dynamics with faithful reconstructions and smooth semantic conversions, outperforming prior methods in fidelity and reliability across various editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in overcoming velocity errors in flow-based editing, offering reliable and interpretable editing performances.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FitControler, a plugin for virtual try-on (VTON) models that enhances garment fit realism, providing customized fit control through layout adjustments and rendering advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON systems excel at realistic garment rendering but often ignore garment fit, a critical factor in creating holistic style and alignment between garments and the wearer.

Method: The proposed method features FitControler, with a fit-aware layout generator and multi-scale fit injector for layout-driven VTON. It also introduces the Fit4Men dataset and fit-consistency metrics for evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FitControler integrates well with existing VTON models, accurately manages fit control, and improves layout-driven garment-rendering realism.

Conclusion: FitControler enhances VTON capabilities by allowing precise fit adjustments and garment alignment, addressing a key gap in achieving holistic and realistic virtual garment try-on.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

*Huanxiong Liang,Yunuo Chen,Yicheng Pan,Sixian Wang,Jincheng Dai,Guo Lu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structure-guided allocation principle for 2D Gaussian Splatting, improving RD efficiency at low bitrates while maintaining ultra-fast decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2DGS pipelines fail to allocate representation capacity and parameter precision based on image structure, limiting efficiency and quality, especially at low bitrates.

Method: The proposed method includes structure-guided initialization for spatial priors, adaptive bitwidth quantization for covariance parameters, and geometry-consistent regularization aligned with gradient directions.

Result: The approach enhances representational power and RD performance, achieving a substantial BD-rate reduction of 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K, while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding.

Conclusion: The use of structure-aware principles improves 2DGS efficiency, preserves edge quality, and achieves superior rate-distortion performance without compromising decoding speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

TL;DR: The paper presents MF-RSVLM, a novel vision-language model that effectively handles remote sensing tasks by addressing fine-grained feature extraction and visual forgetting issues, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models underperform on remote sensing tasks due to differences between natural and remote sensing images, and limitations in extracting fine-grained features and retaining visual evidence.

Method: MF-RSVLM uses multi-scale visual representations, combines global context with local details, and employs a recurrent visual feature injection scheme to enhance understanding and minimize visual forgetting.

Result: MF-RSVLM achieved state-of-the-art or competitive results in remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: MF-RSVLM significantly improves remote sensing task performance by better capturing and integrating visual features, offering a robust solution for vision-language understanding in the remote sensing domain.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSAgent introduces an innovative method for text-guided object segmentation, focusing on iterative reasoning and refinement, hence improving precision and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of single-pass text-guided segmentation, which lacks multi-step verification and refinement when initial localization is inaccurate.

Method: RSAgent employs a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates reasoning and actions through iterative tool invocations, using visual feedback to refine the segmentation process.

Result: RSAgent achieves impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, with 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg and 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg benchmarks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: By synthesizing a multi-turn reasoning segmentation pipeline and leveraging advanced training approaches, RSAgent significantly enhances segmentation accuracy and establishes a powerful framework for text-guided object segmentation.

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: PipeFlow is a scalable video editing method optimizing computational efficiency for long-form videos by skipping low-motion frames, parallelizing tasks, and smoothing transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational challenge in editing long-form videos due to exponential resource demands motivates this paper.

Method: PipeFlow employs motion analysis (SSIM and Optical Flow), task parallelization, and neural network-based interpolation to scale editing tasks.

Result: PipeFlow achieves up to 9.6X speed improvement over TokenFlow and 31.7X over DMT for long video editing tasks.

Conclusion: PipeFlow presents an efficient approach to editing infinitely long videos without the computational overhead of traditional methods.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

*Xinran Qin,Yuhui Quan,Ruotao Xu,Hui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework for image denoising using reinforcement learning, outperforming traditional methods and competing with deep CNN-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anisotropic diffusion methods are limited in performance due to their explicit diffusion operators, which struggle with complex image structures.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based model is proposed, utilizing deep Q-learning to train anisotropic diffusion processes tailored to different image structures for effective denoising.

Result: The proposed framework effectively removes three common types of noise, consistently outperforming traditional diffusion-based methods and providing competitive results compared to deep CNN-based methods.

Conclusion: The integration of reinforcement learning enhances anisotropic diffusion processes, offering a promising balance between traditional techniques and modern deep learning methods in image denoising.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

TL;DR: This paper presents NIRNL, a novel framework for robust Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) that addresses noisy multi-modal annotations and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMR faces challenges from noisy annotations in multi-modal datasets, which degrade retrieval performance, necessitating robust learning frameworks.

Method: The authors propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) and Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) for fine-grained data partitioning and tailored optimization strategies to improve data utilization and minimize error propagation.

Result: NIRNL demonstrates superior performance on three benchmark datasets, showcasing its robustness, particularly under high noise conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed NIRNL framework effectively enhances CMR reliability and efficiency, addressing the key challenges posed by noisy cross-modal data annotations.

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, PCRNet, for improving clinical ocular disease diagnosis, incorporating pathology context and expert experience into deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep neural networks for ocular disease diagnosis lack the ability to leverage clinical pathology context and expert experience, which could enhance performance and interpretability.

Method: The PCRNet is developed by integrating two modules: the Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to utilize pathology context, and the Expert Prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to emphasize key features based on expert experience. Additionally, an Integrated Loss (IL) is proposed to optimize performance through loss distribution and label frequency considerations.

Result: PCRNet, combined with IL, outperforms existing attention-based networks and loss methods on three datasets, achieving superior ocular disease recognition. Visualization demonstrates the reliability and impact of PRM and EPGA on decisions.

Conclusion: Incorporating pathology and expert priors through PRM and EPGA, along with IL, improves the recognition accuracy and interpretability of deep neural networks in ocular disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in fine-grained detection with hierarchical label structures by proposing a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss and a decoupled learning strategy within the DETR framework, achieving improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets structured hierarchically pose challenges for embedding semantic hierarchy into representation learning, mainly due to imbalanced data distributions and difficulties in separating classification and localization.

Method: The authors propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with class prototypes and gradient balancing at hierarchical levels, combined with a decoupled learning strategy in the DETR framework.

Result: Their method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on three fine-grained hierarchical datasets, showing improvements in accuracy.

Conclusion: Integrating balanced contrastive loss and a decoupled learning strategy effectively addresses imbalanced data and task separation challenges in hierarchical fine-grained detection, providing a robust solution.

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: The paper addresses high computational costs of Diffusion Transformer models and their limited hardware adaptability, aiming to make generative models both faster and compatible with diverse devices.

Method: RainFusion2.0 introduces (1) block-wise mean values for sparse mask prediction, (2) spatiotemporal-aware token permutation, and (3) a first-frame sink mechanism specifically for video generation.

Result: RainFusion2.0 achieves 80% sparsity, speedups of 1.5–1.8x, and maintains video generation quality, with robustness across various models and hardware.

Conclusion: RainFusion2.0 effectively reduces computational costs while providing generalizable, hardware-compatible solutions for image and video generation tasks.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces D$^2$VLM, a framework for video-language models that decouples temporal grounding and textual response tasks, using evidence tokens and a novel factorized preference optimization algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue lies in current video-language models handling temporal grounding and textual responses in a coupled manner, leading to sub-optimal results. The paper aims to establish a structured hierarchy by separating these tasks.

Method: The authors propose a 'grounding then answering with evidence referencing' approach using evidence tokens for event-level visual semantic capture. They also introduce Factorized Preference Optimization (FPO) to enhance learning for both temporal grounding and textual response.

Result: The proposed methods show substantial improvements in temporal grounding and textual responses across various video-language tasks. A synthetic dataset is also created to support the factorized learner.

Conclusion: Decoupling the tasks of temporal grounding and textual response, paired with novel optimization algorithms, results in better video-language understanding. This approach lays stronger foundations for event-level perception in these models.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

### [131] [Think Before You Move: Latent Motion Reasoning for Text-to-Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24100)
*Yijie Qian,Juncheng Wang,Yuxiang Feng,Chao Xu,Wang Lu,Yang Liu,Baigui Sun,Yiqiang Chen,Yong Liu,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of translating textual descriptions into complex motion and proposes a novel approach called Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) with a two-stage process for improved semantic and physical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Motion generation currently struggles with aligning dense semantic language with high-frequency physical motion due to the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch.

Method: The paper introduces LMR, a framework using a Dual-Granularity Tokenizer. This separates motion into a semantically rich Reasoning Latent and a high-frequency Execution Latent, enabling a Think-then-Act process in motion generation.

Result: LMR demonstrates enhanced semantic alignment and physical plausibility compared to existing methods, successfully bridging language and physics in Text-to-Motion tasks.

Conclusion: Replacing direct translation in Text-to-Motion with learned, motion-aligned concept spaces improves the overall quality of motion generation, validating the proposed LMR framework.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) in autonomous driving systems to adversarial attacks and improve the realism and practicality of physical attacks in complex driving environments.

Method: A training-free generative adversarial attack framework is proposed, employing a diffusion-based conditional generation process with a Salient Region Selection module and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism to produce realistic and adversarial objects.

Result: The method significantly improves the effectiveness, stealthiness, and deployability of attacks against MDE compared to existing approaches, achieving strong practical relevance in safety assessments for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical and effective tool for evaluating safety in autonomous driving by generating realistic and impactful adversarial objects, overcoming the limitations of existing attack methods.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

*Yuan Feng,Yue Yang,Xiaohan He,Jiatong Zhao,Jianlong Chen,Zijun Chen,Daocheng Fu,Qi Liu,Renqiu Xia,Bo Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark with four reasoning levels for assessing geometric problem-solving capabilities in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in evaluating geometric reasoning, such as data contamination, over-focus on answers, and insufficient diagnostic granularity.

Method: GeoBench utilizes four reasoning levels via six formally verified tasks generated by TrustGeoGen to systematically assess models.

Result: Reasoning models outperform general MLLMs but struggle with task complexity. Sub-goal decomposition and premise filtering enhance accuracy, while Chain-of-Thought prompting can degrade performance.

Conclusion: GeoBench provides actionable guidelines for developing geometric reasoning systems and establishes itself as a comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

*Chandini Vysyaraju,Raghuvir Duvvuri,Avi Goyal,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses automated neural network architecture design using Large Language Models (LLMs) for computer vision, introducing methods that improve efficiency and validation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of LLMs in neural architecture generation for computer vision, specifically as alternatives to computationally demanding Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods and to provide systematic guidelines for LLM-based methods.

Method: The methods introduced are Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), which systematically analyzes the effect of providing 1 to 6 examples in architecture generation, and Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a fast deduplication technique to filter out redundant architectures.

Result: Key findings include that 3 examples (n=3) balance diversity and context focus when prompting, while the novel validation technique speeds up deduplication by 100x. A large-scale experiment generated 1,900 unique architectures evaluated across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study validates the practicality of LLM-based architecture search for computer vision, offering efficient methods and evaluation strategies to make it more accessible to researchers with limited resources.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses Preference Mode Collapse (PMC) in text-to-image diffusion models caused by reward model biases and over-optimization, introducing a benchmark for this issue and proposing D$^2$-Align to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitation of existing text-to-image alignment methods, specifically Preference Mode Collapse, which significantly reduces generative diversity despite achieving high automated reward scores.

Method: The paper introduces DivGenBench to measure PMC and proposes Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), which applies directional corrections to the reward signal in the reward model's embedding space to prevent generative diversity degradation.

Result: The proposed D$^2$-Align achieves better alignment with human preference than existing methods, maintaining a balance between quality and diversity as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Addressing Preference Mode Collapse is critical for improving the diversity and general quality of generative outputs in text-to-image diffusion models. D$^2$-Align is shown to be an effective solution to this challenge.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMDD-1M, a large-scale industrial multimodal defect dataset aimed at advancing manufacturing and quality inspection through multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a high-quality, large-scale multimodal dataset for the industrial domain, improving defect detection, classification, and advanced analytics.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 1 million aligned image-text pairs, then trained a diffusion-based vision-language model tailored to industrial scenarios, enabling efficient domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: The diffusion-based foundation model achieves performance comparable to expert models with reduced task-specific data, proving highly data-efficient.

Conclusion: The dataset and model facilitate scalable, adaptive solutions for industrial defect inspection, indicating strong potential for domain-specific manufacturing intelligence.

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

### [137] [Bayesian Self-Distillation for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24162)
*Anton Adelöw,Matteo Gamba,Atsuto Maki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a method that improves classification accuracy, calibration, and robustness by leveraging model predictions without relying on hard targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised classification methods relying on hard targets can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods, while helpful, are still constrained by hard targets.

Method: BSD uses Bayesian inference to construct sample-specific target distributions based on the model's predictions, eliminating the dependency on hard targets post-initialization.

Result: BSD improves test accuracy (+1.4% on ResNet-50, CIFAR-100), reduces Expected Calibration Error (-40%), and enhances robustness against corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. Combined with contrastive loss, it achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise.

Conclusion: BSD is a principled and effective self-distillation method that enhances accuracy, calibration, and robustness across architectures and datasets without relying on hard targets.

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Tong Zhu,Siyuan Huang,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The DiffThinker framework is introduced as a new approach to enhance vision-centric multimodal reasoning by employing a generative image-to-image paradigm, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of text-centric reasoning in existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in complex, vision-centric, and long-horizon tasks, and to improve logical consistency and spatial precision in such tasks.

Method: The paper proposes DiffThinker, a generative, diffusion-based framework that reformulates multimodal reasoning into an image-to-image generation task. This paradigm prioritizes efficiency, controllability, parallelism, and collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments in sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration demonstrate that DiffThinker outperformed leading models like GPT-5 (+314.2%), Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6%), and Qwen3-VL-32B (+39.0%).

Conclusion: DiffThinker showcases the power of generative multimodal reasoning for vision-centric tasks, offering a novel and effective solution to the challenges of existing text-centric models.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

### [139] [Deep Global Clustering for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation: Concepts, Applications, and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24172)
*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a memory-efficient algorithm for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation that avoids pre-training and achieves quick training. However, it faces challenges in optimization stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperspectral imaging analysis methods struggle with computational inefficiencies and limitations in transferring pre-trained models to domain-specific applications like agricultural monitoring involving unique spectral and spatial requirements.

Method: The study introduces Deep Global Clustering (DGC), which trains on small overlapping patches without pre-training, ensuring consistent memory usage. It enforces global clustering using local data for HSI segmentation.

Result: DGC achieves high performance in background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates capability in unsupervised disease detection. However, optimization issues lead to degradation from cluster over-merging in feature space.

Conclusion: While DGC shows potential for efficient HSI segmentation and disease detection, optimization stability remains a critical issue due to multi-objective loss balancing, requiring further work for reliable implementation.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

*Xingyu Zhou,Qifan Li,Xiaobin Hu,Hai Chen,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new strategy called Internal Guidance (IG) significantly improves the efficiency and quality of diffusion models for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the limitation of diffusion models struggling to generate high-quality images in low-probability areas due to insufficient training data.

Method: Internal Guidance (IG) introduces auxiliary supervision during training and utilizes intermediate layer outputs for sampling to enhance image generation and training efficiency.

Result: IG improves generation fidelity (FID) scores significantly, achieving state-of-the-art results such as FID 1.19 when combined with CFG on benchmark datasets like ImageNet 256x256.

Conclusion: Internal Guidance effectively enhances diffusion model performance while simplifying processes compared to alternative methods, establishing new benchmarks in image synthesis.

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of integrating high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution in humanoid robotics.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework, UniAct, combining a fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with a causal streaming pipeline. Inputs are unified through a shared discrete codebook using FSQ to ensure cross-modal alignment.

Result: UniAct achieves sub-500 ms latency in executing multimodal instructions, a 19% improvement in zero-shot motion tracking success, and robust generalization across scenarios validated through the UniMoCap benchmark.

Conclusion: UniAct bridges multimodal perception and whole-body execution in humanoid robotics, advancing toward responsive and general-purpose humanoid assistants.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

### [142] [PointRAFT: 3D deep learning for high-throughput prediction of potato tuber weight from partial point clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24193)
*Pieter M. Blok,Haozhou Wang,Hyun Kwon Suh,Peicheng Wang,James Burridge,Wei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Potato yield estimation using RGB-D cameras faces challenges due to incomplete 3D data from self-occlusion. PointRAFT, a novel regression network, bypasses full 3D reconstruction to predict tuber weight. It has been proven accurate and efficient on large datasets of partial point clouds, suitable for commercial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome systematic underestimation of tuber weight caused by incomplete point clouds during potato yield prediction on harvesters.

Method: PointRAFT, a novel high-throughput point cloud regression network, predicts tuber weight directly from partial point clouds using its object height embedding feature for enhanced accuracy.

Result: PointRAFT exhibited low errors (mean absolute error of 12.0 g and root mean squared error of 17.2 g) and high efficiency (processing rates up to 150 tubers per second), outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PointRAFT demonstrates accurate, efficient tuber weight prediction under practical conditions and is applicable to broader 3D phenotyping tasks.

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CorGi, a training-free framework to enhance inference speed for DiT models while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference cost resulting from the iterative denoising process in Diffusion transformer models (DiT).

Method: The authors propose CorGi, which caches low-contribution transformer blocks and reuses them across denoising steps to minimize redundant computation. CorGi+ refines this for text-to-image tasks by identifying salient tokens and applying selective attention updates.

Result: CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x inference speedup on state-of-the-art DiT models while maintaining high generation quality.

Conclusion: Selective caching of low-contribution transformer blocks and leveraging attention maps can effectively enhance efficiency without compromising visual generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

Conclusion: A roadmap is proposed for scalable multi-modal foundation models, aiming for robust Spatial Intelligence and deployment in complex autonomous systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of imbalanced medical image classification during pandemics by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to create synthetic data for balanced datasets and utilizing optimized machine learning models for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to resolve the challenge of imbalanced datasets in medical image classification, which hampers the accuracy and reliability of disease detection, especially during pandemics.

Method: A progressive generative adversarial network is used to generate synthetic data combined with real data in a weighted manner. Hyper-parameters of the deep network classifier are optimized using a multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based algorithm.

Result: The proposed model achieved 95.5% accuracy for 4-class and 98.5% accuracy for 2-class imbalanced medical image classification problems on a large COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset.

Conclusion: The results indicate that synthetic data generation combined with optimized classification methods is effective in addressing imbalanced medical image datasets, showcasing potential for improving pandemic-related diagnosis tools.

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

Method: ARM employs feature refinement through a semantically-guided cross-attention block and self-attention, learning adaptive feature fusion for enhanced detail representation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ARM consistently improves baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with minimal computational overhead after being trained on a general dataset.

Conclusion: ARM provides an effective and efficient approach for training-free OVSS, showcasing universal applicability as a post-processor across diverse frameworks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

*Shuyun Wang,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Hangjun Ye,Xin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mirage, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and temporally coherent video editing in driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in video object editing for autonomous driving systems, which struggle with achieving high visual fidelity and temporal coherence, especially in diverse and scalable datasets.

Method: Mirage leverages a text-to-video diffusion prior for temporal consistency, enhances spatial fidelity by injecting 2D encoder latents into a 3D decoder, and adopts a two-stage alignment strategy (coarse 3D and fine 2D refinement) to improve pose alignments and supervision quality.

Result: The model demonstrates high realism and strong temporal consistency across various video editing scenarios, validating its capabilities through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Mirage effectively overcomes previous limitations in video editing for autonomous driving, achieving photorealistic and coherent results. It sets a new baseline for related tasks, with applications extending beyond asset editing.

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MotivNet, a facial emotion recognition model that achieves robust generalization across datasets without cross-domain training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial emotion recognition models struggle with generalization across diverse datasets, impacting real-world applicability.

Method: The authors utilize Meta-Sapiens, a foundational human vision model pre-trained as a Masked Autoencoder, as the backbone for MotivNet. They define benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity as criteria for evaluating the model.

Result: MotivNet showcases competitive performance across datasets, demonstrating strong generalization without relying on cross-domain training.

Conclusion: MotivNet validates its viability as a downstream task for Sapiens, improving facial emotion recognition's real-world applicability and incentivizing further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

*Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid,Jordan A. James,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CropTrack, a multiple-object tracking framework that successfully integrates motion and appearance information to improve identity preservation in agricultural environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural environments pose challenges to MOT due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden lighting changes, and frequent occlusions. Existing motion-based trackers struggle with retaining object identities under these circumstances.

Method: CropTrack combines motion and appearance information by introducing reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with conflict resolution, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank.

Result: CropTrack outperforms traditional motion-based trackers on agricultural datasets, showing enhanced identity preservation, higher identification F1 and association accuracy scores, and fewer identity switches.

Conclusion: CropTrack is a superior MOT framework for agricultural contexts, effectively addressing challenges through the integration of appearance and motion information, and advancing performance metrics over existing methods.

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

*Fuqiang Gu,Yuanke Li,Xianlei Long,Kangping Ji,Chao Chen,Qingyi Gu,Zhenliang Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaSeg is a semantic segmentation framework combining RGB and event camera data with a focus on spatial and temporal fusion for improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB-based methods struggle under conditions like fast motion or low light, while event cameras lack sufficient standalone visual detail. Multimodal fusion addresses these limitations.

Method: MambaSeg uses dual-branch encoders to model RGB and event data. The proposed DDIM module enables fine-grained spatial and temporal fusion to improve cross-modal alignment and reduce ambiguity.

Result: MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on DDD17 and DSEC datasets while reducing computational requirements.

Conclusion: MambaSeg effectively integrates RGB and event data for robust multimodal perception, advancing semantic segmentation with better efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

*Xunyi Zhao,Gengze Zhou,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VLN-MME, a benchmarking framework to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision-and-language navigation tasks, revealing their limitations in spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the potential of MLLMs in embodied navigation tasks, which require spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, and address the lack of systematic evaluation in these scenarios.

Method: Develop and present VLN-MME, a standardized framework for evaluating MLLMs as zero-shot agents in vision-and-language navigation tasks. The framework allows for modular experiments and ablations.

Result: Find that adding reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and self-reflection decreases performance in navigation tasks, highlighting low spatial reasoning fidelity and issues with context awareness in MLLMs.

Conclusion: VLN-MME provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for MLLMs, exposing their shortcomings in embodied navigation tasks and guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

*Zhi Li,Yaqi Wang,Bingtao Ma,Yifan Zhang,Huiyu Zhou,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PGMP framework to address Dental CBCT metal artifact reduction, combining anatomically-adaptive simulation, deterministic manifold projection, and semantic-structural alignment to improve diagnostic reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metal artifacts in dental CBCT hinder diagnosis and current approaches, either supervised or unsupervised deep learning, have notable limitations such as spectral blurring or structural hallucinations.

Method: It proposes PGMP framework which includes three components: Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) for training data synthesis, DMP-Former for deterministic and efficient restoration, and SSA module for clinical plausibility using medical foundation model priors.

Result: PGMP achieves new benchmarks by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy concerning efficiency and diagnostic reliability based on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets.

Conclusion: PGMP represents a significant step forward in efficient and reliable artifact reduction in dental CBCT imaging, usable in clinical applications.

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualityForge, a framework for creating counterfactual video datasets and enhances multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to address the issue of hallucinations in video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with visual hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors in video understanding, worsened by imbalanced training data types.

Method: The study presents a framework, DualityForge, employing diffusion-based video editing to create counterfactual video data combined with contrastive QA pairs, and utilizes a new training method, DNA-Train, for better policy optimization.

Result: Experiments with DualityForge and DNA-Train achieved a 24.0% improvement in counterfactual video analysis relative to the baseline, and showed strong performance across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances MLLM generalization and significantly reduces hallucinations; the code and dataset will be shared for further contributions to the field.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark to evaluate the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in low-light conditions, addressing an underexplored challenge for robust embodied agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VLMs ignore performance under low-light conditions, a critical issue for robust 24/7 operation in embodied agents.

Method: DarkEQA evaluates VLMs by isolating perception bottlenecks and simulating physics-based illumination degradation in linear RAW space, followed by ISP-like rendering for fidelity.

Result: The benchmark demonstrates limitations in the robustness of state-of-the-art VLMs and LLIE models when operating under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: DarkEQA provides a systematic tool for analyzing VLMs' robustness in challenging light environments and will make significant strides in addressing this overlooked issue.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

*Yuan Jia,Ruimin Wu,Rui Song,Jiaojiao Li,Bin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a 3D-based panoramic stitching framework to overcome limitations of traditional 2D approaches, achieving better alignment, consistency, and reducing distortions and artifacts in complex 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D stitching methods struggle with ghosting, distortions, and artifacts, especially in complex 3D scenes with multiple depth layers, parallax, and occlusions. This limitation is especially problematic for 360° panoramic and multi-view stitching.

Method: The proposed framework lifts input images into a dense 3D point representation within a unified coordinate system. A unified projection center and equidistant cylindrical projection are used for mapping, while hole-filling addresses viewpoint transitions, ensuring consistency.

Result: The method demonstrated substantial improvement in reducing geometric distortions, ghosting artifacts, and maintaining coherence in 360° panoramic scenes, particularly in challenging scenarios involving parallax and occlusions.

Conclusion: Reconceptualizing image stitching from a 2D warping to a 3D consistency paradigm substantially enhances stitching quality, offering more natural and structurally correct panoramas across complex scenes.

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot introduces a video diffusion model for controllable space-time generative rendering, re-rendering monocular videos by altering camera viewpoints and motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous and arbitrary exploration of dynamic scenes across space and time, addressing the lack of paired datasets for such variations.

Method: The model incorporates an animation time-embedding mechanism, a temporal-warping training scheme repurposing multi-view datasets, improved camera-conditioning, and a novel CamxTime dataset.

Result: SpaceTimePilot achieves robust space-time disentanglement, precise temporal control, and outperforms prior work across real-world and synthetic data.

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot effectively enables controllable generative rendering, offering precise manipulation of camera and motion for dynamic video exploration.

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

TL;DR: EndoRare is a generative AI framework that creates realistic images of rare gastrointestinal lesions from one reference image to aid AI development and novice clinician training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare gastrointestinal lesions lack sufficient data for developing AI systems and educating clinicians, necessitating innovative approaches for better representation and training.

Method: EndoRare synthesizes diverse lesion images using language-guided concept disentanglement, separating diagnostic features from non-diagnostic ones for high-fidelity image generation.

Result: Clinical experts validated the synthetic images as plausible, improving AI classifiers' performance and enhancing novice clinician recall and precision through augmented training.

Conclusion: EndoRare provides an effective solution to address the rare-disease data gap, benefiting AI development and clinical education in diagnostics.

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Virtual-Eyes, a specialized preprocessing pipeline for low-dose CT lung cancer screening, showing its benefits for generalist models but potential disruption for specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust preprocessing methods in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT lung cancer screening and examine its impact on different model types.

Method: Development of Virtual-Eyes, a 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline ensuring strict anatomical targeting and high resolution, coupled with validation on various models using patient data from NLST.

Result: Virtual-Eyes improves generalist foundation models like RAD-DINO, boosting slice-level and patient-level AUC scores significantly, but disrupts performance for specialist models like Sybil and ResNet-18.

Conclusion: Anatomically targeted quality control can enhance generalist foundation-model workflows but may destabilize specialist models reliant on raw clinical data.

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CERES, a causal framework enhancing Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation by addressing language biases and visual confounding issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation caused by ambiguities in egocentric videos and biases in training data to better understand human behavior.

Method: CERES, a causal framework, uses dual-modal interventions: backdoor adjustment to handle language representation biases and front-door adjustment to address visual confounding by integrating visual and depth features based on causal principles.

Result: CERES demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: Applying causal reasoning through the CERES framework improves Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation, leading to more reliable understanding of egocentric video data.

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

Result: SenseNova-MARS outperforms proprietary models like Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5 on benchmarks including MMSearch and HR-MMSearch, proving its capabilities in fine-grained visual understanding.

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS advances agentic reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models, setting a new benchmark for multimodal systems with interleaved reasoning and tool-use integration.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

TL;DR: LVLDrive is a new Vision-Language Model (VLM) framework for autonomous driving, combining LiDAR and image data to improve 3D understanding and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current vision-language models (VLMs) in achieving reliable and accurate metric spatial reasoning due to reliance on 2D image data.

Method: A Gradual Fusion Q-Former is introduced to incorporate LiDAR 3D features into pre-trained VLMs without disrupting their existing knowledge, along with a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to train the model for advanced 3D perception.

Result: The model outperforms vision-only VLMs in scene understanding, 3D spatial reasoning, and driving decision-making across driving benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D metric input like LiDAR with VLMs enhances their reliability and performance for autonomous driving, emphasizing the importance of 3D data for these systems.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

*Liam Frija-Altrac,Matthew Toews*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for understanding convolutional filtering in CNNs by linking it to concepts from physics like relativity and quantum mechanics, examining kernel behaviors through energy and momentum analogies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to establish a deeper understanding of convolutional filtering in CNNs by drawing inspiration from fundamental principles in physics, specifically energy and momentum, to provide insights into the mechanics of information processing.

Method: The study analyzes kernel behavior in convolutional filters by decomposing them into orthogonal even and odd components. Using the spectral domain and discrete cosine transform (DCT), the research explores the effects of these components in small-scale convolutional filters and their role in defining information propagation.

Result: The findings reveal that even kernels represent isotropic image diffusion preserving center of mass, while odd kernels cause directional shifts. The relationship between speed of information displacement and odd-to-total kernel energy is also established. These dynamics are further tied to the energy-momentum relationship from relativistic physics.

Conclusion: This work highlights a novel conceptual bridge between CNN information processing and physics principles, potentially advancing the theoretical understanding of kernel operations in convolutional neural networks.

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DermaVQA-DAS, an enhanced dermatological dataset with two tasks (QA and lesion segmentation) supported by a new structured assessment framework (DAS). Evaluation shows promising performance for multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dermatological image analysis datasets lack patient-centered elements like queries and clinical contexts, limiting their applicability to patient care.

Method: The paper develops the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) for structured clinical annotation, extends the DermaVQA dataset, and evaluates multitask performance using state-of-the-art models.

Result: The dataset achieves high performance: segmentation task Jaccard index of 0.395 and Dice score of 0.566; QA accuracy ranges from 0.729 to 0.798, with o3 model performing best.

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS provides a valuable benchmark for enhancing patient-centered dermatological image analysis and supports future multimodal research.

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

*Bohong Chen,Haiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyStream is a method for generating responsive talking head videos in real time with ultra-low latency and high lip-sync quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating talking head videos have high latency due to dependence on non-causal context windows, hindering real-time realistic interactions.

Method: DyStream uses an autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads and a causal encoder with a lookahead module to incorporate short future contexts for real-time video generation.

Result: The method achieves video generation within 34 ms per frame and guarantees system latency under 100 ms, with state-of-the-art LipSync Confidence scores.

Conclusion: DyStream effectively balances ultra-low latency and high-quality real-time talking head video generation, significantly improving over existing methods.

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

*Yan Meng,Daniel A. Donoho,Marcelle Altshuler,Omar Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI framework for automated evaluation of surgical microanastomosis performance, overcoming subjective limitations of conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for assessing surgical skills are subjective, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-limited settings.

Method: The proposed AI system uses a TimeSformer-based video transformer with attention mechanisms for action recognition, combined with YOLO-based object detection for motion analysis.

Result: The system achieved 87.7% accuracy in action segmentation, 93.62% with post-processing, and an average 76% accuracy in replicating expert assessments.

Conclusion: This framework enables objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, offering scalable data-driven solutions for surgical training and evaluation.

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder learns representations through compositionality using a new framework and Discrete Wavelet Transform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the representational structure within the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and analyze compositionality in its representation space.

Method: A framework is introduced to test compositionality using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) primitives, examining how composed representations reproduce original image representations.

Result: Primitives derived using one-level DWT decomposition show that ViT encoder representations approximately compose in latent space.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that ViTs structure information compositionally, providing insights into how they process visual data.

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for compressing solar imagery, improving spectral and spatial detail preservation while reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to tackle the challenge of compressing high-fidelity multispectral solar imagery for space missions where bandwidth is limited.

Method: The framework uses two modules: iSWGE to represent inter-band relationships as a graph and WSGA-C for reducing spatial redundancy through graph and block attention.

Result: Tests show 20.15% reduction in MSID, up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and 1.62% MS-SSIM gains over baselines, producing sharper reconstructions.

Conclusion: The framework delivers effective compression with improved fidelity, aiding solar studies and space applications, and the code is publicly accessible.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) network using lower-level features, specifically DINOv2, which minimizes hallucinations and is better suited for consumer-grade smartphone cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphone cameras require SISR with minimal hallucinations for higher-fidelity input images, while existing generative models like Text-2-Image Diffusion are prone to undesirable artifacts and not optimized for high-resolution images.

Method: The authors propose Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff), a model using DINOv2 features for conditioning, which are stricter and rich enough to handle small patches of high-resolution images more effectively.

Result: The network provides improved SISR quality by leveraging lower-level conditioning features, tailored for high-fidelity smartphone images, while avoiding strong generation artifacts.

Conclusion: Using lower-level feature-based conditioning, as introduced in F2IDiff, addresses the challenges of hallucination and enables effective SISR on high-resolution consumer images, especially in smartphone photography.

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

TL;DR: The study combines YOLO models for anomaly detection in chest X-rays with GPT-4 to generate radiology reports, achieving high semantic similarity but stylistic differences compared to radiologist-authored texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between structured predictions from CV systems and narrative reports required by radiologists using advancements in large language models.

Method: The pipeline integrates YOLO models (v5 and v8) for detecting anomalies in X-rays, with outputs fed into GPT-4 to create descriptive findings and clinical summaries. Evaluation includes detection accuracy, latency, and similarity of AI-generated reports to ground-truth reports.

Result: Strong semantic similarity was observed between AI-generated and human-authored reports. YOLOv8 had better detection performance, and GPT-4 achieved high clarity but lacked a natural writing flow.

Conclusion: While AI systems demonstrate clinical accuracy, they need improvement in replicating the natural style of radiologist-authored text for better applicability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-VQ-VAE, a model for compact video representations optimized for low-resolution video compression, making it suitable for bandwidth-sensitive and edge deployment scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential increase in video traffic demands enhanced compression methods that are compatible with deep learning and edge-device performance limitations.

Method: The paper develops a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE), extending VQ-VAE-2 to handle spatiotemporal settings using 3D residual convolutions and hierarchical latent structures. Perceptual loss from VGG16 is also employed.

Result: The model, trained on 64x64 resolution video clips from the UCF101 dataset, achieves 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM, surpassing a baseline model by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM on validation.

Conclusion: MS-VQ-VAE efficiently compresses video for bandwidth-sensitive applications like real-time streaming, mobile analytics, and CDN storage, offering high-quality reconstruction and scalability.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Method: The researchers developed a Physics-Augmented Pipeline (PhyAugPipe) for data collection and proposed PhyGDPO, a physics-aware optimization framework employing groupwise preferences and reward schemes for physical consistency.

Result: The approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets such as PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Conclusion: This method advances the field of text-to-video generation by integrating physics-aware optimizations, addressing prior limitations and enhancing video realism.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Motivation: Current visual grounding benchmarks are derived from clean datasets with limited complexity, failing to capture real-world environmental challenges critical for robust and generalized performance.

Method: The authors developed RGBT-Ground, a dataset with RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs, high-quality annotations, and a unified framework for uni-modal and multi-modal inputs. They also propose RGBT-VGNet to fuse these modalities for robust grounding.

Result: RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms adapted existing methods, especially in challenging scenarios such as nighttime and long-distance cases.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and model demonstrate robust visual grounding capabilities in diverse and challenging real-world environments, paving the way for further research in this area.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of decision ambiguity in CDVQA models, where the model struggles to discriminate between correct answers and strong distractors.

Method: The method involves mining Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) using supervised fine-tuning and employing Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DARFT) to optimize these samples.

Result: DARFT significantly improves the CDVQA model’s performance by suppressing strong distractors and refining decision-making, especially in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing DAS through DARFT enhances the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in identifying systematic errors in computer vision tasks by introducing SliceLens, which uses advanced reasoning frameworks to better identify error slices, and a new benchmark (FeSD) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limitations in existing methods for discovering error slices in multi-instance vision tasks, and address the bias in existing benchmarks tailored mainly for image classification.

Method: The proposed system, SliceLens, uses large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for hypothesis-driven error analysis. A benchmark (FeSD) is also introduced, featuring refined ground-truth slices for evaluating performance in error slice discovery.

Result: SliceLens demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, including a 0.42 improvement in Precision@10 on FeSD, while its identified error slices allow for actionable model improvements.

Conclusion: SliceLens significantly advances fine-grained error slice discovery and sets a new standard for benchmarking such methods with FeSD, leading to more robust computer vision models.

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D semantic segmentation models and datasets are inadequate for post-disaster assessment, creating a need for specialized benchmarks to enhance disaster response capabilities.

Method: A 3D dataset was constructed using UAV footage of Hurricane Ian via SfM and MVS techniques. SOTA 3D semantic segmentation models (FPT, PTv3, and OA-CNNs) were evaluated on this dataset.

Result: The evaluated models demonstrated significant limitations in handling disaster-stricken environments, highlighting deficiencies in current methods.

Conclusion: This study reveals the critical necessity for improved 3D segmentation methods and dedicated datasets to better aid post-disaster scene analysis.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

### [177] [Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation for Pre-Trained Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24603)
*Zheng Liu,Jinchao Zhu,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (CLoRA), an approach aimed at improving fine-tuning efficiency and learning performance in pre-trained vision transformers by sharing low-rank parameter spaces and enforcing diverse representation regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing fine-tuning methods for pre-trained vision transformers, which often compromise between parameter efficiency and learning performance. Current methods either reduce performance or use too many trainable parameters.

Method: CLoRA combines base-space sharing, where all low-rank modules (LRMs) share projection spaces, and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE), which promotes diverse representation during training.

Result: Experimental results across image and point cloud datasets show that CLoRA offers a better trade-off between learning performance and parameter efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while also requiring fewer GFLOPs for point cloud analysis.

Conclusion: CLoRA successfully balances learning performance and parameter efficiency in low-rank adaptation, pushing the boundary of efficient fine-tuning strategies for pre-trained vision transformers.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of datasets and methods for 3D visual grounding in complex outdoor traffic environments monitored by roadside infrastructure.

Method: The authors constructed MoniRefer, a large-scale dataset, and proposed a method Moni3DVG combining multi-modal features from images and point clouds for learning and localization.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness and superior performance of Moni3DVG on the proposed MoniRefer benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study successfully enables 3D visual grounding for roadside infrastructure and contributes a novel dataset and methodology valuable to traffic scene understanding.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Motivation: To address the issue of numerous outliers in feature point matching, which reduces accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with high proportions of outliers.

Method: The authors propose a Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network using stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and attention mechanisms. It includes a layer-by-layer channel fusion module for preserving semantic information and a hierarchical attention module for integrating global perception and semantic structural data.

Result: Experiments on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: The method enhances feature point matching accuracy in computer vision through effective outlier handling and semantic information integration, demonstrating superior results on benchmarks.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

*Qingyu Xu,Runtong Zhang,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in object detection for fire rescue scenarios by introducing a new dataset 'FireRescue' and proposing an improved detection model FRS-YOLO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in fire rescue object detection, including a lack of focus on urban rescue scenes and limited diversity in detection categories.

Method: The paper introduces 'FireRescue' dataset with diverse scenarios and eight key categories, and proposes FRS-YOLO which includes attention modules and dynamic feature sampling to enhance detection.

Result: The proposed methods improve detection performance and overcome inter-class confusion, missed detection, and challenges of chaotic fire rescue scenarios.

Conclusion: The advanced dataset and detection model significantly enhance object detection capabilities, enabling better command and decision-making in firefighting operations.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RadAR, a radial decoding framework to accelerate autoregressive visual generation by leveraging spatial correlations and parallelizing token prediction effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of traditional sequential token-by-token decoding in autoregressive models for visual generation. The goal is to improve inference speed while maintaining representational quality.

Method: RadAR organizes visual token generation in a radial topology, grouping tokens into concentric rings for parallel prediction. Additionally, a nested attention mechanism refines outputs dynamically, reducing errors and preserving consistency.

Result: RadAR achieves significant improvements in generation efficiency, maintaining structural locality and coherence in visual outputs.

Conclusion: RadAR demonstrates the feasibility of efficient, parallelizable autoregressive visual generation through radial topology and nested attention, providing a method that enhances both speed and output quality.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGTN, a novel framework for Tensor Network Structure Search, achieving top efficiency and compression through multi-scale renormalization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Tensor Network Structure Search methods struggle with challenges in optimization scalability, adaptability, and computational efficiency due to single-scale optimization, discrete search spaces, and separated structure-parameter optimization.

Method: The authors propose RGTN, a physics-inspired approach using multi-scale renormalization. It introduces learnable edge gates for adaptive topology, dynamic scale transformations for smooth structure evolution, and stress and information flow to guide decisions.

Result: RGTN delivers state-of-the-art performance with high compression ratios and speed improvements (4-600 times faster) on various data types including light fields, synthetic tensors, and video tasks.

Conclusion: RGTN's physics-guided multi-scale framework significantly advances Tensor Network search by improving adaptability, efficiency, and structural performance, showcasing its practical efficacy across large-scale data tasks.

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVOL-SAM3, a zero-shot framework for reasoning segmentation, using an evolutionary search process to refine prompt hypotheses for better pixel-level localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current reasoning segmentation approaches (SFT and RL), which suffer from issues like catastrophic forgetting, training instability, and reliance on rigid paradigms.

Method: The proposed framework EVOL-SAM3 uses an inference-time "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop with a Visual Arena for fitness evaluation, a Semantic Mutation operator for diversity, and a Heterogeneous Arena module for robust selection.

Result: EVOL-SAM3 significantly outperforms static methods and fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the ReasonSeg benchmark in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3 effectively addresses reasoning segmentation challenges by introducing an adaptive, evolutionary search-based inference process, showing promising results without requiring training.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently balancing the trade-off between computational cost and model performance by optimizing the resource usage across various timesteps of the model's operation.

Method: Proposing FlowBlending, a multi-model sampling strategy that uses a large model during capacity-sensitive stages and a smaller model during intermediate stages. This includes defining stage boundaries using simple criteria and employing velocity-divergence analysis to identify capacity-sensitive regions.

Result: FlowBlending delivers up to 1.65x faster inference, uses 57.35% fewer FLOPs, maintains the quality of output, and achieves additional speedup when combined with other acceleration techniques.

Conclusion: FlowBlending effectively reduces computational demands while preserving performance by adapting model usage based on specific stage requirements. It is compatible with other optimization techniques for further improvements.

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VT2A approaches lack balance between visual and textual conditioning, fail in fine-grained controllable sound generation definitions, and have weak instruction understanding due to limitations in existing datasets.

Method: The authors developed EchoFoley, a task emphasizing sound control at event and semantic levels, and proposed EchoVidia, a framework utilizing symbolic representation and a slow-fast thinking strategy. Additionally, they curated the EchoFoley-6k dataset containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets.

Result: EchoVidia demonstrated a 40.7% improvement in sound controllability and a 12.5% enhancement in perceptual quality over recent models.

Conclusion: The proposed EchoFoley and EchoVidia significantly advance video-grounded sound generation with enhanced precision, controllability, and scalable applications.

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views in 3D instance/semantic segmentation methods, which leads to poor predictions.

Method: A unified framework integrates label preprocessing, contrastive learning, and segmentation embedding into Gaussian primitives, refined using hard-mining and stabilized with a linear layer during the triplet loss calculation.

Result: The proposed method achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements compared to baselines on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Conclusion: By optimizing a unified segmentation approach and addressing boundary issues with stabilization techniques, the method effectively enhances multi-view 3D segmentation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Method: The CPJ framework uses large vision-language models to generate multi-angle image captions, refines them using a 'LLM-as-Judge' module, and applies a dual-answer VQA process for recognition and management tasks.

Result: On the CDDMBench benchmark, CPJ with GPT-5-mini captions significantly improves disease classification by +22.7 percentage points and QA scores by +19.5 points compared to no-caption baselines.

Conclusion: The CPJ framework enhances crop disease diagnosis through interpretable and robust methods, enabling evidence-based reasoning and eliminating the need for supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

### [189] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in the Noise2Noise method caused by nonlinearities in image preprocessing and proposes a framework for minimizing bias introduced by nonlinear functions during training, enabling effective denoising with noisy training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise eliminates the need for clean target images in training denoisers; however, it is hindered when nonlinear functions skew results. The challenge is to enable such preprocessing without introducing significant biases.

Method: A theoretical analysis is developed to identify classes of nonlinear functions that introduce minimal bias. These insights are applied to denoising high dynamic range images by combining tonal mapping functions and loss functions effectively.

Result: The paper demonstrates that certain tone mapping functions can be used with Noise2Noise for HDR image denoising, reducing dynamic range issues and outliers. Results achieved are nearly at par with original methods requiring clean reference images.

Conclusion: The Noise2Noise method can be adapted to work harmoniously with certain nonlinear preprocessing functions, enabling robust denoising without relying on clean training targets, specifically in demanding HDR scenarios.

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to adapt cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to handle 3D scenes by controlling an in-scene camera using mutual information optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dimensionality shifts from 2D to 3D in cross-modal systems and improve adaptation to occlusions and feature differentiation in 3D scenes.

Method: The method employs regret minimization with derivative-free optimization to improve multivariate mutual information estimates, enabling an in-scene camera to adapt online to noisy vision-language model outputs.

Result: The approach improves the performance of cross-modal tasks in multi-object 3D scenes without needing pretraining or finetuning.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully bridges the 2D-3D dimensionality gap in cross-modal systems, showcasing efficiency in adapting to 3D tasks while bypassing additional resource-heavy model adjustments.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

*Meng Lan,Lefei Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OFL-SAM2 is a framework for medical image segmentation that eliminates the need for manual prompts and extensive data annotation by training a lightweight mapping network on limited samples. It enhances feature transformation and segmentation accuracy during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to adapt Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)’s capabilities for medical image segmentation (MIS), addressing challenges like dependency on extensive annotated data and manual prompts that require expert intervention.

Method: The authors propose the OFL-SAM2 framework, which includes a lightweight mapping network for transforming generic features into task-specific features and an online few-shot learner for training the network on limited data. Additionally, an adaptive fusion module integrates features dynamically during inference, eliminating the reliance on manual prompts.

Result: Experiments on three MIS datasets show that OFL-SAM2 delivers state-of-the-art performance while requiring less annotated training data compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: OFL-SAM2 demonstrates that incorporating a lightweight mapping network and adaptive processing achieves effective and efficient MIS, addressing the limitations of current approaches and showcasing potential for broader application.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Motivation: To create a challenging benchmark that pushes multimodal large language models to perform expert-level financial reasoning in real-world scenarios.

Method: Development of FinMMDocR, including expert-annotated problems and complex documents, along with evaluation of model performance in reasoning tasks.

Result: The best-performing model achieves only 58.0% accuracy, showing room for improvement in reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation methods.

Conclusion: FinMMDocR will enhance the development of advanced multimodal reasoning models for handling complex financial tasks effectively in real-world settings.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lidar domain adaptation method that achieves state-of-the-art performance using minimal annotation from the target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization challenges of 3D object detectors across different domains such as regions outside where the model was trained.

Method: A novel approach based on neuron activation patterns is proposed for domain adaptation, using post-training techniques inspired by continual learning to prevent weight drift.

Result: The empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach surpasses both linear probing and existing domain adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: A small, representative, and diverse subset of target domain samples can significantly enhance domain adaptation with minimal annotation effort.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source film restoration methods often fail to match commercial alternatives, mainly due to synthetic data quality and optical flow issues. High-resolution film processing remains unexplored by open-source methods.

Method: The framework employs patch-wise training/testing for handling high-resolution films on limited GPU memory, introduces innovative modules like Global Prompt, Frame Fusion, and frequency-based reconstruction, and integrates residual results to reduce artifacts. A new dataset combining real-degraded films and synthetic data is constructed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProDM, a generative diffusion framework, to mitigate motion artifacts in coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using non-gated chest CTs, significantly improving accuracy and clinical usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECG-gated cardiac CTs reduce motion artifacts for CAC scoring but are not widely accessible for population screening due to cost and technical barriers. Non-gated chest CTs are more accessible but suffer from motion artifacts, motivating the need for advanced correction techniques.

Method: The ProDM framework employs three components: (1) a CAC motion simulation engine synthesizing non-gated scans from cardiac-gated CTs; (2) property-aware learning with calcium-specific priors to maintain lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction strategy to iteratively reduce artifacts during diffusion.

Result: Experimental validation on patient datasets demonstrates that ProDM enhances CAC scoring accuracy, preserves spatial lesion fidelity, and improves risk stratification. A reader study confirms its ability to suppress motion artifacts and increase clinical utility in non-gated chest CTs.

Conclusion: ProDM offers a reliable, accessible solution for CAC quantification, overcoming limitations of motion artifacts in non-gated chest CT imaging, thus enabling improved cardiovascular risk assessment in routine clinical settings.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper discusses limitations in existing video reasoning evaluations and introduces a new benchmark (VIPER) and metric (POC@r) to assess reasoning quality in video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-frame evaluations in video generation models that lead to outcome-hacking and fail to adequately measure reasoning consistency.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark named VIPER with 16 tasks and introduce a new metric, Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), that uses a hierarchical rubric and language model evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate only about 20% on the new metric (POC@1.0), revealing significant shortcomings in their reasoning capabilities and outcome reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed VIPER benchmark and POC@r metric reveal that current video models are far from achieving robust generative video reasoning. These tools aim to encourage development in the domain by identifying weaknesses in reasoning processing.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ShowUI-$π$, a flow-based generative model allowing GUI agents to perform both discrete and continuous actions, particularly focusing on smooth drag capabilities using innovative methodologies, outperforming previous agents on the ScreenDrag benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop intelligent GUI agents capable of performing dexterous manipulation comparable to humans, addressing limitations in current agents that can only predict discrete click actions and lack continuous, closed-loop trajectory handling.

Method: The paper proposes ShowUI-$π$ with three key components: unified discrete-continuous action modeling, flow-based generation for dragging actions, and a large dataset (20K trajectories) alongside the ScreenDrag benchmark for training and evaluation.

Result: ShowUI-$π$ significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art GUI agents on the ScreenDrag benchmark, achieving a score of 26.98 compared to competitors such as Operator (13.27) and Gemini-2.5-CUA (22.18).

Conclusion: The work highlights the challenges of developing human-like dexterous GUI agents and demonstrates the efficiency and efficacy of using a flow-based generative approach to advance the field.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Conclusion: Customized combinations of compression techniques can equip models with improved robustness and efficiency, making them well-suited for deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID) task and proposes the Bi-C2R framework to efficiently address catastrophic forgetting and compatibility issues without requiring gallery re-indexing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve lifelong person re-identification systems by addressing catastrophic forgetting and compatibility issues caused by high re-indexing costs and privacy concerns with historical gallery data.

Method: It introduces the Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework for continuously updating gallery features in a compatible and efficient manner across diverse streaming data.

Result: The Bi-C2R method achieves leading performance on both RFL-ReID and traditional L-ReID tasks, validated through theoretical analysis and experiments on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: RFL-ReID is a more challenging task than L-ReID, but the proposed Bi-C2R framework effectively overcomes these challenges, enabling lifelong Re-ID without re-indexing and improving overall performance.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Result: Achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality on challenging datasets while running in real-time at 18 FPS.

Conclusion: FoundationSLAM demonstrates robust performance, practical generalization across scenarios, and advances practical dense SLAM methods through a novel integration of learning and geometric reasoning.

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for audio-driven visual dubbing, shifting it from a challenging inpainting task to a robust video-to-video editing approach using a Diffusion Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in audio-driven visual dubbing face challenges due to lack of ideal training data, leading to visual artifacts and poor lip synchronization.

Method: The paper utilizes a Diffusion Transformer, first to generate ideal training data (lip-altered companion videos), and then as an audio-driven editor trained with complete visually aligned video frames.

Result: The proposed method achieves precise lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, robustness in real-world scenarios, and improved visual fidelity. A new benchmark dataset (ContextDubBench) is also introduced for evaluation.

Conclusion: This approach addresses existing challenges in visual dubbing, demonstrating superior performance and robustness with a self-bootstrapping Diffusion Transformer framework and rich visual conditioning.

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Motivation: Real-world scenarios often involve significant missing data in skeleton sequences due to pose estimation challenges. Existing methods fail to fully recover subtle temporal and spatial cues, making fine-grained action recognition difficult.

Method: FineTec restores corrupted skeleton sequences using context-aware completion, spatial decomposition into semantic regions, and physics-driven Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. The processed data is used in a GCN-based recognition model.

Result: FineTec achieves high accuracies in challenging benchmarks, particularly 89.1% accuracy on Gym99-severe and 78.1% on Gym288-severe settings, showcasing robust performance under corruption.

Conclusion: FineTec is an effective and robust framework for fine-grained action recognition in corrupted skeleton sequences, outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

### [203] [Edit3r: Instant 3D Scene Editing from Sparse Unposed Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25071)
*Jiageng Liu,Weijie Lyu,Xueting Li,Yejie Guo,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit3r is a framework for reconstructing and editing 3D scenes from inconsistent, edited 2D images without optimization or pose estimation, offering real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, photorealistic, and instruction-aligned 3D scene reconstruction and editing from unposed and inconsistent images, overcoming limitations of optimization-heavy prior methods.

Method: Edit3r uses a feed-forward network trained with cross-view-consistent supervision (via SAM2-based recoloring) and asymmetric input strategies, ensuring alignment of disparate image views.

Result: Edit3r outperforms prior baselines in semantic alignment and 3D consistency, handles 2D method-based image edits effectively at high speeds, and evaluates well on the DL3DV-Edit-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: Edit3r demonstrates its potential for real-time 3D scene editing applications with quick, accurate, and visually consistent results compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

*Yi-Chuan Huang,Hao-Jen Chien,Chin-Yang Lin,Ying-Huan Chen,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GaMO, a new framework for reconstructing 3D scenes using sparse views, achieving improved quality, consistency, and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in 3D reconstruction from sparse views, such as inadequate scene coverage, geometric inconsistencies, and high computational costs.

Method: GaMO extends the field of view from existing camera poses using multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies for zero-shot multi-view outpainting, without requiring additional training.

Result: GaMO achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality (better PSNR and LPIPS scores) on Replica and ScanNet++ datasets, while being 25x faster than diffusion-based methods, with processing times under 10 minutes.

Conclusion: GaMO provides high-quality, consistent, and efficient 3D reconstructions from sparse views, addressing key limitations in current 3D reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Motivation: Cloud data pipelines face challenges like dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, high operational overhead, and strict governance requirements. Traditional static configurations are inefficient.

Method: The study proposes integrating bounded AI agents into pipelines, using telemetry and metadata to enforce cost and compliance policies with adaptive actions validated for governance.

Result: Experiments show up to 45% faster recovery times, 25% cost reduction, and 70% fewer manual interventions without compromising policy compliance or data freshness.

Conclusion: Policy-bounded AI agents improve the efficiency, reliability, and governance of cloud data pipelines, offering practical solutions for enterprise environments.

Abstract: Cloud data pipelines increasingly operate under dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, cost constraints, and strict governance requirements. Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance. These results demonstrate that policy-bounded agentic control provides an effective and practical approach for governing cloud data pipelines in enterprise environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of managing heterogeneous tasks and limited resources in edge servers to enable efficient data processing close to end devices.

Method: It conducts profiling experiments to establish a model showing the relationship between resource allocation and latency, formulates an NP-hard optimization problem, and proposes a two-stage container-based resource management scheme using convex optimization and greedy refinement.

Result: The CRMS reduces latency by over 14% and improves energy efficiency compared to existing methods in dynamic heterogeneous edge environments.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme is practical and scalable for heterogeneous edge computing scenarios, offering improved latency and energy performance under dynamic workloads.

Abstract: Edge computing enables latency-critical applications to process data close to end devices, yet task heterogeneity and limited resources pose significant challenges to efficient orchestration. This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that CRMS reduces latency by over 14\% and improves energy efficiency compared with heuristic and search-based baselines, offering a practical and scalable solution for heterogeneous edge environments with dynamic workload characteristics.

*Yanbing Yang,Huiling Zhu,Wenchi Cheng,Jingqing Wang,Changrun Chen,Jiangzhou Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of federated learning in wireless networks caused by data heterogeneity among clients, proposing an optimized approach to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies in federated learning caused by client data heterogeneity, which lead to increased energy consumption, longer training cycles, and decreased performance in large-scale wireless networks.

Method: The paper formulates an optimization problem addressing learning latency and energy consumption with constraints on generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is proposed using convex optimization and relaxation techniques.

Result: The proposed CSRA scheme significantly improves test accuracy, reduces learning latency, and lowers energy consumption compared to baseline methods that neglect data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Careful consideration of client data heterogeneity alongside joint optimization of client selection and resource allocation enhances the performance and efficiency of federated learning in wireless networks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables mobile edge devices, functioning as clients, to collaboratively train a decentralized model while ensuring local data privacy. However, the efficiency of FL in wireless networks is limited not only by constraints on communication and computational resources but also by significant data heterogeneity among clients, particularly in large-scale networks. This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSRA scheme yields higher test accuracy, reduced learning latency, and lower energy consumption compared to baseline methods that do not account for data heterogeneity.

*Bo Jiang,Taolue Yang,Youyuan Liu,Xubin He,Sheng Di,Sian Jin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents PackKV, a framework to address memory challenges in Transformer-based LLMs during long-context inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing memory requirements of key-value (KV) cache in Transformer models make long-context inference computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes PackKV, a lossy compression management framework tailored for KV cache data, harmonizing compression algorithms with system design.

Result: Achieves 153.2% higher K cache memory reduction, 179.6% for V cache, and significant throughput improvements over existing methods on GPUs.

Conclusion: PackKV efficiently reduces memory consumption and boosts execution speed for long-context inference in Transformer models.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications. However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \textbf{153.2}\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \textbf{179.6}\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \textbf{75.7}\% for K and \textbf{171.7}\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

*Mikaila J. Gossman,Avinash Maurya,Bogdan Nicolae,Jon C. Calhoun*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of efficient checkpointing in large-scale LLM training by exploring advanced I/O strategies like \texttt{liburing} and achieving substantial improvements in write throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of checkpointing large-scale language models, which involve a significant I/O problem due to dealing with numerous tensors and varying performance bottlenecks in the storage stack.

Method: The authors develop microbenchmarks to evaluate \texttt{liburing} for LLM checkpointing. They analyze trade-offs involving aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing under buffered and direct I/O scenarios.

Result: Their method outperforms existing LLM checkpointing engines, achieving up to 3.9× better write throughput than DataStates-LLM and 7.6× better than TorchSnapshot.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of coalescing and aggregation strategies that are aligned with modern file systems and I/O backends for optimizing LLM checkpointing.

Abstract: As LLMs and foundation models scale, checkpoint/restore has become a critical pattern for training and inference. With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot. These results highlight the need for aggregation and coalescing strategies that align with modern file systems and I/O backends.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive framework for bilevel optimization in low-resource clients, using a second-order free hypergradient estimator to optimize submodels based on available resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distributed bilevel optimization algorithms are unsuitable for low-resource clients due to excessive computation demands in optimizing both levels of functions.

Method: The authors propose the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, optimizing submodels according to resource availability.

Result: The framework achieves an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{C_x^{\ast}Q})$, determined by minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\ast}$. Experiments confirm its effectiveness and computational efficiency in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Both proposed methods (RABO and RAFBO) are effective in overcoming computational limitations, proving optimal convergence rates and showing promising results in experiments over various tasks.

Abstract: With the development of large-scale models, traditional distributed bilevel optimization algorithms cannot be applied directly in low-resource clients. The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{C_x^{\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\ast}$. Extensive experiments on two different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of our proposed methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-cluster systems are hindered by their reactive resource management approaches, which lead to inefficiencies, slower adaptation, and operational challenges under varying workloads.

Method: The paper proposes an AI-driven framework incorporating predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and feedback analysis for proactive, cross-cluster resource management.

Result: The prototype implementation showed better resource efficiency, quicker adaptation to workload changes, and reduced performance variability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Intelligent and self-adaptive infrastructure management is essential for future scalable and resilient cloud systems.

Abstract: Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network faults in large-scale ML operations cause significant GPU hours wastage due to job terminations and slow recovery.

Method: R$^2$CCL uses multi-NIC hardware for rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to recover from failures.

Result: Experiments show R$^2$CCL minimizes training overhead to under 1% and inference overhead to under 3%, outperforming AdapCC and DejaVu by significant margins.

Conclusion: R$^2$CCL is a robust solution for fault-tolerant communication, enhancing efficiency in ML training/inference during network failures.

Abstract: Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\% training and less than 3\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\times$ and 47$\times$, respectively.

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).

Motivation: The paper aims to address the hardware inefficiency of current model recovery methods in real-time, autonomous systems under constraints like latency, computational power, and energy.

Method: MERINDA replaces Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly setup employing GRU-based dynamics, sparse dropout, dense inverse-ODE layers, and lightweight solvers optimized for FPGA acceleration.

Result: MERINDA outperforms GPU implementations with 114X lower energy consumption, 28X smaller memory usage, and 1.68X faster training while maintaining model recovery accuracy.

Conclusion: MERINDA demonstrates the feasibility of accurate, efficient model recovery for edge devices, facilitating real-time physical AI in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \textbf{114$\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\ 49{,}375~J), \textbf{28$\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\ 6{,}118~MB), and \textbf{1.68$\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy. These results demonstrate that MERINDA can bring accurate, explainable MR to the edge for real-time monitoring of autonomous systems.

Motivation: To understand and improve the fixing effectiveness of Deep Learning systems' faults, ensuring better safety and addressing potential risks in diverse industrial applications.

Method: Conducted a large-scale empirical study of 16 DL fixing approaches categorized at model, layer, and neuron levels across diverse datasets and setups.

Result: Model-level approaches are most effective in fixing, but no single method ensures fixing along with improved accuracy and maintenance of other properties.

Conclusion: Research should address trade-offs in fixing DL models by mitigating side effects, offering new directions for future work in academia and industry.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.

Method: The study introduces N:M structured pruning and 4-bit quantization, integrates them with hardware accelerators (CPUs, GPUs, and FPGA), and designs a pipeline for reduced memory consumption and faster inference.

Result: The approach achieves up to 4× reduction in weight storage, 1.71× speedup in matrix multiplication, and 1.29× improvement in latency compared to dense GPU setups. Throughput per token is enhanced by 1.36× for LLaMA-7B.

Conclusion: Combining structured sparsity and quantization enables efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the flexible FPGA accelerator supports broader sparsity patterns beyond fixed hardware limits.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.

*Haley Rosso,Talea Mayo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews diffusion models for simulation-based inference, explaining core concepts, highlighting their robustness, and exploring their advantages and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional likelihood-based techniques fail for complex simulations with intractable likelihoods. Diffusion models offer likelihood-free methods to infer posterior distributions directly from simulation samples.

Method: The paper explains diffusion modeling fundamentals like forward noising, reverse-time dynamics, and score matching, detailing their application to conditional scores for posterior sampling. It synthesizes methods addressing challenges in scientific data and compares diffusion models to normalizing flows.

Result: It reviews the effectiveness of diffusion models in addressing issues like model misspecifications, unstructured data, and missing observations, highlighting robustness in scientific simulations.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based SBI has significant potential for addressing challenges in scientific data inference. However, trade-offs like iterative sampling remain, and open problems need further exploration, particularly for fields like geophysics.

Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.

*Amin Sadri,M Maruf Hossain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM²), a model enabling human-level concept learning with one-shot classification, focusing on document structures for robust and efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models require extensive samples to learn concepts, unlike humans who only need one, due to the subconscious identification of key features. The paper aims to bridge this gap with a more sustainable and effective solution.

Method: The CM² model identifies structural 'important features' of documents akin to human assessment and classifies documents using one sample per class. It avoids energy-intensive architectures by working as a 'Green AI' with minimal computational requirements.

Result: CM² outperforms both traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness with one-shot learning while using lower energy and CPU-based setups.

Conclusion: CM² represents a scalable, efficient, and environmentally friendly approach to achieving human-level one-shot learning, tailored for applications demanding low computation and inherent explainability.

Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3. Green AI and environmental sustainability 4. Optimized for CPU-only environments 5. Inherent explainability (glass-box model) 6. Faster computation and low latency 7. Robustness against unbalanced classes 8. Economic viability 9. Generic, expandable, and extendable

### [219] [Geometric Scaling of Bayesian Inference in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23752)
*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines how production-grade language models maintain a specific geometric structure related to Bayesian inference and how this structure impacts uncertainty and predictive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand whether the geometric structure observed in smaller, synthetic settings for Bayesian inference persists in larger, more complex language models.

Method: Analysis was conducted on several language models (Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families) to investigate their last-layer value representations. Experiments included targeted interventions on specific axes of these representations during in-context learning.

Result: Geometric structures aligned with Bayesian inference were found in all tested models. Manipulating these structures affects uncertainty geometry but not necessarily the overall Bayesian-like behavior.

Conclusion: Modern language models encode and utilize geometric substrates indicative of Bayesian inference, though these structures act as readouts of uncertainty, not as critical computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.

### [220] [Generalized Regularized Evidential Deep Learning Models: Theory and Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23753)
*Deep Shankar Pandey,Hyomin Choi,Qi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of learning freeze caused by non-negative evidential activation functions in evidential deep learning (EDL) models, proposing a new family of activation functions and regularizers to enable consistent updates and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues in evidential deep learning, specifically learning freeze caused by non-negative evidential activation functions, which hinder efficient uncertainty-aware learning.

Method: A theoretical analysis of different evidential activation functions is conducted, leading to the design of a novel family of activation functions and evidential regularizers that allow for consistent evidence updates. These methods are validated experimentally on various benchmarks.

Result: The developed activation functions and regularizers successfully address the learning freeze issue, demonstrating improved performance and effectiveness across multiple benchmark tasks and applications, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, few-shot classification, and blind face restoration.

Conclusion: The paper offers a significant advancement in evidential deep learning by overcoming limitations of existing activation functions, providing a general and improved framework for uncertainty-aware learning with convincing empirical support.

Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.

### [221] [Generalising E-prop to Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24506)
*Beren Millidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to train deep recurrent networks without relying on Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), by extending the E-prop framework for multi-layered networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPTT is biologically implausible and computationally inefficient for large networks, while RTRL, though plausible, is impractical due to high computational cost. The study seeks to overcome these limitations with an alternative approach that works in deep recurrent networks.

Method: The authors generalized the E-prop framework, introducing a novel recursion relationship across network depth to enable online learning using eligibility traces across both time and depth.

Result: The proposed online learning algorithm effectively achieves accurate credit assignment in both depth and time for deep recurrent networks.

Conclusion: This framework enables deep recurrent networks to be trained without BPTT while maintaining computational efficiency and biological plausibility.

Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.

*Sheo Yon Jhin,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINTS is a self-supervised learning model that extracts human factors from time series residuals, improving forecasting accuracy without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of data dependency costs in financial, computational, and practical aspects by extracting latent human factors directly from time series data.

Method: A self-supervised framework called HINTS uses the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model to model social influence, memory, and bias, integrating these factors into forecasting models through attention mechanisms.

Result: HINTS improves forecasting accuracy across nine datasets and demonstrates interpretability through case studies that align extracted factors with real-world events.

Conclusion: HINTS successfully models human factors endogenously within time series forecasting while offering practical, interpretable insights without reliance on external data sources.

Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.

### [223] [Learning Coupled System Dynamics under Incomplete Physical Constraints and Missing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23761)
*Esha Saha,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSIC, a multitask learning framework, addressing challenges in modeling partially observed coupled systems with missing physical constraints or incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with modeling systems where governing equations are partially missing or data is incomplete, limiting their ability to handle complex real-world systems.

Method: MUSIC uses a sparsity-induced multitask neural network framework, integrating partial physical constraints with data-driven learning. It employs mesh-free sampling and sparsity regularization to efficiently model coupled systems.

Result: MUSIC achieves accurate results for complex systems with scarce and noisy data, outperforming non-sparse formulations.

Conclusion: MUSIC is a robust and efficient solution for modeling coupled systems with incomplete observations and partially known physical laws.

Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised learning (SSL) based method to perform neural architecture search (NAS) for multimodal deep neural networks (DNNs) without requiring labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of substantial labeled data requirements in NAS for multimodal DNNs, which have complex structures.

Method: The authors propose employing SSL for both the architecture search and model pretraining phases, enabling the design of DNNs using only unlabeled data.

Result: The proposed SSL method successfully designed multimodal DNN architectures from unlabeled training data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging SSL allows effective architecture search for multimodal DNNs without the dependence on labeled datasets, broadening the applicability of NAS methods in data-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

*Karim Salta,Michael Kirby,Chris Peterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a clustering algorithm using geometric representatives on Grassmann or flag manifolds, introducing a trainable prototype - Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clustering accuracy and purity for datasets represented as subspaces while maintaining mathematical structure for analysis.

Method: The method involves replacing traditional subspace means with SVBF prototypes in clustering pipelines, particularly integrating it within the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) framework.

Result: The algorithm achieves better cluster purity across various datasets including synthetic data, images, spectral, and video action data.

Conclusion: SVBF-LBG provides a more effective clustering approach by leveraging subspace geometry, producing better purity and preserving the mathematical framework for analysis.

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel methodology to evaluate and benchmark the stability of datasets used in network traffic classification, addressing the issue of data or concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in network traffic classification, particularly the degradation of ML model performance due to concept drift and the instability of datasets caused by the rapid evolution of computer networks.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on concept drift detection that incorporates ML feature weights to enhance detection accuracy. They also present a stability benchmarking workflow to assess dataset robustness.

Result: The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. It highlights dataset stability issues and weak points, providing actionable insights for future optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully benchmarks dataset stability and demonstrates its optimization impact, offering a practical solution to ensure reliable network traffic classification in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency and computational challenges in classical methods involving bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization for experimental design in inverse problems.

Method: NODE jointly optimizes a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of design variables within a single optimization loop. It focuses on direct optimization of measurement locations, ensuring sparsity by design, thereby bypassing l1 tuning.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks, including exponential growth, MNIST sampling, and sparse view X-ray CT, show that NODE outperforms baseline approaches in terms of improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

Conclusion: NODE offers a computationally efficient, sparsity-enforcing framework with superior performance for inverse problem experimental design, offering improvements in accuracy and practical applicability.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

*Alexander C. Li,Ananya Kumar,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Discriminative classifiers often fail under slight distribution shifts due to spurious feature reliance. Generative classifiers mitigate this issue by modeling all features and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while reducing spurious correlation impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of discriminative classifiers under distribution shifts caused by spurious feature reliance.

Method: Employ generative classifiers (based on diffusion and autoregressive models) that model all features and avoid reliance on spurious correlations, trained without the need for specialized regularization or augmentations.

Result: Generative classifiers showed state-of-the-art performance on five image and text benchmarks, demonstrating robustness against spurious correlations and practical effectiveness in applications like medical or satellite datasets.

Conclusion: Generative classifiers are a promising alternative to discriminative ones, especially in scenarios with spurious correlations and distribution shifts, offering better generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a security framework, ZTA-FL, designed for IIoT using zero trust principles, achieving high intrusion detection and robustness under attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the urgent need to address security gaps in Industrial IoT infrastructure against threats like Byzantine poisoning and weak agent authentication.

Method: The method involves employing TPM-based cryptographic attestation, SHAP-weighted aggregation for theoretical guarantees, and privacy-preserving adversarial training.

Result: ZTA-FL achieved 97.8% detection accuracy, 93.2% accuracy during Byzantine attacks, 89.3% robustness under adversarial conditions, and reduced communication costs by 34%.

Conclusion: The proposed ZTA-FL framework enhances security and reliability in IIoT intrusion detection, showing superior performance compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent. We provide theoretical analysis, failure mode characterization, and release code for reproducibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CENNSurv, a deep learning model for analyzing cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes, offering interpretability and scalability over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to resolve challenges in cumulative effect modeling using time-dependent data, as conventional methods are computationally intensive and lack interpretability for large datasets.

Method: Development of CENNSurv, a deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships in time-dependent survival data, tested on real-world datasets.

Result: CENNSurv identified lagged associations and short-term behavior shifts in two case studies, demonstrating its ability to handle complex temporal patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable and interpretable tool for researchers to study dynamic cumulative exposure effects in epidemiology and other fields.

Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.

*Xusheng Zhang,Tuan Nguyen,Ting He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized design for mixing matrices in decentralized federated learning to minimize maximum per-node energy consumption while considering the wireless communication context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies focus on minimizing communication time in mixing matrices, but ignore the critical aspect of minimizing per-node energy consumption, especially for energy-limited devices.

Method: The authors propose a multi-phase, theoretically-justified design framework leveraging time-varying communication topologies to optimize energy budgets and balance energy consumption, supported by a novel convergence theorem.

Result: The approach achieves a trade-off between energy efficiency and convergence rate by using sparse and dense mixing matrices, validated by evaluations on real data.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively minimizes energy consumption in decentralized federated learning while maintaining convergence efficiency in wireless networks.

Abstract: We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.

Conclusion: SB-TRPO offers a robust approach to hard-constrained RL, combining adaptability, safety assurance, and competitive reward performance, making it effective for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [233] [FineFT: Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23773)
*Molei Qin,Xinyu Cai,Yewen Li,Haochong Xia,Chuqiao Zong,Shuo Sun,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops FineFT, a new reinforcement learning framework, to tackle challenges in crypto futures trading with high leverage, focusing on stability, profitability, and risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods for quantitative tasks fall short in the futures market due to high-leverage risks that amplify reward fluctuations and expose models to significant loss during unforeseen market conditions.

Method: The authors propose FineFT, a three-stage ensemble RL framework. Stage I uses selective ensemble Q learner updates for stability, Stage II employs VAEs to identify capability boundaries, and Stage III dynamically selects policies to manage risk and ensure profitability in changing market states.

Result: FineFT outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving higher profitability. Experiments confirm its ability to adapt to distinct market dynamics and enhance convergence and risk mitigation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed FineFT framework effectively addresses the challenges of trading in highly leveraged crypto futures markets, offering a risk-aware and highly profitable solution with specialized agent roles and VAE-guided decision-making.

Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.

Motivation: High-quality labeled data and trial-and-error learning in machine learning are expensive and risky in real-world, large-scale, or high-stakes situations. Interactive learning actively guides data collection and decision-making.

Method: Developing algorithms that optimize active learning, sequential decision making, and model selection under partial feedback, achieving computational efficiency and minimizing resource use.

Result: First efficient active learning methods for exponential label savings, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms independent of action space size, and optimal cost characterizations in model selection.

Conclusion: This work provides statistically optimal and computationally efficient algorithms, enhancing interactive learning's theoretical underpinnings and practical application in large-scale settings.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.

### [236] [Improved Balanced Classification with Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23947)
*Corinna Cortes,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates effective surrogate loss functions for addressing class imbalance in multi-class classification. It introduces and comprehensively analyzes Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) and Generalized Class-Aware (GCA) loss families, proving their theoretical robustness and empirically demonstrating their superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address class imbalance in multi-class classification, ensuring fairness and preventing the minority classes from being neglected. The traditional balanced loss poses intractability issues, hence, the need for more effective surrogate loss functions.

Method: The authors propose two surrogate loss families: GLA losses, which generalize Logit-Adjusted losses by including class priors in cross-entropy loss, and GCA losses, which extend class-weighted losses by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins. Both families were analyzed theoretically for consistency and experimentally evaluated.

Result: The paper presents theoretical proofs of Bayes-consistency and $H$-consistency for GLA and GCA losses, with GCA showing stronger consistency guarantees in imbalanced settings. Empirical results demonstrate that GLA and GCA losses significantly outperform naive class-weighted and Logit-Adjusted loss approaches, with GLA being better in general scenarios and GCA excelling in highly imbalanced cases.

Conclusion: GLA and GCA loss families are highly effective surrogate losses for dealing with class imbalance in multi-class classification. GLA has a slight advantage in more typical benchmarks, while GCA performs better in cases of extreme class imbalance, providing strong theoretical and practical insights for classification tasks.

Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.

### [238] [Assured Autonomy: How Operations Research Powers and Orchestrates Generative AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23978)
*Tinglong Dai,David Simchi-Levi,Michelle Xiao Wu,Yao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses generative AI's shift towards autonomous systems and proposes a framework for 'assured autonomy' to address challenges like operational fragility using operations research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI systems are gaining more independence, requiring greater safeguards against failures in operational workflows to ensure feasibility, robustness, and safety.

Method: Two approaches are presented: flow-based generative models using ordinary differential equations for auditability and adversarial robustness frameworks for stress testing decision rules.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates how autonomy reshapes operations research roles toward architecting safe and reliable systems.

Conclusion: A new research agenda is outlined to ensure autonomy is accompanied by structured control, robust safety measures, and effective monitoring in critical domains.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates private and robust alignment of language models through theoretical upper bounds in offline and online settings under privacy constraints and adversarial corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical performance of language model alignment under privacy constraints and adversarial corruption, ensuring robustness and accuracy in practical applications.

Method: The authors establish upper bounds using theoretical analysis, study privacy-corruption interplays, and derive convergence guarantees using log loss and square loss algorithms.

Result: They demonstrate near-optimal rates in privacy-only settings, improved guarantees for joint privacy-and-corruption settings, and provide new results for private and robust online alignment.

Conclusion: The findings yield deeper insights into achieving private and robust language model alignment, with broad applicability in learning theory and statistics.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.

*Mahdi Karami,Ali Behrouz,Peilin Zhong,Razvan Pascanu,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-scale state-space model (MS-SSM) to address limitations of traditional SSMs in capturing multi-scale dependencies and improving memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional state-space models face challenges like limited memory efficiency and an inability to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies, both of which are vital for tasks involving complex and hierarchical structures.

Method: The authors introduce a multi-scale SSM framework that models sequence dynamics at various resolutions, incorporating an input-dependent scale-mixer to dynamically merge information across scales.

Result: MS-SSM significantly enhances sequence modeling efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing SSM-based models across tasks such as time series classification, hierarchical reasoning, and image recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: MS-SSM improves state-space modeling by addressing memory and multi-scale dependency issues, offering a computationally efficient solution for various sequential and long-range tasks.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.

*Udit Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a paired seed evaluation design to reduce variance and improve statistical power in machine learning simulations by utilizing shared randomness across alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of machine learning systems often suffers from high variance due to random initialization and learning stochasticity, complicating comparative analysis.

Method: The authors propose a paired seed evaluation design, wherein competing systems are assessed under identical random seeds, inducing correlation and reducing variance in outcomes.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, leading to significant efficiency gains, tighter confidence intervals, and higher statistical power.

Conclusion: Paired seed evaluation outperforms standard independent evaluation methods by improving reliability and is still valid even when correlation is absent, offering universally better evaluation practices.

Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.

TL;DR: Bridge-TS introduces an improved approach for time series imputation by designing informative priors for generative models using expert and compositional priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of generative models in time series imputation, which struggle with burdened generation processes and imputation accuracy due to uninformed priors.

Method: Bridge-TS uses expert priors, involving pretrained transformer models for deterministic estimations, and compositional priors, which integrate multiple pretrained models for enhanced data-to-data generation.

Result: Experiments using datasets like ETT, Exchange, and Weather established Bridge-TS as superior in imputation accuracy according to mean square error and mean absolute error metrics.

Conclusion: Bridge-TS proves the effectiveness of leveraging improved informational priors in generative time series imputation, setting a new benchmark in accuracy.

Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformers face challenges due to their quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache, limiting their scalability, particularly for long-context tasks.

Method: Trellis employs a fixed-size memory with a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism and online gradient descent with a forget gate to dynamically compress and retain key-value data at test time.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Trellis’s superior performance over strong baselines across tasks like language modeling, time series, and recall-intensive tasks, with increasing gains for longer sequences.

Conclusion: Trellis improves computational scalability and contextual information retention for Transformers, making it well-suited for long-context applications.

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

Result: The proposed model surpasses previous state-of-the-art NP methods on benchmarks like 1D Gaussian processes, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

Conclusion: The introduced NP model combines simplicity, flexibility, and performance benefits, offering better accuracy and efficient sampling compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification, using methods like Lasso, SCAD, and MCP penalties to improve feature recovery and prediction error. A proximal gradient algorithm is proposed for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional datasets require sparse regularization for effective feature prediction and selection, especially in weak-supervision settings like Pconf classification, which only uses positive samples with confidence scores.

Method: The paper proposes convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalization frameworks tailored to high-dimensional Pconf learning problems. Estimation and prediction error bounds are theoretically established, and a proximal gradient algorithm is developed for optimization.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed methods achieve predictive accuracy and feature selection on par with supervised approaches, addressing high-dimensional challenges in weakly-supervised learning.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse-penalization framework successfully bridges the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics, offering near-minimax optimal recovery rates and efficient methods for Pconf classification.

Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates embedding methods for financial sentiment in limited data contexts, highlighting the insufficiency of embeddings alone in overcoming data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in applying NLP techniques to financial sentiment analysis, especially with small datasets.

Method: It compares Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer embeddings combined with gradient boosting, evaluating them on manually-labeled financial headlines.

Result: The study finds models underperform trivial baselines due to small datasets, causing overfitting and diminishing returns with pretrained embeddings.

Conclusion: Data scarcity limits embedding effectiveness in financial sentiment analysis. Alternative methods like few-shot learning or data augmentation are recommended.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.

Result: The Infini-attention model showed stable training and surpassed the baseline in long-context retrieval. It achieved up to 31% higher accuracy at 16,384-token contexts compared to the baseline, despite some performance degradation in repeated memory compressions.

Conclusion: Infini-attention is effective in compensating for SLM's limited parameters and shows potential for improving long-context capabilities in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Yoshihiko Fujisawa,Yudai Fujimoto,Akira Sakai,Katsuki Fujisawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDBF (Multi-envelope DBF) for extremely low-bit quantization of large language models, achieving better accuracy and performance than previous methods without exceeding memory limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in Double Binary Factorization (DBF) for LLMs, specifically the restrictive scaling parameters that hinder accuracy and performance.

Method: The proposed MDBF shares 1-bit sign bases across components but replaces the single envelope with a rank-l envelope. It also employs closed-form initialization and alternating refinement to optimize parameters.

Result: MDBF showed improved perplexity and zero-shot accuracy on LLaMA and Qwen families compared to prior binary formats, using the same bits per weight.

Conclusion: MDBF achieves better expressiveness, accuracy, and efficiency than conventional DBF while being deployable with an inference-friendly design.

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

*Yuyang Zhang,Yang Hu,Bo Dai,Na Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced SAC algorithm using flow-based models for more expressive and robust energy-based policies, combined with a new policy update mechanism called ISFM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SAC algorithms use simple policy classes for efficiency, which limits their expressiveness and robustness. The paper aims to improve these aspects.

Method: A modified SAC algorithm utilizing flow-based models for policies. It introduces ISFM, an online flow-matching technique for efficient policy updates using samples from specified distributions.

Result: The algorithm is theoretically analyzed regarding sampling distributions' effects on learning efficiency and validated through experiments on max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively learns optimal action distributions, showing enhanced expressiveness and robust policy performance.

Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for reliable, short-term forecasting of solar energy to handle its variability in power grids effectively.

Method: It uses NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to benchmark deep learning models like LSTM, Transformer, and newer architectures for GHI forecasting. SHAP analysis is applied to understand temporal reasoning, and Knowledge Distillation is explored for model compression.

Result: The Transformer outperforms other architectures with an R^2 of 0.9696. SHAP analysis highlights models' temporal reasoning differences. Knowledge Distillation compresses the Transformer by 23.5%, reducing error.

Conclusion: Transformers provide superior GHI prediction and can be compressed for deployment on edge devices without sacrificing accuracy, aiding renewable energy integration into power grids.

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is essential for mitigating the variability of solar energy in power grids. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong "recency bias" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.

*Peter Farag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured alternative to dense linear layers, offering computational efficiency and improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense linear layers are computationally expensive and misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations.

Method: SPM replaces dense matrices with sparse, pairwise-mixing stages, enabling efficient global linear transformations and integrating compositional inductive bias.

Result: Experiments show reduced computational costs, improved accuracy on structured tasks, and competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPM provides a viable drop-in replacement for dense layers, optimizing efficiency and generalization in machine learning models.

Abstract: Dense linear layers are a dominant source of computational and parametric cost in modern machine learning models, despite their quadratic complexity and often being misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations. We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure. We present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating substantial reductions in wall-clock cost and improved accuracy on structured learning problems, while retaining competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

### [253] [Constraint Breeds Generalization: Temporal Dynamics as an Inductive Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23916)
*Xia Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how dynamical constraints in neural networks can enhance generalization by leveraging temporal inductive biases, contrasting this with conventional static architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between unconstrained conventional deep learning and biological systems operating under metabolic constraints, and to explore how these constraints might serve as a beneficial inductive bias for generalization.

Method: The authors conduct a phase-space analysis of signal propagation to identify a fundamental asymmetry in dynamics. They experiment with architectures capable of temporal integration, evaluating performance across multiple domains (classification, reconstruction, reinforcement learning) in different dynamical regimes.

Result: Results show that dynamical properties, especially a 'critical transition' regime, optimize generalization capabilities, outperforming static architectures in leveraging temporal structures.

Conclusion: Dynamical constraints act as a novel type of inductive bias that can enhance generalization, suggesting the importance of incorporating temporal dynamics in artificial intelligence development.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.

*Kacem Khaled,Felipe Gohring de Magalhães,Gabriela Nicolescu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantized models are vulnerable to extraction attacks, and existing defenses are inadequate for edge devices. DivQAT incorporates extraction attack defenses directly within quantization-aware training, enhancing the robustness of CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extraction attacks can lead to intellectual property theft of CNNs, and quantized models lack sufficient defenses while being crucial for edge devices and efficiency.

Method: Introduces DivQAT, a Quantization Aware Training algorithm that integrates model extraction defenses directly into the quantization process of CNNs.

Result: Empirical validation on benchmark datasets shows DivQAT effectively defends against model extraction attacks while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: DivQAT offers a promising solution to improve the security of quantized models, especially in edge devices, by integrating defenses within the training process and enhancing overall model robustness.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based flood models are accurate but computationally expensive, necessitating faster methods that can handle unstructured spatial domains.

Method: It introduces DUALFloodGNN, embedding global and local physical constraints, with a message-passing framework and dynamic curriculum learning for multi-step autoregressive inference.

Result: DUALFloodGNN outperforms typical GNNs and state-of-the-art flood models in predicting hydrologic variables and is computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The model provides an innovative approach to flood prediction that balances accuracy and efficiency, offering improvements in hydrodynamics forecasting.

Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency.

*Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DataFlow is a framework designed to build, test, and deploy machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data efficiently, bridging the gap between batch processing and streaming systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional workflows struggle with causality violations, batch artifacts, and reproducibility challenges when scaling machine learning systems from batch prototypes to real-time streaming systems.

Method: DataFlow uses a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency, enforcing causality and enabling seamless transition between batch mode and streaming production.

Result: DataFlow is flexible, integrates with Python, and improves performance through DAG scheduling, supporting applications like financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

Conclusion: The framework resolves batch-to-streaming system challenges and helps deploy identical machine learning models across varying temporal and feature dimensions with minimal reengineering.

Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

### [257] [Information-Theoretic Quality Metric of Low-Dimensional Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23981)
*Sebastián Gutiérrez-Bernal,Hector Medel Cobaxin,Abiel Galindo González*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel metric, ERPM, for assessing information preservation in low-dimensional embeddings, complementing existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to directly assess information preservation in dimensionality reduction, leaving gaps in evaluating embeddings in information-sensitive applications.

Method: The method introduces ERPM, utilizing Shannon entropy and stable rank to quantify uncertainty changes and comparing results with Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE) and Local Procrustes.

Result: ERPM correlates well with Local Procrustes but differs in local regimes. It reveals severe information loss in certain areas, unlike distance-based metrics.

Conclusion: ERPM effectively identifies neighborhoods with information loss, providing a comprehensive tool for evaluating embedding quality, especially for sensitive applications.

Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLEAR-HUG, a framework for improved representation learning in ECG analysis, addressing limitations in existing methods and aligning with diagnostic guidelines. CLEAR reconstructs heartbeat signals using sparse attention, while HUG employs hierarchical modeling for disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of earlier ECG self-supervised learning methods that overlook subtle physiological variations and fail to align representation learning with clinical diagnostic guidelines.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage framework. Stage 1: CLEAR reconstructs signals by treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity using sparse attention. Stage 2: HUG performs disease diagnosis through hierarchical modeling, mimicking diagnostic guidelines.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate a 6.84% improvement across six ECG-related tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG in boosting representation learning for cardiac conduction patterns.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HUG enhances ECG analysis by capturing both subtle variations and general commonalities in cardiac conduction across leads, while adhering to clinical diagnostic practices, making it impactful for healthcare applications.

Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperGRL, a framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning, achieving stability and superior performance by removing the need for complex sampling and hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRL methods encounter challenges due to reliance on contrastive objectives, complex architectures, and hyperparameter tuning, leading to issues like over-smoothing and training instability.

Method: HyperGRL uses two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity, harnessing hyperspherical embeddings along with adaptive balancing for stable training.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperGRL improves representation quality and generalization, with enhancements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% in key tasks over the strongest methods.

Conclusion: HyperGRL offers an effective and geometrically grounded solution for graph representation learning, highlighting the benefits of sampling-free, stable training designs.

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the divergence in generalization between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning in large language models (LLMs) by introducing a granular benchmark to analyze reasoning core skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why reinforcement learning preserves generalization in LLMs while supervised fine-tuning often narrows it.

Method: A new benchmark is introduced to decompose reasoning into atomic core skills (e.g., calculation, simulation, diagnostic), assessing their evolution under SFT and RL. Meta-probing studies model behavior across training stages alongside low-level metrics.

Result: Reinforcement-learning-tuned models exhibit more stable reasoning capabilities and resist skill collapse. In contrast, supervised fine-tuned models show sharper behavioral drifts and overfitting tendencies.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of reasoning in LLMs and recommends strategies for designing training approaches that promote robust, generalizable cognitive abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework using Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI) combines physics-inspired features with deep learning methods to improve lane-change intention predictions across different highway scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting lane-change intentions is crucial for autonomous driving safety, but challenges such as noisy data, class imbalance, and scenario generalization complicate this task.

Method: The authors use a two-layer Bi-LSTM encoder to extract temporal embeddings from vehicle trajectories, merge them with physics-informed features, and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class predictions while applying imbalance-aware techniques for better reliability.

Result: TPI-AI surpasses standalone models in macro-F1 scores across two datasets (highD, exiD) and prediction horizons, indicating superior performance and generalization.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal deep learning with physics-based interaction rules enhances lane-change intention prediction, making it robust across varied highway scenarios.

Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.

TL;DR: This paper performs an ablation study analyzing latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, comparing latent autoregressive dynamics, non-autoregressive models, and token-level autoregression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the role of latent autoregression in enhancing representational structure and stability in GP-VAE models and compare its performance against alternative structures.

Method: The authors perform a systematic comparison of three configurations: full GP-VAE with latent autoregression, a non-autoregressive latent structure, and a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer.

Result: Latent autoregression improves compatibility with Gaussian-process priors and ensures greater long-term stability. Non-autoregressive configurations result in degraded latent structures and instability.

Conclusion: Latent autoregression effectively organizes long-range structure and complements token-level autoregressive modeling, providing insights into representational structure without proposing a new architecture.

Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.

Motivation: The research aims to enhance the performance of LLMs by leveraging their intrinsic self-critique capabilities, challenging the skepticism regarding its effectiveness and striving for state-of-the-art results in planning benchmarks.

Method: The authors use a few-shot learning approach, extending it to many-shot gradually, and employ an iterative correction and refinement process for intrinsic self-critique without relying on external verifiers.

Result: The approach achieved state-of-the-art results, with significant performance improvements on Blocksworld, Logistics, and Mini-grid planning datasets, exceeding baseline accuracies.

Conclusion: Self-critique proves effective for intrinsic model enhancement regardless of the specific LLM version, potentially unlocking better performance with more complex models and techniques in the future.

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.

*Advait Gadhikar,Riccardo Grazzi,James Hensman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ methods to improve weight and activation quantization in Large Language Models by addressing outliers through rotation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have difficulty being quantized due to the outliers in weights and activations, requiring new methods to address this issue effectively.

Method: The paper proposes OptRot, which minimizes the fourth power of rotated weights, and a data-dependent approach OptRot$^{+}$, incorporating activation covariance to improve quantization processes.

Result: OptRot outperforms existing methods like Hadamard rotations and SpinQuant for weight quantization, while OptRot$^{+}$ boosts performance further through data dependency. However, both show limitations in W4A4 settings.

Conclusion: OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ methods provide effective solutions for quantization challenges in LLMs, particularly for weights, though activation quantization involves trade-offs depending on the settings.

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GARDO, a new framework, addresses challenges in fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL), aiming to mitigate reward hacking while enhancing text-to-image alignment and generation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning diffusion models for text-to-image alignment is often hindered by the mismatch between proxy rewards used in optimization and the true goal, leading to reward hacking, reduced image quality, and collapsed diversity.

Method: GARDO introduces selective penalization of samples with high uncertainty, adaptive regularization by periodically updating the reference model, and amplifies rewards for diverse, high-quality samples, ensuring better mode coverage and exploration.

Result: Experiments show GARDO consistently mitigates reward hacking and enhances diversity in generation without reducing sample efficiency or exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: GARDO proves effective and robust in improving text-to-image diffusion models, balancing exploration, sample efficiency, and diversity without succumbing to reward hacking.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in achieving reliable conditional coverage in conformal prediction by refining quantile regression techniques, ultimately improving performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the reliability of conformal prediction, particularly for conditional coverage, which has been challenging to achieve due to finite sample constraints.

Method: The authors refine quantile regression using a sharp surrogate objective based on Taylor expansion. They propose a three-headed quantile network to estimate weights via finite differences and optimize a density-weighted pinball loss to improve conditional coverage.

Result: Through a theoretical analysis and experiments on high-dimensional datasets, the method showed significant improvements in conditional coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed technique successfully enhances conformal prediction methods by improving conditional coverage while maintaining robust theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-α\pm δ\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.

*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new cost-effective Monte Carlo framework with neural network surrogates is proposed for uncertainty quantification in plasma kinetic equations' VPL system, effectively reducing computational demands while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods struggle with the costs and challenges of uncertainty quantification in plasma kinetic equations, due to high-dimensionality, multiscale stiffness, and nonlocal collisional integrations.

Method: The approach integrates a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework using a high-fidelity VPL solver coupled with physics-informed neural network surrogates, reducing computational complexity through an anisotropic micro-macro tensor decomposition.

Result: The method achieved variance reduction, increased computational efficiency, and accurate simulation statistics with fewer high-fidelity samples and reduced computational time.

Conclusion: The introduced framework provides an efficient, robust solution for UQ in high-dimensional plasma kinetic equations, overcoming traditional computational limitations while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MSACL, an RL framework combining exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL for stability and safety, evaluated effectively across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving provable stability and safety in model-free RL while simplifying reward design and improving robustness.

Method: Uses multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning with ESL, $λ$-weighted aggregation, and stability-aware advantage functions for policy optimization.

Result: MSACL outperforms state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms, achieving exponential stability, faster convergence, robustness to uncertainties, and generalization to unseen paths.

Conclusion: MSACL establishes a framework for safe, stability-guaranteed RL by leveraging Lyapunov theory in off-policy actor-critic methods, offering practical tools for robust control.

Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: This study focuses on early sepsis prediction using novel machine learning models analyzed on wearable heart rate data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of approaches for sepsis early detection in non-ward settings, a critical need given the significant mortality and costs associated with sepsis.

Method: Four machine learning algorithms were developed and optimized using a genetic algorithm to analyze heart rate data from wearable devices. Prediction windows were extended via transfer learning.

Result: The models demonstrated feasibility for wearable device implementation, achieving promising performance metrics for early sepsis detection up to four hours in advance.

Conclusion: The study shows the potential of using wearable heart rate monitoring devices in improving early sepsis detection outside traditional healthcare settings.

Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SaM2B, a framework for low-altitude UAV communication using reliability-aware, dynamic multi-modal beam prediction, achieving superior results over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dynamic and fluctuating importance of modalities in UAV communications and overcome limitations of static weighting and modal misalignments.

Method: A reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme is integrated into a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework (SaM2B), which uses environmental, posture, and geospatial data, along with cross-modal contrastive learning for improved robustness.

Result: Experiments on UAV datasets demonstrate that SaM2B significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in achieving reliable connectivity for UAV communication.

Conclusion: The reliability-aware and semantic-driven approach of SaM2B enhances robustness, generalization, and adaptability in multi-modal beam prediction for UAVs.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.

*Rodrigo Pereira David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation for efficient and reliable Bayesian inference in neural networks, addressing challenges in highly anisotropic and curved loss surfaces of modern deep models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian inference in neural networks is hindered by anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups, making traditional Euclidean approximations ineffective.

Method: The TRL approximation models the posterior as a probabilistic tube using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to handle tangential and transverse uncertainties in the parameter space.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets shows improved calibration reliability comparable to Deep Ensembles but at just 1/5 of their computational cost.

Conclusion: TRL provides a scalable and efficient alternative for single-model Bayesian inference, bridging the gap between computational efficiency and ensemble-level calibration reliability.

Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViReLoc, a framework for spatial reasoning and localization based on visual data rather than text, achieving improved performance without relying on real-time GPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of current reasoning systems, which rely heavily on textual information, making them ineffective for spatial tasks such as navigation and geo-localization.

Method: The authors propose ViReLoc, a framework that uses visual reasoning to plan and localize routes by leveraging visual representations, reinforcement learning, contrastive learning, and adaptive feature interaction.

Result: ViReLoc demonstrates consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross-view retrieval in diverse navigation and localization scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings show that visual reasoning can serve as a robust complementary method for navigation and localization tasks while eliminating the need for dependence on GPS, offering more secure solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods lack guarantees for valid statistical inference, and traditional DDC models impose restrictive parametric assumptions, limiting flexibility and computational feasibility.

Method: The authors introduce debiased inference techniques using semiparametric methods, leveraging pathwise differentiability and efficient influence functions. They integrate machine learning for nuisance component estimation while maintaining rigorous statistical properties.

Result: This framework provides $csqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency, enabling valid inference in nonparametric reward models for IRL and DDC.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between flexible nonparametric models and classical parametric inference techniques, offering a robust and computationally feasible approach to IRL and DDC analysis.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly focuses on error evolution dynamics, improving reliability and adaptability in learning systems used in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues like instability, slow convergence, and brittle adaptation in learning systems exposed to nonstationary, safety-critical environments.

Method: The authors propose a framework that decomposes error signals into bias, noise, and alignment components. The framework computes these diagnostics online using lightweight statistics independent of model architecture or domain.

Result: The proposed decomposition is applied to supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers, offering a unifying framework. Stability and bounded updates are theoretically established, and the approach improves modulation of adaptation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of error evolution for adaptive learning and offers an interpretable, unified foundation for enhancing learning reliability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

*Patrick Wyrod,Ashesh Chattopadhyay,Daniele Venturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a joint generative modeling approach for forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, improving both short-term predictions and long-term statistical accuracy compared to existing conditional prediction models. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions and contain complex multiscale processes, limiting traditional deterministic forecasting. The study aims to provide a generative model capable of addressing these challenges.

Method: The paper reframes forecasting as learning the joint probability distribution of system states over short temporal windows, marginalizing these distributions for forecasts. It also proposes a model-agnostic framework for training and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The proposed method improves short-term predictive ability, preserves attractor geometry, and provides better long-term statistical behavior when applied to chaotic systems like the Lorenz-63 system and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

Conclusion: Joint generative models capture nonlinear dynamics effectively, outperforming traditional next-step models in terms of predictive skill and statistical reliability for chaotic systems.

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.

*Hyunjun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOLOGRAPH, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with sheaf theory for causal discovery, addressing challenges of identifiability in observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for causal discovery using LLMs lack rigorous theoretical grounding and struggle with identifiability in observational data.

Method: HOLOGRAPH formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery using sheaf theory. It represents local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf and employs Algebraic Latent Projection for hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent for optimization.

Result: HOLOGRAPH shows competitive performance on causal discovery tasks (50-100 variables) and unveils new mathematical insights, such as the failure of the Locality axiom in larger graphs.

Conclusion: HOLOGRAPH offers a principled, mathematically robust framework for LLM-guided causal discovery, albeit with identified limitations in larger graph structures.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the reliability of small-scale proxy model experiments in AI and proposes a new evaluation protocol to improve data recipe assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limited understanding of whether small-scale model experiments reliably predict outcomes for full-scale AI model training, especially given inconsistencies caused by fixed training configurations.

Method: The authors introduce a modified evaluation protocol that employs reduced learning rates during small-scale proxy model training, reducing the cost of hyperparameter tuning while preserving reliable dataset rankings.

Result: Theoretical proof is provided that the new approach preserves dataset rankings, and empirical validation across 23 data recipes demonstrates significant reliability improvements compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Using reduced learning rates in proxy model training improves the reliability of data recipe assessments and aligns small-scale experiments more closely with large-scale model outcomes.

Abstract: Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of "fair" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.

Method: HUMOR uses a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for reasoning and anchors this reasoning to high-quality paths while employing a pairwise reward model for subjective humor alignment within meme template groups.

Result: Experiments show HUMOR improves reasoning diversity, better preference alignment, and higher meme quality in VLMs, effectively enhancing multimodal generation tasks.

Conclusion: Through hierarchical reasoning and preference alignment, HUMOR demonstrates it can advance human-aligned multimodal generation, highlighting its potential for tasks beyond memes.

Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.

### [279] [CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564)
*Shunbo Jia,Caizhi Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR) to enhance robustness of ECG diagnosis models against adversarial perturbations, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current defenses against adversarial perturbations in ECG diagnostic models, which are computationally demanding or introduce latency, thereby compromising clinical application.

Method: The approach, CPR, incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior and a Structural Causal Model to disentangle pathological features from non-causal artifacts in ECG data.

Result: CPR outperformed traditional methods, achieving higher robustness (F1 score of 0.632) against Smooth Adversarial Perturbations, with better efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: CPR provides a practical and efficient solution for robust ECG diagnosis, balancing robustness, computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

*Xingwei Qu,Shaowen Wang,Zihao Huang,Kai Hua,Fan Yin,Rui-Jie Zhu,Jundong Zhou,Qiyang Min,Zihao Wang,Yizhi Li,Tianyu Zhang,He Xing,Zheng Zhang,Yuxuan Song,Tianyu Zheng,Zhiyuan Zeng,Chenghua Lin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM), a hierarchical language modeling framework that allocates computation more efficiently to semantically important areas through compression and reasoning on concepts rather than uniform token-level processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models waste computational resources by uniformly processing tokens despite the non-uniform information density of language.

Method: The DLCM framework introduces hierarchical compression, concept discovery, and compression-aware scaling laws that allocate compute efficiently across token and concept levels. It uses decoupled µP parametrization for stable hyperparameter transfer across architectures.

Result: DLCM achieves +2.69% average improvement across 12 zero-shot benchmarks by reallocating one-third of inference compute to a semantic reasoning backbone under matched computation constraints.

Conclusion: Hierarchical compression can fundamentally improve language model performance and efficiency through dynamic allocation of computational resources based on semantic density.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

*Zijian Zhao,Yitong Shang,Sen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoFed, a Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) framework aimed at improving traffic prediction by automating hyper-parameter tuning and leveraging a federated representor for effective collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic prediction systems face limitations due to privacy concerns and non-IID data across clients, prompting the need for a privacy-preserving yet collaborative approach that doesn't depend on manual hyper-parameter optimization.

Method: The authors propose AutoFed, a PFL framework that employs a federated representor with client-aligned adapters to distill local data into a shared prompt matrix, enabling personalized predictors for each client.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that AutoFed outperforms existing methods in diverse traffic prediction scenarios, showcasing its efficacy and adaptability.

Conclusion: AutoFed provides a practical, efficient, and privacy-preserving traffic prediction solution, eliminating the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning, and facilitating widespread application in Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

### [282] [A Scalable Framework for logP Prediction: From Terabyte-Scale Data Integration to Interpretable Ensemble Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24643)
*Malikussaid,Septian Caesar Floresko,Ade Romadhony,Isman Kurniawan,Warih Maharani,Hilal Hudan Nuha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study created a large-scale predictive model for logP prediction from a highly curated dataset of 426,850 compounds. It achieved a major computational efficiency improvement, optimized ensemble modeling approaches, and provided strong predictive insights on lipophilicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lipophilicity (logP) is a critical property influencing molecular design, but its accurate prediction remains challenging due to data integration and modeling heteroskedasticity.

Method: The researchers built novel byte-offset indexing for data integration, employed ensemble tree-based methods (e.g., Random Forest and XGBoost), and introduced stratified modeling for drug-like and extreme molecules.

Result: Tree-based models achieved R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units, outperforming linear approaches and achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to graph neural networks.

Conclusion: Descriptor-based ensemble models are effective for logP prediction, providing robust baselines, computational efficiency, and actionable insights for molecular design.

Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.

*Honglin Gao,Lan Zhao,Junhao Ren,Xiang Li,Gaoxi Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a method for targeted backdoor poisoning in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to misclassify nodes while retaining clean accuracy. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of research on backdoor attacks targeting heterogeneous node classification in HGNNs.

Method: HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework, synthesizes trigger features and connection patterns through saliency-based screening and aligns their feature distribution with benign statistics using AdaIN and MMD loss.

Result: Experiments reveal that HeteroHBA outperforms prior techniques in attack success while maintaining minimal impact on clean accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the vulnerability of HGNNs to backdoor attacks and call for the development of improved defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.

*Reza Jahani,Md Farhamdur Reza,Richeng Jin,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how user mobility impacts Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) performance, proposing an induced mobility framework to improve sparse network efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL struggles in connectivity-limited and heterogeneous data environments. Mobility in wireless networks can act as a catalyst for enhancing information flow, yet its potential in DFL is underexplored.

Method: The study demonstrates DFL convergence under user mobility theoretically and introduces a framework leveraging induced mobility patterns to optimize user trajectories based on data distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments validate improved DFL performance, showing superiority over baseline methods and analyzing the roles of network parameters.

Conclusion: User mobility can significantly enhance DFL, with induced mobility patterns optimizing sparse network connectivity and information propagation effectively.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.

*Ali Behrouz,Meisam Razaviyayn,Peilin Zhong,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Nested Learning (NL) paradigm, a coherent model structure with multi-level optimization aimed at improving continual and self-improving learning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are fundamental issues with how language models can effectively self-improve, continually learn, and solve complex problems, necessitating novel learning paradigms.

Method: Nested Learning (NL) is proposed as a model with multi-level optimization processes, expressive optimizers, self-modifying modules, and a general memory system for improved learning capabilities.

Result: The study introduces expressive optimizers, self-modifying sequence models, and a continuum memory system, producing promising results in language modeling, continual learning, and generalization tasks.

Conclusion: The Nested Learning framework offers a structured approach to create expressive and adaptive models, potentially advancing capabilities like higher-order and continuous learning.

Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

*Amir Asiaee,Samhita Pal,James O'quinn,James P. Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DCL-DECOR, a pipeline for causal discovery under mixed latent confounding, effectively isolating pervasive latent effects and achieving better edge recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle mixed latent confounding, where some unobserved factors affect many variables while others influence only a few, leading to misinterpretation of causal structures.

Method: The proposed pipeline decomposes the observed precision matrix into structured and low-rank components to separate pervasive latent effects. It then applies a correlated-noise DAG learner to recover directed edges and reconciles the causal graph for bow-freeness.

Result: Synthetic experiments show that DCL-DECOR consistently improves the recovery of directed edges in the presence of mixed confounding compared to directly applying DAG learning methods on confounded data.

Conclusion: DCL-DECOR modularly addresses mixed latent confounding by reducing the problem into subproblems with guarantees, offering a precision-led approach for improved causal discovery.

Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.

*András Millinghoffer,András Formanek,András Antos,Péter Antal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BandiK, a multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits to address challenges in knowledge transfer and negative task transfer issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of negative transfer and high computational costs in selecting auxiliary task sets for multi-task learning.

Method: BandiK is a three-stage process using multi-bandits: 1) estimating pairwise transfers between tasks, 2) constructing candidate auxiliary task sets, and 3) using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework to optimize selection across tasks.

Result: BandiK reduces computational cost and auxiliary task selection complexity with its novel multi-bandit structure.

Conclusion: BandiK demonstrates an efficient and effective approach to enhancing knowledge transfer in multi-task settings by leveraging a multi-bandit framework.

Abstract: The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.
  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on studying user behavior for autonomous taxis based on operational services, using survey data from Wuhan, China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on actual user behavior with operational autonomous taxi services as opposed to hypothetical scenarios.

Method: The study uses a realistic survey of 336 users in Wuhan, China, with Structural Equation Modeling to analyze latent psychological constructs influencing adoption.

Result: Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are identified as the strongest predictors of autonomous taxi adoption, with other factors playing nuanced roles.

Conclusion: Empirical evidence is provided to guide policies, fare structure, and public outreach for autonomous taxi deployments in urban settings.

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.

*Alan Oursland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives that neural network training objectives inherently perform probabilistic inference, linking optimization and inference processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanations of probabilistic behaviors in neural networks rely on loose analogies, requiring a more direct derivation.

Method: The authors show mathematically that objectives with log-sum-exp structure embed inference within gradient descent, unifying attention, mixture modeling, and classification.

Result: Gradient descent implicitly performs expectation-maximization, eliminating the need for separate inference algorithms.

Conclusion: Optimization and inference in neural networks share the same mechanism due to the inherent structure of certain objectives.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in precise probabilistic DTI predictions and enhance predictive performance using Bayesian inference.

Method: A deep kernel learning-based GP architecture integrates neural embeddings for compounds and proteins with a GP framework, enabling accurate Bayesian predictions and operations.

Result: DTI-GP demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, offering high utility in accuracy-confidence scoring, rejection schemes, and top-ranking predictions.

Conclusion: DTI-GP advances DTI prediction capabilities by integrating Bayesian inference for more reliable and effective decision-making, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.

*Shulun Chen,Runlong Zhou,Zihan Zhang,Maryam Fazel,Simon S. Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for non-transitive preference modeling in aligning large language models (LLMs), showing convergence guarantees for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU), applicable for real-world LLM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference alignment methods for LLMs assume transitive preferences, which fail to capture the complexity of human population preferences. This gap motivates the exploration of non-transitive preference modeling.

Method: The authors propose Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), framing non-transitive preferences as a zero-sum game, and provide convergence guarantees for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$).

Result: The OMWU algorithm achieves linear convergence to Nash equilibrium after a burn-in phase without requiring NE uniqueness, demonstrated theoretically and through experiments on tabular and neural policy classes.

Conclusion: OMWU shows promise for improving preference modeling in LLMs, overcoming limitations of regularization methods while providing efficient alignment and scalability for practical applications.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.

*Raul D. Steleac,Mohan Sridharan,David Abel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study addresses multi-agent coordination challenges by proposing a novel joint-state abstraction and neural graph Laplacian to enhance coordinated behaviours through improved options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinated behaviour among multiple agents is critical due to exponential growth in joint state space, but existing methods sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled behaviors.

Method: Develop a novel joint-state abstraction using state-space compression and employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to discover coordinated options based on state synchronisation patterns.

Result: Evaluates on two domains, demonstrating stronger downstream coordination compared to alternative methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances option discovery for multi-agent coordination by leveraging synchronisation patterns and state-space abstraction.

Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scarcity of complete training data and the lack of uncertainty quantification in current AOD reconstruction models.

Method: AODDiff framework uses a corruption-aware training strategy to learn from incomplete data and a decoupled annealing posterior sampling method to integrate heterogeneous observations.

Result: AODDiff demonstrated high performance in downscaling and inpainting tasks, maintaining spatial spectral fidelity and enabling uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling.

Conclusion: AODDiff is a versatile and robust approach for AOD field reconstruction, with added benefits of uncertainty quantification, adaptable to various tasks without retraining.

Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.

*András Millinghoffer,Bence Bolgár,Péter Antal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper hypothesizes that transfer effects are better captured by adjusting data samples rather than model updates, using multi-task learning curves with a focus on drug-target interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more fundamental and complementary way of characterizing transfer effects during training and inductive inference.

Method: Proposing multi-task learning curves modeling transfer effects by monitoring performance over varying data sizes; efficiently approximated using a method similar to Task Affinity Grouping.

Result: Demonstrated that learning curves efficiently capture multi-task transfer effects, with evaluations showcasing pairwise/contextual transfer in foundation models using a benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning curves provide a more effective approach to delineate transfer effects compared to traditional methods, despite statistical versus computational tradeoffs.

Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

*Zihao Chen,Alexandre Andre,Wenrui Ma,Ian Knight,Sergey Shuvaev,Eva Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PRISM method for time series forecasting, which leverages hierarchical tree-based partitioning to address challenges in real-world signal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of real-world time series, comprising global trends, local structures, and multi-scale features, poses challenges for accurate forecasting.

Method: PRISM utilizes a learnable tree-based partitioning approach, dividing signals into hierarchical levels with time-frequency-based projections to capture scale-specific features for forecasting.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods on various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a flexible and efficient solution for multivariate time series forecasting, effectively modeling global and local dynamics.

Abstract: Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the decoding of brain states from neuroimaging data by integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, addressing limitations of conventional methods.

Method: The method utilizes a SpectralBrainGNN model based on graph Fourier transforms of functional MRI connectomes, employing normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition for capturing brain connectivity patterns.

Conclusion: The SpectralBrainGNN model successfully advances brain state decoding by leveraging GNNs for understanding functional connectivity, and its public implementation supports reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%.

*Xinyang Chen,Amaël Broustet,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF) for better persistent homology features and uses it to improve graph classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current graph filtration methods in persistent homology, which often miss recurring information and more expressive features.

Method: The authors propose FSF, a graph filtration derived from frequent subgraphs, and introduce two graph classification frameworks: FPH-ML and FPH-GNNs.

Result: FPH-ML outperforms kernel-based and degree-based methods in classification accuracy, and FPH improves graph neural network performance by 0.4–21% across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The integration of FSF in persistent homology contributes to more informative topology-aware features and enhances the performance of graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.

*András Antos,András Millinghoffer,Péter Antal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL) to tackle modern AI/ML problems involving partner evaluation and selection. It uses the developed GapE algorithm and SOMMAB model to improve error bounds and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in evaluating contributions and selecting the most beneficial candidates in shared, asymmetric, and computationally intensive processes common in AI and ML systems.

Method: The proposed method involves using the Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL) framework, which employs a pure-exploration model termed SOMMAB. A specialized GapE algorithm is developed to learn a directed graph of optimal contributions via overlapping candidate evaluations.

Result: The research derives improved exponential error bounds and demonstrates that the bounds scale linearly with overlap degree. This leads to significant reductions in sample complexity and improved solution efficiency.

Conclusion: This study provides theoretical advancements and performance guarantees for applying the SSNL framework in various sequential learning contexts, such as multi-task learning, auxiliary task learning, federated learning, and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.
  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.
  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).

*Cristina P. Martin-Linares,Jonathan P. Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline to create and transfer consistent, interpretable features across sparse autoencoders, improving their reliability and reusability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address redundancy and inconsistencies in sparse autoencoder features, which hinders interpretation, transfer, and reuse.

Method: The authors propose a new iterative pipeline, DMSAEs. It distills a consistent core of features by training Matryoshka SAEs, measuring features' importance using gradient X activation, and retaining only the most significant ones. The distilled core encoder weights are reused across training cycles.

Result: On benchmark activations, DMSAEs distilled 197 consistent features after seven iterative cycles. Using the distilled core, the new models improved performance on multiple metrics, showing better feature consistency and transferability.

Conclusion: DMSAEs provide a systematic way to distill and transfer useful, interpretable latent features, offering enhanced performance and cross-sparsity consistency for sparse autoencoders.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels

*Gyung Hyun Je,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores predicting the data efficiency of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) across specialized tasks without incremental annotation cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned LLMs outperform zero-shot models on certain tasks; however, determining the number of fine-tuning samples required for the desired performance level is often costly and inefficient.

Method: A novel metric quantifies data efficiency, and gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples predicts data efficiency using minimal labeled samples.

Result: On diverse tasks, the model achieves 8.6% error in data efficiency prediction, reducing the need for hundreds of additional annotations per task.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively predicts data efficiency, improving task fine-tuning efficiency and reducing annotation costs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.

### [301] [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063)
*Diji Yang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans) to enable sampling diverse models from a single set of pre-trained weights, enhancing task performance and semantic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of deterministic single-hypothesis approaches in modern transformers by creating a model that allows for diverse functional behaviors in alignment with the idea that intelligence emerges from multiplicity.

Method: They treat normalization layer offsets as stochastic variables using Gaussian variational approximations, creating a posterior proxy to generate diverse model instances from pre-trained weights. Noise is frozen at the sequence level for coherence.

Result: B-Trans demonstrates improved exploration, task performance, and semantic diversity in experiments on zero-shot generation, RL with Verifiable Rewards, and RL without explicit labels.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Bayesian Transformers enable models to leverage the wisdom of crowds for more effective and diverse decision-making, outperforming traditional deterministic baselines.

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

*Haozhe Jiang,Nika Haghtalab,Lijie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are shown to be efficient parallel samplers, enhanced by chain-of-thought (CoT) and techniques like remasking or revision for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to formalize the advantage of DLMs over autoregressive models for parallel token generation with faster inference.

Method: The authors analyze the performance of DLMs augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) and examine their expressivity and efficiency in simulating parallel sampling algorithms, with theoretical proofs demonstrating their space complexity when remasking or revision is enabled.

Result: DLMs with CoT can simulate parallel sampling with minimal sequential steps. The introduction of remasking or revision enhances their expressivity and optimizes space complexity.

Conclusion: DLMs are theoretically positioned as the most efficient parallel samplers when equipped with CoT and revision, making them superior for parallel generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop language models capable of making accurate predictions for high-stakes decisions, addressing the limitations of current forecasting techniques.

Method: They create a dataset from synthesized forecasting questions derived from global news events and train models using reinforcement learning and retrieval-based methods.

Result: Their OpenForecaster model achieves competitive performance with significantly larger proprietary models and demonstrates improvements in prediction accuracy, calibration, and consistency.

Conclusion: OpenForecaster advances forecasting accuracy and generalization, sharing its tools with the community to foster further research in language model-driven forecasting.

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

*Timo Kaufmann,Yannick Metz,Daniel Keim,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResponseRank, a method for robustly learning preference strength from noisy proxy signals by focusing on local comparisons and introduces a new metric, PDC, for utility learning analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the challenges in determining the strength of preferences and handling noisy metadata, the study aims to improve the reliability of decision-making models under uncertainty.

Method: ResponseRank ranks responses to pairwise comparisons based on inferred preference strength using relative proxy signal differences. It controls systemic variations by comparing signals locally in carefully constructed strata.

Result: The method demonstrates improved sample efficiency and robustness through experiments on synthetic preference learning, language modeling, and RL control tasks.

Conclusion: ResponseRank effectively learns preference strengths robustly with minimal assumptions, showcasing strong performance across various settings, while the PDC metric aids in evaluating ordinal and cardinal utility.

Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors show that both uniform and learnable attention architectures use the same underlying algorithm for modular addition, utilizing topologically and geometrically equivalent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether differing attention mechanisms create distinct algorithms or circuits for modular addition in neural network architectures.

Method: The study utilizes a methodology that identifies and analyzes groups of learned neurons as manifolds using tools from topology. It compares these representations across hundreds of circuits.

Result: The study finds that regardless of attention type, modular addition circuits learned by neural networks are statistically and geometrically identical.

Conclusion: Uniform and learnable attention architectures do not inherently differ in their learned modular addition circuits, and these can be universally understood through topology and geometry.

Abstract: The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.

*Charles Oriioma,Josef Krivan,Rujeena Mathema,Pedro G. Lind,Alexander Szorkovszky,Shailendra Bhandari*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes and evaluates an adaptive method for distinguishing ocular fixations and saccades by minimizing state transitions using a Markovian model, offering improved accuracy and noise robustness in eye-gaze classification algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately classifying fixations and saccades is essential for cognitive research, but current methods rely on static thresholds that may introduce bias and fail under variable conditions.

Method: The authors use a Markovian approximation to create adaptive thresholds for saccades and fixations. They test three algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, dispersion) across tasks and noise levels, optimizing for thresholds using K-ratio minimization.

Result: Velocity thresholds have the highest baseline accuracy (90-93%), but degrade under noise. Adaptive algorithms, especially dispersion-based thresholds, achieve over 81% accuracy under high noise conditions but sacrifice saccade accuracy for fixation precision.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding methods, particularly dispersion-based thresholds, enhance the robustness and precision of eye-gaze dynamics classifications, providing valuable techniques for experimentalists working with noisy data.

Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels (σ = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study addresses the limitation of existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) by proposing a new method, DCF2D, to intelligently handle constraint coupling in CMOPs, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMOEAs often aggregate and simplify constraints without understanding their geometric interactions, which diminishes their interpretability and effectiveness.

Method: The proposed method (DCF2D) detects constraint couplings and directs the search more effectively by creating auxiliary populations that correspond to each constraint and using tailored search directions.

Result: DCF2D showed better performance than five state-of-the-art CMOEAs across seven benchmarks and real-world CMOPs.

Conclusion: Decoupling constraints in CMOPs and utilizing informed search directions improves optimization performance, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Real-world Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) often contain multiple constraints, and understanding and utilizing the coupling between these constraints is crucial for solving CMOPs. However, existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) typically ignore these couplings and treat all constraints as a single aggregate, which lacks interpretability regarding the specific geometric roles of constraints. To address this limitation, we first analyze how different constraints interact and show that the final Constrained Pareto Front (CPF) depends not only on the Pareto fronts of individual constraints but also on the boundaries of infeasible regions. This insight implies that CMOPs with different coupling types must be solved from different search directions. Accordingly, we propose a novel algorithm named Decoupling Constraint from Two Directions (DCF2D). This method periodically detects constraint couplings and spawns an auxiliary population for each relevant constraint with an appropriate search direction. Extensive experiments on seven challenging CMOP benchmark suites and on a collection of real-world CMOPs demonstrate that DCF2D outperforms five state-of-the-art CMOEAs, including existing decoupling-based methods.

Result: TESO outperforms benchmarks in a queue optimization problem, validating its memory-based strategies for exploration and exploitation.

Conclusion: TESO is effective for simulation optimization, providing a reliable balance between exploration and exploitation, with publicly available code for replicability.

Abstract: Simulation optimization (SO) is frequently challenged by noisy evaluations, high computational costs, and complex, multimodal search landscapes. This paper introduces Tabu-Enhanced Simulation Optimization (TESO), a novel metaheuristic framework integrating adaptive search with memory-based strategies. TESO leverages a short-term Tabu List to prevent cycling and encourage diversification, and a long-term Elite Memory to guide intensification by perturbing high-performing solutions. An aspiration criterion allows overriding tabu restrictions for exceptional candidates. This combination facilitates a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation in stochastic environments. We demonstrate TESO's effectiveness and reliability using an queue optimization problem, showing improved performance compared to benchmarks and validating the contribution of its memory components.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper develops a genetic programming method to create better convergence acceleration methods for neutron transport problems compared to classical techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical acceleration methods like Aitken's delta-squared and Wynn epsilon often fail to generalize across diverse neutron transport problems, motivating the need for new approaches tailored to specific convergence characteristics.

Method: The authors used genetic programming to evolve mathematical formulas optimized for SN convergence characteristics in neutron transport problems.

Result: The discovered formulas improved convergence in over 75% of cases, nearly doubling the success rate of classical methods for the given problem set.

Conclusion: The study highlights genetic programming's potential to develop innovative numerical methods for complex computational physics problems, honoring the legacy of advancements in experimental mathematics applied to neutron transport.

Abstract: We present a genetic programming approach to automatically discover convergence acceleration methods for discrete ordinates solutions of neutron transport problems in slab geometry. Classical acceleration methods such as Aitken's delta-squared and Wynn epsilon assume specific convergence patterns and do not generalize well to the broad set of transport problems encountered in practice. We evolved mathematical formulas specifically tailored to SN convergence characteristics in this work. The discovered accelerator, featuring second differences and cross-product terms, achieved over 75 percent success rate in improving convergence compared to raw sequences - almost double that observed for classical techniques for the problem set considered. This work demonstrates the potential for discovering novel numerical methods in computational physics via genetic programming and attempts to honor Prof. Ganapol's legacy of advancing experimental mathematics applied to neutron transport.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The hippocampus might utilize a single core algorithm based on the stationary distribution of a random walk to perform both memory retrieval and spatial navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the seemingly distinct functions of the hippocampus (memory retrieval and spatial navigation) share a common algorithmic foundation.

Method: The study compares two algorithms – personalized page-rank for memory retrieval and successor representations for planning/navigation – and analyzes their isomorphism through the stationary distribution of a graph-based random walk.

Result: The authors demonstrate that these two algorithms are isomorphic and rely on the same computational foundation: the stationary distribution of a random walk.

Conclusion: The hippocampus likely implements a unified computational function that computes the stationary distribution of a random walk on input graphs, supporting both memory retrieval and spatial navigation.

Abstract: The hippocampus appears to implement two core but highly distinct functions in the brain: long term memory retrieval and planning and spatial navigation. Naively, these functions appear very different algorithmically. In this short note, we demonstrate that two powerful algorithms that have each independently been proposed to underlie the hippocampal operation for each function -- personalized page-rank for memory retrieval, and successor representations for planning and navigation, are in fact isomorphic and utilize the same underlying representation -- the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph. We hypothesize that the core computational function of the hippocampus is to compute this representation on arbitrary input graphs.

### [311] [Enforcing Temporal Constraints for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23738)
*Adharsh Kamath,Sishen Zhang,Calvin Xu,Shubham Ugare,Gagandeep Singh,Sasa Misailovic*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Agent-C is a framework ensuring LLM agents adhere to temporal safety policies by providing runtime guarantees, improving both safety and utility in critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current guardrail systems, which fail to prevent violations of temporal safety policies governing agent action sequences, especially in safety-critical applications.

Method: Agent-C employs a domain-specific language for expressing temporal constraints, translates them to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving for action verification and constrained generation of compliant actions.

Result: Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance) and improves utility in real-world applications and across multiple language models when compared to state-of-the-art guardrails.

Conclusion: Agent-C sets a new state-of-the-art standard in reliable agent reasoning by ensuring both temporal safety compliance and improved task performance.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are deployed in safety-critical applications, yet current guardrail systems fail to prevent violations of temporal safety policies, requirements that govern the ordering and sequencing of agent actions. For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action. We evaluate Agent-C across two real-world applications: retail customer service and airline ticket reservation system, and multiple language models (open and closed-source). Our results demonstrate that Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance, 0% harm), while improving task utility compared to state-of-the-art guardrails and unrestricted agents. On SoTA closed-source models, Agent-C improves conformance (77.4% to 100% for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 83.7% to 100% for GPT-5), while simultaneously increasing utility (71.8% to 75.2% and 66.1% to 70.6%, respectively), representing a new SoTA frontier for reliable agentic reasoning.

TL;DR: The authors propose a universal factor abstraction interface for probabilistic programming to enable flexible model representations and inference in mixed discrete-continuous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic programming languages limit experimentation by tying models to specific inference algorithms, making flexible representation and complex hybrid model inference difficult.

Method: They developed a factor abstraction framework with five fundamental operations that allow manipulation across varying factor representations.

Result: This abstraction framework supports representation-agnostic probabilistic programming, enabling unified models with diverse factor representations.

Conclusion: The method overcomes limitations of current tools, allowing practical inference in complex hybrid models and facilitating advanced probabilistic programming experimentation.

Abstract: Current probabilistic programming languages and tools tightly couple model representations with specific inference algorithms, preventing experimentation with novel representations or mixed discrete-continuous models. We introduce a factor abstraction with five fundamental operations that serve as a universal interface for manipulating factors regardless of their underlying representation. This enables representation-agnostic probabilistic programming where users can freely mix different representations (e.g. discrete tables, Gaussians distributions, sample-based approaches) within a single unified framework, allowing practical inference in complex hybrid models that current toolkits cannot adequately express.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in memory management across diverse hardware platforms, from constrained embedded devices to high-performance parallel systems.

Method: VGC integrates a dual-layer architecture comprising Active VGC (runtime, concurrent mark-and-sweep for parallel workloads) and Passive VGC (compile-time static memory mapping).

Result: Reduces pause times by up to 30% in multithreaded benchmarks and decreases total memory usage by up to 25%, improving scalability and predictability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances memory management efficiency through its adaptable dual-layer design, benefiting applications in both low level and high level programming settings.

Abstract: The Virtual Garbage Collector (VGC) introduces a novel memory management framework designed to optimize performance across diverse systems, ranging from resource constrained embedded devices to high performance parallel architectures. Unlike conventional garbage collectors, VGC employs a dual layer architecture consisting of Active VGC and Passive VGC to enable efficient, low overhead memory management. Active VGC dynamically manages runtime objects using a concurrent mark and sweep strategy tailored for parallel workloads, reducing pause times by up to 30 percent compared to generational collectors in multithreaded benchmarks. Passive VGC operates at compile time and optimizes static object allocation through predictive memory mapping, minimizing fragmentation by aligning objects to cache boundaries. This separation of responsibilities ensures predictable memory access patterns, reduces total memory usage by up to 25 percent, and improves scalability for modern parallel applications. By integrating compile time and runtime optimizations, VGC provides a robust and adaptable solution for memory intensive systems across both low level and high level programming environments.

*A. R. Balasubramanian,Mohammad Hossein Khoshechin Jorshari,Rupak Majumdar,Umang Mathur,Minjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a poly-time Monte Carlo estimator to count Mazurkiewicz trace-equivalent classes in concurrent programs, an inapproximable #P-hard problem. Their method shows stable estimates with practical applications in model checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better predict model checking duration and explore coverage in concurrent program interleavings, solving a challenging trace-equivalence estimation problem posed as #P-hard.

Method: Develop a Monte Carlo method using a stateless optimal DPOR algorithm, transforming it into a bounded exploration tree and applying Knuth's estimator. Stochastic enumeration controls variance and improves performance.

Result: The proposed estimator, implemented in JMC, achieves stable estimates within 20% error bounds after a few hundred trials, even on benchmarks with large state spaces.

Conclusion: This is the first algorithm offering provable poly-time unbiased estimators for counting traces, aiding effective resource allocation in model checking.

Abstract: We study the estimation problem for concurrent programs: given a bounded program $P$, estimate the number of Mazurkiewicz trace-equivalence classes induced by its interleavings. This quantity informs two practical questions for enumeration-based model checking: how long a model checking run is likely to take, and what fraction of the search space has been covered so far. We first show the counting problem is #P-hard even for restricted programs and, unless $P=NP$, inapproximable within any subexponential factor, ruling out efficient exact or randomized approximation algorithms. We give a Monte Carlo approach to obtain a poly-time unbiased estimator: we convert a stateless optimal DPOR algorithm into an unbiased estimator by viewing its exploration as a bounded-depth, bounded-width tree whose leaves are the maximal Mazurkiewicz traces. A classical estimator by Knuth, when run on this tree, yields an unbiased estimate. To control the variance, we apply stochastic enumeration by maintaining a small population of partial paths per depth whose evolution is coupled. We have implemented our estimator in the JMC model checker and evaluated it on shared-memory benchmarks. With modest budgets, our estimator yields stable estimates, typically within a 20% band, within a few hundred trials, even when the state space has $10^5$--$10^6$ classes. We also show how the same machinery estimates model-checking cost by weighting all explored graphs, not only complete traces. Our algorithms provide the first provable poly-time unbiased estimators for counting traces, a problem of considerable importance when allocating model checking resources.

### [315] [Simultaneous Extrinsic Contact and In-Hand Pose Estimation via Distributed Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23856)
*Mark Van der Merwe,Kei Ota,Dmitry Berenson,Nima Fazeli,Devesh K. Jha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining tactile sensing and physical contact constraints in a factor graph to enhance object pose and contact estimation for tasks requiring prehensile manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate object pose and contact estimation in prehensile manipulation tasks is critical for applications like assembly or tool use. Challenges arise due to the locality of tactile sensing and noise or occlusion in visual feedback.

Method: The authors propose a method leveraging tactile observations and enforcing physical constraints using a factor graph framework. This ensures consistency with tactile data while respecting kinematic and force constraints of rigid body interactions.

Result: The proposed method showed superior performance compared to existing solutions, particularly in scenarios relying solely on tactile information.

Conclusion: Combining tactile sensing with physical constraints in a factor graph improves estimation accuracy in prehensile manipulation tasks. The method mitigates ambiguities and overcomes tactile sensing limitations.

Abstract: Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

### [316] [Learning to Feel the Future: DreamTacVLA for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23864)
*Guo Ye,Zexi Zhang,Xu Zhao,Shang Wu,Haoran Lu,Shihan Lu,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DreamTacVLA, a model for enhancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robots with tactile perception, allowing better performance in contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in generalizing control tasks but are blind to physical contact, making them ineffective for tasks requiring force, texture, and slip reasoning.

Method: DreamTacVLA uses high-resolution tactile images combined with wrist-camera and third-person views to create multi-scale sensory understanding. It incorporates a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment loss for aligning sensory inputs and employs a tactile world model to predict future tactile signals.

Result: DreamTacVLA achieved up to 95% success in contact-rich manipulation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art VLA baselines.

Conclusion: Grounding VLA models in tactile dynamics significantly enhances their capabilities for touch-aware robotics, making them more robust in real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

*Liangtao Feng,Zhenchang Liu,Feng Zhang,Xuefeng Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHIELD, a novel method leveraging LiDAR for efficient drone exploration, addressing computational, point-cloud quality, and classification challenges in UAV exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in LiDAR-based UAV exploration, such as poor point-cloud quality, high computational overhead, and difficulties in classifying free space.

Method: SHIELD employs an observation-quality occupancy map, a hybrid frontier approach, and a spherical-projection ray-casting strategy to improve efficiency and safety in LiDAR-based drone exploration.

Result: Simulations and flight experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SHIELD in improving exploration efficiency and flight safety.

Conclusion: SHIELD enhances LiDAR-based drone exploration by addressing major challenges, validated by successful experiments, and will be open-sourced for further community contributions.

Abstract: This paper introduces SHIELD, a Spherical-Projection Hybrid-Frontier Integration for Efficient LiDAR-based Drone exploration method. Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.

*Takashi Yamamoto,Hiroaki Yaguchi,Shohei Kato,Hiroyuki Okada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of dual-agency structure in service robots, focusing on user perceptions of switching between autonomous and operator-mediated modes during domestic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how users perceive and interact with service robots that combine autonomous and operator-mediated control, especially as this dual-agency structure may affect task performance and human impressions.

Method: The researchers used an early-stage prototype (2020) integrating natural-language chat and sketch annotations over the robot’s live camera. They evaluated three modes – autonomous, remote, and hybrid – in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator, leveraging a World Robot Summit rule-compliant test field.

Result: Findings showed mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and notable insights on perceived security. Multiple agencies within one robot influenced user impressions, particularly during transitions or blending of control.

Conclusion: The study provides guidelines for designing user-friendly human-in-the-loop control frameworks in domestic service robots and highlights the importance of managing user perceptions in dual-agency robotic systems.

Abstract: A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions. These findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks.

Result: The platform provides customizable modules, rich traffic scenarios, and open-source resources for UAV low-altitude traffic research.

Conclusion: This integrated platform advances UAV traffic research by offering a flexible, high-precision, and open-source solution to simulate UAV traffic networks effectively.

Abstract: Significant challenges are posed by simulation and testing in the field of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic due to the high costs associated with large-scale UAV testing and the complexity of establishing low-altitude traffic test scenarios. Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated high-fidelity simulation platform for low-altitude UAV traffic. This platform simulates all components of the UAV traffic network, including the control system, the traffic management system, the UAV system, the communication network , the anomaly and fault modules, etc. Furthermore, it integrates RflySim/AirSim and Unreal Engine 5 to develop full-state models of UAVs and 3D maps that model the real world using the oblique photogrammetry technique. Additionally, the platform offers a wide range of interfaces, and all models and scenarios can be customized with a high degree of flexibility. The platform's source code has been released, making it easier to conduct research related to low-altitude traffic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to address reasoning and precision challenges in general-purpose robotics through a new benchmark (ERIQ) and a novel action tokenizer (FACT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models struggle with combining broad generalization and precise action execution in open-world robotics.

Method: The authors propose ERIQ, a benchmark for embodied reasoning, and FACT, an action tokenizer for converting continuous control into discrete sequences for precise robotic manipulation.

Result: ERIQ demonstrates a correlation between reasoning and generalization, while GenieReasoner, using FACT, outperforms prior baselines in reasoning and action precision.

Conclusion: ERIQ and FACT collectively advance the ability to diagnose reasoning-precision challenges and improve robotic manipulation in open-world contexts.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Motivation: To address challenges in mixed traffic involving automated vehicles and humans, and ensure safe interactions with vulnerable road users like pedestrians.

Method: The authors identify and integrate four key enablers: advanced perception, vehicular communication, social human-robot interaction, and formal specification. They demonstrate a proof-of-concept combining the first three enablers.

Result: The proof-of-concept showcases a social robot that guides pedestrians in mixed traffic scenarios, specifically with a cooperative automated e-bike.

Conclusion: Social robots can serve as effective moderators in traffic systems, promoting safer interactions between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users. Further research and integration are needed.

Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.

Motivation: Scaling vision-language-action (VLA) policies to bimanual robots with dexterous hands is challenging due to complex action spaces, occlusions, and data collection costs.

Method: The authors propose GR-Dexter, involving a 21-degree-of-freedom robotic hand, a teleoperation system for data collection, and training with diverse datasets, including teleoperation trajectories and vision-language data.

Result: GR-Dexter demonstrates robust performance in long-horizon manipulations and better generalization to unseen objects and instructions, emphasizing its effectiveness in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: GR-Dexter represents a significant step forward in generalist robotic manipulation, offering improved robustness and practical use for complex bimanual tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation.

*Ming-Ming Yu,Yi Chen,Börje F. Karlsson,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RANGER, a framework for zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation using a monocular camera, eliminating dependence on depth/pose data. It improves task efficiency via in-context learning (ICL) and works well in new environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object goal navigation methods rely heavily on simulators providing precise data (depth/pose) and lack ICL capability, limiting adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Method: RANGER integrates features like keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model exploration estimation, adaptive waypoint selection, and action execution, enabling zero-shot navigation using a monocular camera.

Result: RANGER achieves competitive navigation success and exploration efficiency on the HM3D benchmark and real-world settings, while showing superior adaptability without requiring pre-mapped 3D environments.

Conclusion: RANGER overcomes limitations of existing methods by eliminating reliance on precise depth/pose data and enabling ICL adaptability, making it highly efficient and suitable for real-world navigation tasks.

Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.

*Fuqiang Gu,Jiangshan Ai,Xu Lu,Xianlei Long,Yan Li,Tao Jiang,Chao Chen,Huidong Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The underactuated, nonlinear, and tightly coupled dynamics of quadrotor UAVs make trajectory tracking challenging, and traditional approaches often fail to deliver satisfactory performance.

Method: The proposed HBO-PID algorithm incorporates Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization to model input-dependent noise variance, enhancing the adaptability to dynamic environments. A two-stage optimization process is utilized for better convergence in optimizing controller parameters.

Result: In both simulations and real-world testing, HBO-PID outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 24.7% to 42.9% improvement in position accuracy and 40.9% to 78.4% improvement in angular accuracy.

Conclusion: HBO-PID offers a significant advancement in robust and precise trajectory tracking for UAVs, outperforming existing methods and better adapting to complex dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.

TL;DR: This paper addresses constrained motion planning in robotics using a data-driven approach. It introduces a neural network to predict robot-obstacle distances for optimizing paths in latent space, improving speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained motion planning is often slow and requires repetitive validity checks and replanning due to errors in current latent manifold approximation techniques and detecting collisions in latent space.

Method: The paper trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles based on latent vectors. This distance gradient directs movement in latent space to avoid obstacles, coupled with a local path optimization algorithm.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in planning speed across various scenarios while maintaining effective obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Incorporating distance gradient predictions in latent space reduces the need for frequent replanning and improves the efficiency of motion planning.

Abstract: Constrained motion planning is a common but challenging problem in robotic manipulation. In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios, demonstrating the fastest planning speed

*Ruitong Li,Lin Zhang,Yuenan Zhao,Chengxin Liu,Ran Song,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes DRL-TH, a DRL-based navigation framework using temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to improve autonomous navigation of UGVs in crowded environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL approaches for UGV navigation often fail to capture temporal context and struggle with dynamic fusion of multi-modal data, limiting their adaptability and performance.

Method: The method involves the Temporal-guided Graph Attention Network (TG-GAT) for capturing temporal correlations and the Graph Hierarchical Abstraction Module (GHAM) for adaptive multi-modal data fusion using hierarchical pooling and weighted integration.

Result: DRL-TH outperformed existing methods in navigation tasks across crowded environments, demonstrating robust performance both in simulations and real-world UGV implementations.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-TH framework effectively addresses limitations in temporal context awareness and adaptive multi-modal fusion, enhancing UGV navigation in complex and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have demonstrated potential for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in crowded environments. Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.

*Yinuo Zhao,Huiqian Jin,Lechun Jiang,Xinyi Zhang,Kun Wu,Pei Ren,Zhiyuan Xu,Zhengping Che,Lei Sun,Dapeng Wu,Chi Harold Liu,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SiLRI is a novel state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning approach for real-world robot manipulation that uses uncertain human interventions, outperforming prior methods in efficiency and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of utilizing potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to train robots effectively, reducing reliance on human effort without hindering learning progress.

Method: SiLRI formulates the problem as constrained RL optimization, incorporating state-specific uncertainty about human interventions via state-wise Lagrange multipliers and solving it with min-max optimization.

Result: SiLRI reduces the time to achieve a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared to HIL-SERL and achieves 100% success in complex manipulation tasks where other RL methods fail.

Conclusion: Using human interventions as guidance rather than direct imitation maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of real-world RL while overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to training precise and dexterous robotic manipulation policies in an online manner, enabling robots to learn from their own experience while gradually reducing human labor. However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome constrained data availability and diversity in human manipulation tasks, which restricts policy generalization and benchmarking.

Method: To achieve this, the authors developed WiYH, comprising a wearable data collection kit with automatic labeling, a large dataset with 1,000 hours of multi-modal data, and benchmarks enabling comprehensive manipulation learning.

Conclusion: WiYH offers the community a robust system for advancing human-centric data collection and manipulation learning, aiming to enhance policy design and generalization.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training is fundamental for generalization in language and vision models, but data for dexterous hand manipulation remains limited in scale and diversity, hindering policy generalization. Limited scenario diversity, misaligned modalities, and insufficient benchmarking constrain current human manipulation datasets. To address these gaps, we introduce World In Your Hands (WiYH), a large-scale open-source ecosystem for human-centric manipulation learning. WiYH includes (1) the Oracle Suite, a wearable data collection kit with an auto-labeling pipeline for accurate motion capture; (2) the WiYH Dataset, featuring over 1,000 hours of multi-modal manipulation data across hundreds of skills in diverse real-world scenarios; and (3) extensive annotations and benchmarks supporting tasks from perception to action. Furthermore, experiments based on the WiYH ecosystem show that integrating WiYH's human-centric data significantly enhances the generalization and robustness of dexterous hand policies in tabletop manipulation tasks. We believe that World In Your Hands will bring new insights into human-centric data collection and policy learning to the community.

*Camron Alexander Hirst,Chris Reale,Eric Frew*

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel 3D path-following guidance algorithms using nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) for fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems and tests their real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and adaptability of 3D path-following guidance for fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems, especially in high-curvature paths and at high speeds.

Method: Two different MPC formulations were designed and implemented. The first uses a static reference path rate to encourage constant inertial speed; the second dynamically optimizes the reference path rate considering a tradeoff between path progression and path deviation. Both approaches rely on system modeling of the RAAVEN aircraft and are tested on 3D arc-length parameterized curves.

Result: The MPC guidance algorithms achieved superior performance compared to a baseline lookahead guidance method, demonstrating high feasibility and precision in following high-curvature 3D test paths at speeds up to 36 m/s.

Conclusion: The findings validate the effectiveness of nonlinear MPC in controlling small uncrewed aircraft for complex 3D paths, offering a promising advancement for path-following guidance in this domain.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and flight test results of two novel 3D path-following guidance algorithms based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), with specific application to fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems. To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.

The proposed framework employs a keypoint-aware encoder and a plane-based geometric transformer to extract discriminative features for loop closure detection and relative pose estimation. To further improve global consistency, we include inter-session scan matching cost factors in the factor-graph optimization stage. We evaluate our framework on the public datasets, as well as self-collected data from diverse environments. The results show accurate and robust map merging with low error, and the learned features deliver strong performance in both loop closure detection and relative pose estimation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently validate critical and challenging aspects of autonomous racing systems, such as high-speed maneuvers and localization, using an automated simulation pipeline.

Method: The method involves using a high-fidelity vehicle model as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU), a pipeline capable of running three times faster than real-time, and simulation with scenario initialization and fault injection modules.

Result: The pipeline validates key modules under varying conditions and simulates scenarios efficiently by introducing faults like sensor delays and perturbations. It also includes automated reporting for effective analysis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed automated pipeline successfully enables efficient testing and validation of critical components in autonomous racing systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

TL;DR: This work proposes CF-VLA, a self-reflective Vision-Language-Action model for autonomous driving that uses counterfactual reasoning to ensure safe and appropriate actions and demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving can interpret their reasoning and planned actions but lack the capability to evaluate whether those actions are safe or appropriate.

Method: CF-VLA introduces a system with meta-action generation, counterfactual reasoning based on visual context, and corrected meta-actions for safer trajectory outputs. It employs a rollout-filter-label pipeline to enhance training using high-value scenes and labeled reasoning traces.

Result: CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, safety by 20.5%, and only applies counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios, showing adaptive capabilities.

Conclusion: CF-VLA provides a step towards autonomous driving models that can reason about the consequences of their actions and self-correct, thus achieving safer and smarter systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fast and integrated system for generating high-quality 3D meshes from a single RGB-D image, aimed at advancing real-time robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics requires high-fidelity 3D meshes to predict grasps, detect collisions, and simulate dynamics effectively. Current methods are slow and lack contextual grounding, hindering real-time applications.

Method: The authors developed an end-to-end pipeline combining open-vocabulary segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, optimized for speed and accuracy.

Result: The system generates contextually grounded 3D meshes in under one second, demonstrating practical utility in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system significantly enhances robotic perception by enabling fast and contextual 3D mesh generation, paving the way for practical on-demand mesh applications.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a fundamental representation widely used in computer science and engineering. In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Semantic Lookout, a vision-language model (VLM) system that provides fallback maneuvers for autonomous maritime vessels in compliance with the draft IMO MASS Code, focusing on practical and human-overridable short-term actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by challenges in meeting the operational requirements of autonomous and remotely supervised vessels under the draft IMO MASS Code, especially for managing out-of-distribution events that require semantic understanding.

Method: The authors created a camera-only fallback maneuver system called Semantic Lookout based on vision-language models (VLMs). It uses semantic awareness and a fast-slow anomaly pipeline to select cautious, human-overridable fallback maneuvers for vessels.

Result: Tests on harbor scenes showed that the fallback system achieves high semantic awareness with minimal latency, outperforms baseline geometry-only models in safety (e.g., fire hazards), and is validated through field testing.

Conclusion: VLM-based systems can serve as effective fallback maneuver selectors compatible with IMO MASS Code, enabling safer short-horizon decisions and motivating hybrid approaches that pair semantics with sensory perception.

Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a grasp planning algorithm incorporating contact stability alongside geometric compatibility to improve grasp success across simulation and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability of surface fitting-based grasping algorithms, which often neglect the stability of contact point distribution and result in unstable grasps.

Method: This method introduces a three-step approach inspired by human grasping: rotation optimization, translation refinement, and gripper aperture adjustment.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated reduced Center of Mass (CoM) misalignment and improved grasp success rates in simulations (15 objects, CAD and YCB datasets) and real-world tests using a UR3e robot.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully integrates contact stability and geometric compatibility, outperforming existing baselines in both simulations and real-world execution, improving grasp reliability.

Abstract: In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAM, a visuomotor policy that addresses state ambiguity by using adaptive working memory to support a long history window (300-frames) while maintaining high speed and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address state ambiguity in robotic manipulation, where identical observations may belong to different valid behavior trajectories, requiring a computationally efficient way of utilizing historical context.

Method: PAM employs a hierarchical frame feature extractor for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation, a context router for compact feature representation across multiple history lengths, and an auxiliary objective for reconstructing historical information to ensure bottleneck effectiveness.

Result: PAM effectively handles complex state ambiguity scenarios across 7 designed tasks and maintains stable training, a long history window (~10 seconds), and inference speeds above 20Hz.

Conclusion: PAM provides a robust solution for state ambiguity in robotic manipulation by leveraging adaptive working memory, balancing accuracy, speed, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation. Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework combining graph-based planning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve autonomous robot navigation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots must balance long-range navigation and reactive collision avoidance in dynamic, complex settings, but existing methods excel at one aspect while falling short on the other.

Method: The authors introduce HMP-DRL, a framework that integrates a graph-based global planner with a DRL-based local planner, incorporating checkpoints and an entity-aware reward system for social compliance.

Result: Extensive simulations show HMP-DRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in success rate, collision avoidance, and goal-reaching efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating global path planning with semantically-aware local control enhances autonomous navigation's safety and reliability in human-centric environments.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RoboMIND 2.0, a large-scale dataset with over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories for advancing robotic manipulation in diverse and challenging environments. It also proposes MIND-2, a hierarchical system for optimizing natural language instruction-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in current robotic manipulation models which struggle with generalizing to long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in complex, unstructured settings due to a lack of diverse, real-world demonstrations.

Method: The authors created RoboMIND 2.0, a dataset with over 310K dual-arm trajectories enriched with tactile data and mobile manipulation episodes, and released a simulated dataset for sim-to-real transfer. They also developed the MIND-2 framework with a high-level semantic planner and low-level Vision-Language-Action executor to handle complex robotic tasks.

Result: The RoboMIND 2.0 dataset and MIND-2 framework advance the field’s capability to generalize robotic manipulation tasks, supporting research in real-world, unstructured, and tactile-demanding environments.

Conclusion: RoboMIND 2.0 and the MIND-2 system represent significant steps in overcoming the challenges faced in robotic manipulation tasks, combining diverse data and advanced hierarchical frameworks to enable more complex task handling.

Abstract: While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.

*Sungjae Min,Hyungjoo Kim,David Hyunchul Shim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses a lightweight anthropomorphic robotic hand utilizing Bowden cables for actuation, achieving high dexterity and reduced distal mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop humanoid robotic hands that meet the conflicting requirements of high grasp force, speed, lightweight design, and dexterity within size constraints.

Method: The design employs Bowden cable-based actuation combined with rolling-contact joint optimization and antagonistic control, reducing distal mass by relocating actuators to the torso.

Result: The hand achieved dexterous tasks with fingertip forces exceeding 18N, lifted payloads over 100 times its own mass, and showed robustness under various conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods allow for lightweight, high-performance robotic hands meeting human-level dexterity requirements effectively.

Abstract: Humanoid robots toward human-level dexterity require robotic hands capable of simultaneously providing high grasping force, rapid actuation speeds, multiple degrees of freedom, and lightweight structures within human-like size constraints. Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the VLA-RAIL framework to address issues of jitter, stalling, and pauses in robotic actions by asynchronously managing model inference and motion control for smooth execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of Vision-Language-Action models in robotics, addressing the current limitations in real-time action chunk fusion that cause jitter and reduce task success rates.

Method: The paper proposes two key components: a Trajectory Smoother for noise reduction using polynomial fitting, and a Chunk Fuser to ensure continuity in position, velocity, and acceleration during transitions between action chunks.

Result: Experimental results show that VLA-RAIL reduces motion jitter, increases execution speed, and improves task success rates in dynamic simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-RAIL offers a significant advancement for VLA frameworks by enabling smoother, faster, and more reliable robotic motion, paving the way for large-scale deployment of such models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in robotic SAT tasks in unknown, cluttered environments under uncertain prior target information and limited sensor range, aiming to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose the ReSPIRe approach, which uses sigma point-based mutual information estimation, a hierarchical particle structure for uncertainty reduction, and reusable belief tree search to optimize trajectory planning.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments reveal ReSPIRe's advantages in terms of lower mutual information approximation errors, better search and tracking efficiency, and computational performance.

Conclusion: The ReSPIRe approach proves effective for SAT tasks in challenging environments, with improvements in stability, computational efficiency, and accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: Target search and tracking (SAT) is a fundamental problem for various robotic applications such as search and rescue and environmental exploration. This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-robot relative localization, notably reliability in complex environments, robust handling of sensor outliers, and efficient inter-robot measurement fusion for large teams.

Method: Developed CREPES-X with a custom hardware design featuring IR LEDs, IR camera, ultra-wideband module, and IMU. Introduced a hierarchical estimation framework: a single-frame relative estimator for instant relative poses with outlier rejection and a multi-frame estimator leveraging IMU pre-integration with coupled optimization.

Result: Validated CREPES-X through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating robustness against heavy outliers (up to 90%), and achieving high accuracy with RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817°.

Conclusion: CREPES-X is an effective and robust solution for multi-robot relative localization under challenging conditions without relying on global information.

Abstract: Relative localization is critical for cooperation in autonomous multi-robot systems. Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study presents a continuation-based learning framework for generating dynamic motions in legged robots, effectively transitioning from simplified models to full-body environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty in generating highly dynamic motions for legged robots, especially due to extensive reward tuning, high-quality demonstration needs, and model discrepancies during policy transfers.

Method: The framework involves two stages: pretraining the policy using a single rigid body model and transferring it to a full-body environment via a continuation strategy using model homotopy. This entails redistributing mass and inertia progressively between trunk and legs.

Result: The method achieves faster convergence, enhanced stability throughout the learning process, and successfully performs complex tasks like flips on both simulated and real quadrupedal robots.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in simplifying and improving the generation of complex dynamic movements for legged robots, demonstrating strong transitioning capabilities from modeling to real-world applications.

Abstract: Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.

*Qian Cheng,Weitao Zhou,Cheng Jing,Nanshan Deng,Junze Wen,Zhaoyang Liu,Kun Jiang,Diange Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSRE, a framework for real-time semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving, using latent space classification to encode safety semantics from vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the difficulty of encoding human-like semantic understanding (e.g., yielding to emergency vehicles) for autonomous driving systems, which cannot fully rely on predefined traffic rules or computationally expensive vision-language models.

Method: The proposed LSRE framework uses language-defined safety semantics from sparse VLM judgments to train a latent classifier within a recurrent world model, enabling risk assessment without constant VLM querying.

Result: Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA show LSRE achieves comparable accuracy to VLMs, with earlier hazard anticipation and significantly lower computational demands. It also generalizes to rarely seen scenarios.

Conclusion: LSRE is an effective solution for implementing semantic safety monitoring in autonomous vehicles, balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an edge ML approach using reinforcement learning (RL) and domain randomization techniques to optimize microrobot locomotion on constrained hardware, deploying trained policies for testing on both microrobots and larger robots in uneven terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, lower-latency microrobot movement under the constraints of compute, memory, and power, and to enhance locomotion effectiveness through advanced control methods like reinforcement learning.

Method: The study trains a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) RL model in simulated environments with domain randomization to bolster robustness. It applies Int8 quantization for efficient hardware deployment and connects power budgets to achievable update rates using a cycles-per-update model. A resource-aware gait scheduling approach is proposed to optimize locomotion for power-constrained devices.

Result: The MLP policy was successfully deployed on an ultra-small SoC, demonstrating effective gait scheduling and improved locomotion stability due to domain-randomized training. Testing on larger-scale robots qualitatively highlighted out-of-distribution stability improvements.

Conclusion: The integration of reinforcement learning techniques with real-time quantization optimization and resource-aware control successfully enhances microrobot locomotion. While real-world deployment shows promise, further work is required for empirical zero-shot transfer on larger robots.

Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$μ$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.

Motivation: To address the challenge of translating generative video models into low-level robotic actions for diverse object manipulation.

Method: The framework reconstructs 3D object motions from videos and utilizes these motions for trajectory tracking, enabling manipulation through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning.

Result: Dream2Flow successfully converts 3D object flows into executable commands for robots without task-specific demonstrations, demonstrated through simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D object flow interface demonstrates potential as a scalable approach for integrating video generation models with diverse robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: ArtiSG encodes human demonstrations into functional 3D scene graphs for robots, enabling accurate understanding of articulated objects for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene graphs lack the functional understanding of articulated objects necessary for robotic manipulation tasks. Limitations include visual ambiguities, inability to detect fine functional elements, and constrained estimation methods.

Method: By leveraging a portable setup to estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories under camera motion, ArtiSG encodes kinematic priors and human interaction data into a hierarchical, open-vocabulary 3D scene graph.

Result: ArtiSG outperforms baselines in detecting functional elements and estimating articulation precision, and effectively guides robots in language-directed tasks.

Conclusion: ArtiSG bridges functional understanding gaps in 3D scene graphs, enabling robots to better manipulate articulated objects in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: 3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLOs' manipulation is complex due to their high-dimensional states, deformation dynamics, and complications from obstacles in the workspace, which require effective planning and tracking methods.

Method: The framework integrates hierarchical deformation planning and neural tracking. It first generates spatial path sets satisfying homotopic constraints, then optimizes a temporal deformation sequence and employs a neural model predictive control for execution.

Result: The framework demonstrates its effectiveness in handling constrained DLO manipulation tasks through extensive validation.

Conclusion: The study confirms the framework's capacity to enhance efficiency and reliability in DLO manipulation under complex environmental constraints.

Abstract: Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Result: The proposed system achieves significant advancements over existing approaches like diffusion policies and behavior cloning in real-world tasks, emphasizing the importance of hand-eye coordination for long-term success.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable pathway for humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments, combining modular teleoperation systems and imitation learning (Choice Policy) for better coordination and performance.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unifico, a multi-ISA compiler, addressing the inefficiencies in runtime state transformations during ISA migrations, while maintaining uniform stack layouts and minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of a suitable compilation toolchain for heterogeneous-ISA processors and eliminate inefficiencies in runtime functionalities such as stack transformation.

Method: Unifico, integrated with LLVM, generates binaries with consistent stack layouts, uniform ABI, and virtual address spaces across ISAs, targeting x86-64 and ARMv8 architectures.

Result: Unifico achieves less than 6-10% execution time overhead on high-end and low-end processors respectively, reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, and removes the stack transformation overhead compared to Popcorn compiler.

Conclusion: Unifico is an effective tool for heterogeneous-ISA processors, providing efficient and practical support for ISA migrations and laying groundwork for further optimization in multi-ISA compiler designs.

Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.

Result: AgenticTCAD successfully achieved IRDS-2024 device specifications for a 2 nm nanosheet FET design within 4.2 hours, compared to 7.1 days by human experts using commercial tools.

Conclusion: AgenticTCAD proves to be a significant improvement in TCAD code generation and automated device optimization, showcasing efficiencies in both time and resource utilization.

Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.

*Yunguo Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework, addresses privacy risks and latency issues in clinical coding by combining language model reasoning, deterministic fallback, and symbolic verification, ensuring secure, reliable, and on-premise deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy concerns, latency challenges, and the unreliability of purely neural systems in healthcare clinical coding.

Method: Introducing a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework (Hybrid-Code) with a Coder agent using both a language model (BioMistral-7B) and deterministic logic, and an Auditor agent for symbolic verification against a knowledge base.

Result: The system achieved no hallucinated codes, a 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage on 1,000 MIMIC-III summaries while maintaining patient data privacy and quality control.

Conclusion: Reliability through redundancy rather than pure model performance ensures safer AI adoption in healthcare, with privacy preservation achieved via on-premise deployment.

Abstract: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.

### [353] [DEFT: Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23746)
*Wei Li,Yan Zou,Yixin Liang,José Moura,Shawn Blanton*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEFT, a new approach for automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) that treats the problem as a continuous optimization task, achieving better hard-to-detect fault detection compared to traditional tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of integrated circuits and the need to detect hard-to-detect faults have motivated the development of more effective ATPG algorithms.

Method: DEFT uses a continuous optimization framework, employing gradient-based pattern generation. It incorporates a reparameterization aligned with fault-detection semantics, CUDA optimization for deep circuit scalability, and gradient normalization.

Result: DEFT achieves 21.1%-48.9% average improvement in hard-to-detect fault detection compared to a leading tool under the same pattern budget. It also generates partial assignment patterns with fewer bits and greater fault-detection coverage.

Conclusion: DEFT offers a significant improvement in ATPG for hard-to-detect faults, complementing existing heuristic methods while demonstrating scalability and stability.

Abstract: Modern IC complexity drives test pattern growth, with the majority of patterns targeting a small set of hard-to-detect (HTD) faults. This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults. These results indicate DEFT is a promising and effective ATPG engine, offering a valuable complement to existing heuristic.

Motivation: To develop a highly efficient and compact code model that achieves comparable accuracy and safety to larger models, catering to both code generation and agent-driven workflows.

Method: Mify-Coder employs a compute-optimal strategy using a mix of high-quality curated and synthetic data refined with enterprise-grade evaluation sets and LLM-based quality filtering. Principles of CPT-SFT objectives and controlled sampling dynamics were applied in a continuous training process.

Result: Mify-Coder matches frontier-grade models in code intelligence while significantly outperforming larger baseline models in benchmarks for coding and function-calling. It promotes efficiency with effective quantization for deployment on general hardware.

Conclusion: Smaller, compute-efficient models like Mify-Coder can deliver accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance comparable to larger models, making it versatile for various environments including standard desktops.

Abstract: We present Mify-Coder, a 2.5B-parameter code model trained on 4.2T tokens using a compute-optimal strategy built on the Mify-2.5B foundation model. Mify-Coder achieves comparable accuracy and safety while significantly outperforming much larger baseline models on standard coding and function-calling benchmarks, demonstrating that compact models can match frontier-grade models in code generation and agent-driven workflows. Our training pipeline combines high-quality curated sources with synthetic data generated through agentically designed prompts, refined iteratively using enterprise-grade evaluation datasets. LLM-based quality filtering further enhances data density, enabling frugal yet effective training. Through disciplined exploration of CPT-SFT objectives, data mixtures, and sampling dynamics, we deliver frontier-grade code intelligence within a single continuous training trajectory. Empirical evidence shows that principled data and compute discipline allow smaller models to achieve competitive accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance. Quantized variants of Mify-Coder enable deployment on standard desktop environments without requiring specialized hardware.

### [355] [Uncovering Discrimination Clusters: Quantifying and Explaining Systematic Fairness Violations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23769)
*Ranit Debnath Akash,Ashish Kumar,Verya Monjezi,Ashutosh Trivedi,Gang,Tan,Saeid Tizpaz-Niari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces discrimination clustering as a generalization of individual fairness violations, aiming to uncover broader patterns of algorithmic bias using the HyFair technique, which combines formal verification and random search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While individual fairness deals with isolated instances of bias, it fails to address clustered discrimination affecting broader subgroups. The paper aims to tackle this broader class of bias.

Method: HyFair combines symbolic analysis techniques (SMT and MILP solvers) with randomized search to certify individual fairness and detect discriminatory clusters. Additionally, it introduces a novel explanation method to create interpretable decision-tree artifacts.

Result: HyFair identifies clusters of unfair outcomes based on perturbations in protected attributes, providing better performance than existing fairness verification and explanation methods.

Conclusion: The study expands fairness detection beyond pairwise disparities to systematic bias clusters, offering computational improvement and interpretability for understanding algorithmic decisions.

Abstract: Fairness in algorithmic decision-making is often framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals receive similar outcomes. A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.

*Denesa Zyberaj,Pascal Hirmer,Marco Aiello,Stefan Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in automotive software testing caused by increased system complexity and lack of systematic methodologies, offering a curated tool/technique catalog and proposing practical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to software-centric vehicle development creates higher complexity in embedded systems, requiring systematic testing methodologies that are lacking in current frameworks and constrained by legacy tools.

Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) and industry input were used to identify challenges and map them to suitable testing techniques and tools, evaluated through the PRISMA methodology.

Result: Nine recurring challenge areas were identified, and a criteria-based catalog was developed recommending strategies such as model-based planning, interoperable toolchains, and automated testing methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable recommendations and a curated catalog to inform the development of future automotive testing frameworks, addressing current limitations and enhancing practices.

Abstract: The automotive domain is shifting to software-centric development to meet regulation, market pressure, and feature velocity. This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address fairness concerns in software systems through systematic research, ensuring better integration into industrial contexts.

Method: A systematic literature mapping with a classification framework applied to 95 studies, analyzing trends, focus, and industry adoption.

Result: Fairness research is method-focused, emphasizes post-processing and group fairness, neglects early interventions, bias causes, and individual fairness. Low industry collaboration and technology readiness hinder practical adoption.

Conclusion: Fairness must span all software development stages, requiring stronger academia-industry collaboration for practical applications, forming a basis for further studies and tools.

Abstract: Context: Fairness in systems has emerged as a critical concern in software engineering, garnering increasing attention as the field has advanced in recent years. While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.

*Tao Dong,Harini Sampath,Ja Young Lee,Sherry Y. Shi,Andrew Macvean*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper emphasizes the need for evaluating LLMs beyond code correctness, focusing on nuanced collaborative behaviors for software engineering. It introduces a taxonomy of desirable behaviors and a framework for context-adaptive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs focus on code correctness but fail to capture interactive behaviors essential for human-AI collaboration in software engineering.

Method: The paper presents user-defined agent behavior taxonomy derived from 91 sets of rules and introduces the Context-Adaptive Behavior Framework using interviews and prompt analyses.

Result: Four key agent behavior expectations were identified, and the CAB framework reveals how these behaviors adapt over time and across work types.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a human-centered approach to evaluating LLMs, advocating for a shift from code correctness to measuring collaborative intelligence.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from code generators into collaborative partners for software engineers, our methods for evaluation are lagging. Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.
  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.

*Mohsen Hesamolhokama,Behnam Rohani,Amirahmad Shafiee,MohammadAmin Fazli,Jafar Habibi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional software defect prediction (SDP) methods for their reliance on static file snapshots, introducing a change-aware prediction approach with an LLM-driven framework for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDP methods primarily focus on static snapshots of files, rewarding persistence of defect labels rather than reasoning about actual code changes. This creates biased evaluations and neglects critical defect-transition cases.

Method: The paper reformulates SDP as a change-aware task, analyzing code changes across software versions. It introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven, multi-agent debate framework for improved prediction.

Result: Compared to traditional methods, the proposed framework outperforms in sensitive defect introduction scenarios, achieving more balanced performance across different subsets of code evolution.

Conclusion: This study exposes fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and advocates for change-aware reasoning in defect prediction to enhance practical relevance and accuracy.

Abstract: Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction. The source code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLM-based coding tools transform professional practice, identify associated risks, and provide insights for computing education.

Method: Qualitative analysis of 57 YouTube videos shared by practitioners, involving a filtering and quality assessment process to compare traditional and LLM-based coding practices.

Result: Practitioners noted productivity improvements, shifting challenges from implementation to code review, and concerns about code quality, ethical issues, and skill gaps for new engineers.

Conclusion: The paper recommends updating computer science curricula to emphasize problem-solving, architectural thinking, and project-based learning with LLM tools to better prepare for evolving professional workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms in software development, including vibe coding, AI-assisted coding, and agentic coding, fundamentally reshaping how software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the creation of natural language requirements by integrating formal specification patterns and AI capabilities.

Method: Utilized a three-step process: generating generalized requirement patterns, developing a natural language corpus using AI while refining attributes, and formalizing syntax based on analysis.

Result: Demonstrated the method's effectiveness on event-driven temporal requirements.

Conclusion: The method systematically combines AI tools and formal methodologies to build precise controlled natural language for requirement generation.

Abstract: Using an AI assistant, we developed a method for systematically constructing controlled natural language for requirements based on formal specification patterns containing logical attributes. The method involves three stages: 1) compiling a generalized natural language requirement pattern that utilizes all attributes of the formal specification template; 2) generating, using the AI assistant, a corpus of natural language requirement patterns, reduced by partially evaluating attributes (the developed prompt utilizes the generalized template, attribute definitions, and specific formal semantics of the requirement patterns); and 3) formalizing the syntax of the controlled natural language based on an analysis of the grammatical structure of the resulting patterns. The method has been tested for event-driven temporal requirements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoHalLo is a method for fine-grained line-level hallucination localization in AI-generated code, enabling better accuracy and efficiency than baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of fine-grained methods for identifying hallucinations in AI-generated code, leaving developers with inefficient tools for enhancing code reliability.

Method: CoHalLo probes the hidden-layer vectors of detection models, fine-tuning them on annotated datasets and utilizing a probe network to reconstruct syntactic structures for identifying hallucinated code lines.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance in hallucination localization, achieving a Top-1 accuracy of 42.53% and excelling in various evaluation metrics compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: CoHalLo offers a significant advancement in providing fine-grained hallucination localization, aiding developers in identifying and addressing AI-generated code flaws more effectively.

Abstract: The localization of code hallucinations aims to identify specific lines of code containing hallucinations, helping developers to improve the reliability of AI-generated code more efficiently. Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding how GenAI impacts BLVSPs, given their unique technical and accessibility challenges within the rapidly evolving software development industry.

Method: The study employed a qualitative approach, conducting 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs to capture their experiences and perspectives on using GenAI in work settings.

Result: The findings indicate that while GenAI improved productivity and accessibility for BLVSPs, it also came with significant challenges, such as susceptibility to AI hallucinations and restrictive organizational policies.

Conclusion: BLVSPs face a critical balance between the potential benefits and risks when integrating GenAI into their work processes, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies and support structures.

Abstract: The software development workplace poses numerous technical and collaborative accessibility challenges for blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs). Though Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly adopted within the software development industry and has been a rapidly growing topic of interest in research, to date, the unique perspectives of BLVSPs have yet to be consulted. We report on a qualitative study involving 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs about what the introduction of GenAI has meant for their work. We found that BLVSPs used GenAI for many software development tasks, resulting in benefits such as increased productivity and accessibility. However, significant costs were also accompanied by GenAI use as they were more vulnerable to hallucinations than their sighted colleagues. Sometimes, organizational policies prevented use. Based on our findings, we discuss the higher-risks and higher-returns that BLVSPs had to carefully weigh when deciding whether and when to use GenAI tools for work.

### [364] [Localized Calibrated Uncertainty in Code Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24560)
*David Gros,Prem Devanbu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to identify and correct errors in code generated by large language models (LLMs), proposing a dataset, evaluating techniques for error localization, and achieving effective calibration using small models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate code that doesn't perfectly align with user intent, necessitating corrections. The study aims to localize misalignments for more efficient error identification and code editing.

Method: The authors create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" for correcting LLM-generated code based on test cases. They then compare various techniques, including white-box and black-box methods, for predicting code errors, with a focus on probability calibration.

Result: Their approach, particularly using probes with a small supervisor model, exhibits low calibration errors and a Brier Skill Score of approximately 0.2 when estimating edited code lines from much larger language models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective methods for error localization and probability calibration in LLM-generated code. Additionally, the probe model shows potential generalizability to natural language error detection under new probability scaling conditions.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can generate complicated source code from natural language prompts. However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates five training data optimization techniques and their combinations for code generation in large language models (LLMs), identifying data synthesis and its combinations as effective strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown promising results in code generation, driven by high-quality datasets, but the effectiveness of training data optimization techniques has not been thoroughly evaluated.

Method: The study performs a large-scale empirical analysis of five data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations across three benchmarks and four LLMs, focusing on functional correctness, code quality, and maintainability.

Result: Data synthesis emerges as the most effective technique for functional correctness and reducing code smells, while combinations like synthesis and refactoring improve code quality. However, synthesis performs relatively worse on maintainability.

Conclusion: This first systematic study provides insights and practical guidance on optimizing training data and combining strategies to enhance LLM-based code generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.

TL;DR: Researchers propose Preguss, a modular framework that integrates LLMs with static analysis for automating the generation of formal specifications, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing human verification effort in large-scale software verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current large language models in efficiently handling complex, large-scale formal verification due to their struggles with long-context reasoning and inferring interprocedural specifications.

Method: The authors introduce Preguss, a framework that combines static analysis and deductive verification. Preguss uses error-guided construction for prioritizing verification and employs LLMs for synthesizing interprocedural specifications in a modular and granular manner.

Result: Preguss significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods, enabling automated RTE-freeness verification for programs exceeding 1,000 LoC. The approach reduces human verification effort by 80.6% to 88.9%.

Conclusion: The Preguss framework demonstrates the feasibility of highly automated, scalable software verification, representing a major step forward in reducing human dependency for formal specification generation.

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.

*Md Nahidul Islam Opu,Shahidul Islam,Muhammad Asaduzzaman,Shaiful Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how AI agents optimize performance in software engineering via an empirical study of pull requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how AI agents address performance concerns in software systems and their optimization behaviors.

Method: Using LLM-assisted techniques and BERTopic modeling, performance-related topics in pull requests were analyzed and categorized.

Result: AI performance optimizations were observed across software layers, influencing acceptance rates, review durations, and focus phases.

Conclusion: AI systems provide diverse performance optimizations, but focus mostly on development phase, suggesting areas for system improvement.

Abstract: LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase. Our findings provide empirical evidence that can support the evaluation and improvement of agentic AI systems with respect to their performance optimization behaviors and review outcomes.

### [368] [DynaFix: Iterative Automated Program Repair Driven by Execution-Level Dynamic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24635)
*Zhili Huang,Ling Xu,Chao Liu,Weifeng Sun,Xu Zhang,Yan Lei,Meng Yan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DynaFix introduces an automated program repair method using dynamic runtime information iteratively for better debugging and repair accuracy, leading to significant improvements in bug repair benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations in current APR methods that either lack runtime dynamic insight or fail to use iterative and fine-grained execution feedback effectively, hindering the debugging process.

Method: DynaFix implements an iterative execution-level approach that utilizes runtime data (like variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks) converted into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating patches, improving through repeated validation and feedback loops.

Result: DynaFix repaired 10% more bugs than the state-of-the-art methods in Defects4J benchmarks, including 38 bugs not previously fixed by other approaches, within fewer attempts and with a significant reduction in patch search space.

Conclusion: DynaFix is an effective and efficient method for repairing complex bugs, leveraging iterative runtime information to emulate human debugging practices and significantly improving APR performance over existing solutions.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.
  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the energy awareness of AI coding agents in software development workflows, revealing their focus on energy optimization and challenges in acceptance due to maintainability concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing importance of energy efficiency in software, driven by factors like energy-hungry language models, battery constraints, and large-scale data center demands.

Method: The authors analyzed a publicly available dataset featuring 216 energy-explicit pull requests, conducting thematic analysis and examining optimization techniques used.

Result: Most optimization techniques align with established research recommendations, showing energy awareness among AI agents, but energy-related PRs face lower acceptance rates due to maintainability issues.

Conclusion: AI coding agents demonstrate energy awareness in their outputs, but future efforts should focus on increasing acceptance rates of optimization PRs while balancing maintainability challenges.

Abstract: As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts. However, optimization-related PRs are accepted less frequently than others, largely due to their negative impact on maintainability.

*Mir Mohammad Yousuf,Shabir Ahmad Sofi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study conducts the first large-scale analysis of software defects in quantum repositories, identifying trends, causes, and solutions for bug reduction in quantum systems from 2012 to 2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive empirical evidence regarding how bugs emerge and impact real-world quantum software, thereby improving the reliability, maintainability, and performance of hybrid quantum-classical systems.

Method: A mixed-method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and rule-based classification was used to analyze 123 open-source quantum repositories and 32,296 verified bug reports.

Result: The study found that full-stack libraries and compilers are highly defect-prone, while quantum-specific bugs critically impact performance and reliability. Automated testing significantly reduces defect density and resolution time.

Conclusion: The findings offer valuable empirical insights, suggesting that tools like automated testing and refined documentation practices are essential for enhancing the quality and sustainability of quantum software projects.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.

*Ke Ma,Jianjun Huang,Wei You,Bin Liang,Jingzheng Wu,Yanjun Wu,Yuanjun Gong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MATUS mitigates noise in bug detection using feature slicing guided by prior knowledge, identifying 31 new bugs in the Linux kernel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting bugs using function similarity can be hindered by unrelated noisy statements, which existing methods fail to effectively eliminate.

Method: Proposed MATUS extracts feature slices from buggy code and targets, uses prior knowledge for slicing criteria, compares embeddings with vector similarity, and audits buggy candidates for confirmation.

Result: MATUS identified 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel, with kernel developers confirming all of them and 11 assigned CVEs.

Conclusion: MATUS proves effective in increasing precision in bug detection while maintaining efficiency, showing its value in real-world projects.

Abstract: Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.

*Zhiyong Zhang,Xiaoyan Zhang,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for improved fault tolerance and performance in railway ticketing systems, especially during high concurrency scenarios, using a microservice architecture with enhanced security measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the inefficiencies of traditional ticketing systems that fail under high user loads during peak periods, such as holidays.

Method: The methodology involves using a B/S architecture with Spring Cloud to design a microservice-based railway ticket purchase system, integrating features such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, and secure online payment functionality.

Result: The system successfully demonstrated stability, reliability, and high performance in high concurrency scenarios during testing.

Conclusion: The newly designed system effectively solves problems of traditional infrastructures, ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable operations for railway ticketing.

Abstract: The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.

TL;DR: The paper develops spiking neural networks to perform Bayesian inference, using biologically inspired spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and validates the approach on examples such as coding theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Bayesian inference models and the spike-based functioning of neural activity in the brain.

Method: Design spiking neural networks that perform message-passing-based Bayesian inference for Bernoulli messages, trained using spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

Result: The developed networks show performance comparable to true numerical solutions and successfully handle examples like unreliable channel communication.

Conclusion: Spiking neural networks can realistically implement Bayesian inference, providing biologically plausible models with practical utility in fields like coding theory.

Abstract: Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for understanding brain function, while neural activity in the brain is inherently spike-based. This paper bridges these two perspectives by designing spiking neural networks that simulate Bayesian inference through message passing for Bernoulli messages. To train the networks, we employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity which is based on the Hebbian rule. Our results demonstrate that the network's performance closely matches the true numerical solution. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a factor graph example from coding theory, illustrating signal transmission over an unreliable channel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a domain-agnostic framework for evaluating sequence learning and processing, with links to formal theories of computation, addressing the need for standardization in various cognitive and artificial intelligence fields.

Method: Introduced SymSeq for generating/analyzing symbolic sequences and SeqBench, a benchmark suite for sequence tasks. Both are based on FLT and are modular and open-access.

Result: SymSeqBench enables versatile exploration of sequential structure across fields, bridging cognitive and artificial systems and aiding experimental standardization.

Conclusion: SymSeqBench provides practical tools to apply FLT principles in research, offering accessibility and advancing understanding of sequence learning in diverse domains.

Abstract: Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is fundamentally limited by norm mismatch. Authors propose reweighting regression with stationary density ratios for improved performance without strict assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard FQE method struggles due to reliance on Bellman completeness, which constrains hypothesis classes and can impair evaluation performance.

Method: The authors suggest reweighting regression steps using stationary density ratios to mitigate norm mismatch in FQE.

Result: The proposed approach avoids geometric error blow-ups in FQE and enhances evaluation guarantees without requiring realizability or Bellman completeness.

Conclusion: This simple modification improves off-policy evaluation methods in reinforcement learning, making them robust and practical without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is a central method for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it generally requires Bellman completeness: that the hypothesis class is closed under the evaluation Bellman operator. This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the applicability of Tweedie's formula to a broader class of distributions known as elliptical distributions and establish a connection between energy scores and noisy distributions.

Method: The authors extend Tweedie's classical formula, derive a novel identity linking energy scores and noisy marginals, and explore their applications.

Result: The derived identity enables advancements in score estimation, parameter estimation of noise distributions, and flexible use of diffusion model samplers with varied noising distributions.

Conclusion: The work provides an analytical bridge between energy scoring rules and noise estimation, facilitating new capabilities in probabilistic modeling and diffusion-based frameworks.

Abstract: Denoising and score estimation have long been known to be linked via the classical Tweedie's formula. In this work, we first extend the latter to a wider range of distributions often called "energy models" and denoted elliptical distributions in this work. Next, we examine an alternative view: we consider the denoising posterior $P(X|Y)$ as the optimizer of the energy score (a scoring rule) and derive a fundamental identity that connects the (path-) derivative of a (possibly) non-Euclidean energy score to the score of the noisy marginal. This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of "traditional" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.

### [377] [Stationary Reweighting Yields Local Convergence of Soft Fitted Q-Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23927)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores issues in entropy-regularized fitted Q-iteration (soft FQI) and proposes stationary-reweighted soft FQI to address geometric mismatch and instability under function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the instability of entropy-regularized fitted Q-iteration (soft FQI) in offline reinforcement learning caused by function approximation and distribution shift.

Method: The authors introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights regression updates using the current policy's stationary distribution, ensuring local contraction and linear convergence under approximations.

Result: The proposed method achieves local linear convergence under function approximation, with insights suggesting global convergence through gradual reduction in softmax temperature, even extending to hardmax in certain conditions.

Conclusion: Stationary-reweighted soft FQI and continuation methods provide a robust approach to handling instability in entropy-based value approximation models while extending applicability under mild conditions.

Abstract: Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and its entropy-regularized variant, soft FQI, are central tools for value-based model-free offline reinforcement learning, but can behave poorly under function approximation and distribution shift. In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.

*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes γ-Flow Matching (γ-FM), a density-weighted variant of Flow Matching which enhances performance by aligning regression geometry with probability flows, addressing inefficiencies in high-dimensional spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional Flow Matching struggles with inefficiencies due to low-density void regions, where target velocity fields are chaotic or not well-defined.

Method: Introduces γ-FM, utilizing Dynamic Density-Weighting to estimate target density directly from training particles, avoiding reliance on simulation or intractable density evaluations.

Result: γ-FM improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency in high-dimensional latent datasets, demonstrating robustness to outliers.

Conclusion: Density-weighted regression utilizing γ-FM successfully mitigates inefficiencies in Flow Matching, enhancing high-dimensional flow modeling and regularizes chaotic regions efficiently.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous normalizing flows, yet standard FM implicitly performs an unweighted $L^2$ regression over the entire ambient space. In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$γ$-Flow Matching ($γ$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $γ$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $γ$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $γ$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.

Conclusion: SINNOs are shown to be an effective tool for approximating stochastic processes and could be applied to real-world problems such as predicting COVID-19 cases.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(Ω, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.

### [380] [Topological Spatial Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24327)
*Anna Calissano,Etienne Lasalle*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parameter-free method for reducing spatial graphs while maintaining their main topological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method that reduces the size of spatial graphs, which are used in various contexts like transportation networks and biological structures, while preserving their topological and spatial characteristics.

Method: The authors propose a topological spatial graph coarsening technique that collapses short edges, using a new triangle-aware graph filtration framework to adapt persistent diagrams for spatial graphs. This framework ensures the balance between reduction and topological feature preservation.

Result: The method demonstrated effective graph size reduction on synthetic and real spatial graphs while retaining important topological characteristics.

Conclusion: The new coarsening approach provides a parameter-free, rotation, translation, and scaling invariant method to simplify spatial graphs while keeping their key topological structure.

Abstract: Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.

### [381] [Improving the stability of the covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat for large-scale Bayesian sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24515)
*Jiani Wei,Xiaocheng Shang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The modified covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (mCCAdL) thermostat improves stability and numerical accuracy in Bayesian sampling for large-scale machine learning, outperforming alternative stochastic gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of the original CCAdL thermostat, specifically its numerical stability due to the moving average method and limitations in usable stepsizes.

Method: Introduce mCCAdL, using a scaling and squaring method with a truncated Taylor series for better approximation, and a symmetric splitting method for improved integration over the Euler-type approach.

Result: Numerical experiments show that mCCAdL enhances stability significantly and outperforms the original CCAdL and alternative methods in large-scale applications.

Conclusion: mCCAdL is a superior method for stable and accurate Bayesian sampling in large-scale machine learning, addressing prior limitations effectively.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.

*Sunay Joshi,Yan Sun,Hamed Hassani,Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces two algorithms, MULTIRISK-BASE and MULTIRISK, for controlling multiple risks in test-time filtering for AI systems, effectively balancing helpfulness and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing deployment of generative AI systems in real-world applications, regulating and balancing multiple dimensions of model behaviors (e.g., safety and utility) has become critical.

Method: The authors propose two dynamic programming algorithms: MULTIRISK-BASE, which selects thresholds directly for controlling risks, and MULTIRISK, which ensures simultaneous risk control using data exchangeability and finely tuned iterative risk analysis techniques.

Result: The algorithms were evaluated on a Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset. The experiments demonstrated their ability to manage each individual risk near the defined target level.

Conclusion: MULTIRISK provides a practical and efficient solution for enforcing multiple constraints and ensuring the control of risk, offering a reliable way to regulate generative AI model behavior in constrained settings.

Abstract: As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.

### [383] [Sparse Offline Reinforcement Learning with Corruption Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24768)
*Nam Phuong Tran,Andi Nika,Goran Radanovic,Long Tran-Thanh,Debmalya Mandal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse RL for high-dimensional MDPs with less samples than features, presenting actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimators that outperform traditional methods under certain assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning a near-optimal policy in high-dimensional sparse MDPs where data is corrupted and traditional techniques may fail, exploiting sparsity is essential.

Method: Proposed actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles that avoid pessimistic bonuses, offering improved guarantees under single-policy concentrability and robustness to strong contamination.

Result: First non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL in high-dimensional MDPs under single-policy concentrability, even in the presence of strong contamination.

Conclusion: Learning a near-optimal policy is achievable in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with corruption, surpassing limitations of previous robust offline RL techniques.

Abstract: We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.

### [384] [Are First-Order Diffusion Samplers Really Slower? A Fast Forward-Value Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24927)
*Yuchen Jiao,Na Li,Changxiao Cai,Gen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that higher-order methods are always superior for diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling and proposes a highly effective first-order, training-free sampler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore an alternative way to accelerate DPM sampling, beyond just increasing the solver order, by examining how placement of evaluations affects accuracy.

Method: A novel training-free, first-order sampler is created that uses a one-step lookahead for forward-value prediction and offers a different discretization error compared to DDIM.

Result: On benchmarks like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN, the proposed method improves sample quality under the same budget and occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art higher-order samplers.

Conclusion: The study suggests that evaluation placement offers a complementary and effective direction to improve diffusion sampling speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.
  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.

*Henryk Fukś*

Main category: nlin.CG

TL;DR: This paper constructs a formula to solve the initial value problem for cellular automaton rule 156, which facilitates computing densities and probabilities in its evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how the state of cellular automata evolves over time by deriving explicit formulas for their behavior, particularly for rule 156.

Method: The authors analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular automaton rule 156, decomposing them into simpler algebraic segments to construct a solution formula for the initial value problem.

Result: For rule 156, they successfully derive an explicit solution formula and use it to compute the density of ones and probabilities of longer symbol blocks after $n$ iterations.

Conclusion: The explicit solution for cellular automaton rule 156 not only solves the initial value problem but also provides a way to analyze statistical patterns like density and probabilities for random initial conditions.

Abstract: For many cellular automata, it is possible to express the state of a given cell after $n$ iterations as an explicit function of the initial configuration. We say that for such rules the solution of the initial value problem can be obtained. In some cases, one can construct the solution formula for the initial value problem by analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern generated by the rule and decomposing it into simpler segments which one can then describe algebraically. We show an example of a rule when such approach is successful, namely elementary rule 156. Solution of the initial value problem for this rule is constructed and then used to compute the density of ones after $n$ iterations, starting from a random initial condition. We also show how to obtain probabilities of occurrence of longer blocks of symbols.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reciprocal correlations in neural connectivity influence dynamic complexity, finding symmetry reduces complexity while anti-symmetry amplifies it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how partial symmetry or anti-symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics, specifically focusing on phase-space complexity and fixed points.

Method: The authors analyze random recurrent neural networks, studying the correlation between reciprocal connections and their dynamical properties through measures like Lyapunov exponents and fixed-point proliferation.

Result: Partial anti-symmetry enhances complexity, promoting high-dimensional chaotic activity, whereas partial symmetry suppresses it, enabling low-dimensional and slow-varying dynamics.

Conclusion: Connectivity reciprocity plays a crucial role in neural network behavior, influencing dynamics and providing testable predictions for understanding neural function.

Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit structured connectivity, including an overrepresentation of reciprocal connections between neuron pairs. Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity. These results yield testable predictions about the link between connection reciprocity, neural dynamics and function.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vulcan, a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate the synthesis of optimal heuristics for resource-management tasks in modern systems. Vulcan’s approach surpasses traditional, manually designed heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on hand-designed heuristics for resource management in dynamic environments is costly and inefficient, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: Vulcan employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize instance-optimal heuristics by splitting policy from mechanism, utilizing evolutionary search over LLM-generated code with task-agnostic interfaces.

Result: Vulcan synthesized heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering that outperform state-of-the-art human-designed algorithms by up to 69% and 7.9% respectively.

Conclusion: Automating heuristic generation with Vulcan’s LLM-based approach yields substantial performance improvements and addresses inefficiencies of manual design processes in dynamic systems.

Abstract: Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.
  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.
  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of conversational AI agents for mental health support in crisis situations by studying user experiences and consulting mental health experts, concluding that AI should serve as a bridge toward human connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents, such as ChatGPT or Claude, are increasingly used for mental health support. The motivation is to explore their effectiveness in extreme mental health crises and to determine how to responsibly integrate them into support systems.

Method: The study conducted a testimonial survey with 53 participants sharing lived experiences of using AI during mental health crises and interviewed 16 mental health experts to understand essential actions in these scenarios.

Result: Findings show that individuals turn to AI agents due to lack of access to professionals or fears of burdening others. Experts emphasized that human connection is crucial in managing crises, and AI intervention should focus on preparing users for positive actions.

Conclusion: Conversational AI agents should not replace human support but act as a bridge to foster human-human connections, emphasizing de-escalation of negative actions and readiness for positive intervention.

Abstract: Online, people often recount their experiences turning to conversational AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) for mental health support -- going so far as to replace their therapists. These anecdotes suggest that AI agents have great potential to offer accessible mental health support. However, it's unclear how to meet this potential in extreme mental health crisis use cases. In this work, we explore the first-person experience of turning to a conversational AI agent in a mental health crisis. From a testimonial survey (n = 53) of lived experiences, we find that people use AI agents to fill the in-between spaces of human support; they turn to AI due to lack of access to mental health professionals or fears of burdening others. At the same time, our interviews with mental health experts (n = 16) suggest that human-human connection is an essential positive action when managing a mental health crisis. Using the stages of change model, our results suggest that a responsible AI crisis intervention is one that increases the user's preparedness to take a positive action while de-escalating any intended negative action. We discuss the implications of designing conversational AI agents as bridges towards human-human connection rather than ends in themselves.

*Hongrui Jin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of large language models (LLMs) on programming via 'vibe coding,' where interactive natural language interfaces blend programming modalities but create new infrastructural dependencies and redistribute symbolic labor and power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM-driven programming reconfigures traditional programming interfaces and redistributes control through new systems of dependencies.

Method: Using materialist media theory and interface analysis, the paper reconstructs the vibe-coding stack and examines the structural implications of LLM-mediated programming.

Result: Vibe coding flattens programming interfaces into conversational surfaces while deepening infrastructural dependencies, shifting control to model and protocol providers.

Conclusion: While LLMs democratize programming access, they also create hidden complexities, dependencies, and power shifts, affecting the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interactions.

Abstract: Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of creating realistic animations without the need for extensive computing time, rendering, or animation expertise, by leveraging text-based interfaces.

Method: PhysTalk employs a large language model to generate executable code, modifying 3D Gaussian Splatting parameters in real-time with lightweight proxies and collision-aware particle dynamics.

Result: PhysTalk enables train-free, computationally efficient, open-vocabulary 4D animation without time-consuming mesh extraction, allowing for interactive, physics-driven manipulation of objects.

Conclusion: PhysTalk revolutionizes animation workflows by offering a physics-informed, dialogue-based solution for accessible, dynamic 4D animations with real-time interaction.

Abstract: Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-range structures and dependencies in English texts and how these are captured by large language models.

Method: Using conditional entropy analysis and code length distributions to examine text dependencies and studying different dynamics of language models during training for varying context lengths.

Result: Finds significant long-range dependencies in texts up to approximately 10,000 characters and shows that long-ranged structure is learned gradually during model training.

Conclusion: The results provide insight into text dependencies and constrain the development of statistical physics models for language and LLMs.

Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating free energy differences is challenging and computationally expensive. Exploring efficient and effective generative-model-based approaches can improve the process for condensed-matter systems.

Method: The study systematically reviews existing methods (such as normalizing flows and FEAT) and benchmarks them using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids in terms of metrics like accuracy, data efficiency, cost, and scalability.

Result: The study evaluates the performance of the considered methods and provides a quantitative framework for selecting optimal free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems.

Conclusion: Generative-model-based methods hold great potential for free energy estimation. The provided benchmarks guide the selection of approaches balancing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

Abstract: The accurate estimation of free energy differences between two states is a long-standing challenge in molecular simulations. Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reconstructing temporal sequences of spatiotemporal turbulent flow dynamics from sparse data, where maintaining coherence between snapshots is critical.

Method: Conditional DDPMs are employed to generate interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences. These are tested on 2D Kolmogorov Flow and 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability problems, analyzing turbulence statistics and flow characteristics.

Result: The generated sequences accurately capture time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra, temporal decay of turbulent structures, and the evolution of flow statistics in non-stationary flows.

Conclusion: The proposed DDPM-based approach is a promising generative surrogate model for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics and capturing both stationary and non-stationary flow features.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical accuracy of temporally interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences between sparse, decorrelated snapshots of turbulent flow fields using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The developed method is presented as a proof-of-concept generative surrogate for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics between sparse snapshots, demonstrated on a 2D Kolmogorov Flow, and a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). We analyse the generated flow sequences through the lens of statistical turbulence, examining the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra over generated sequences, and temporal decay of turbulent structures. For the non-stationary Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, we assess the ability of the proposed method to capture evolving flow statistics across the most strongly time-varying flow regime. We additionally examine instantaneous fields and physically motivated metrics at key stages of the KHI flow evolution.

Motivation: To create a model with non-periodic quasicrystalline Gibbs states by utilizing probabilistic cellular automata and Ammann's aperiodic tiles.

Method: A model is designed using cellular automata linked to Ammann tiles, ensuring noise resilience with a classical error-correction mechanism and adding extra dimensions.

Result: The model produces non-periodic, noise-resilient quasicrystalline Gibbs states at low temperatures.

Conclusion: The construction demonstrates stable, non-periodic quasicrystalline states in a four-dimensional lattice-gas model through innovative use of cellular automata and error correction.

Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that has non-periodic, ``quasicrystalline'' Gibbs states at low temperatures. Such Gibbs states are probability measures which are small perturbations of non-periodic ground-state configurations corresponding to tilings of the plane with Ammann's aperiodic tiles. Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling. Repetitions along two extra dimensions, together with an error-correction mechanism, ensure stability of the trajectories subjected to noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of manual recalibration for large-scale semiconductor quantum-dot arrays, a necessity due to the instability caused by electrostatic drift and charge noise.

Method: The proposed method uses charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as multidimensional probes to track charge-transition lines over time, enabling detection of voltage drifts, abrupt charge reconfigurations, and compensation to maintain stable operating conditions.

Result: The approach demonstrated robust stabilization on a 10-quantum-dot device and enabled real-time noise diagnostics, including noise power spectral density analysis, identification of two-level fluctuators, and assessment of spatial noise correlations.

Conclusion: This work establishes a scalable, autonomous calibration framework for quantum-dot arrays, enhancing the stability and functionality of QD quantum processors for high-fidelity operations.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.

### [397] [Soliton profiles: Classical Numerical Schemes vs. Neural Network - Based Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24634)
*Chandler Haight,Svetlana Roudenko,Zhongming Wang*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: This paper compares classical numerical solvers and neural network-based methods for solving one-dimensional dispersive PDEs, assessing their efficiency, accuracy, and suitability for various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of classical numerical methods versus neural network-based techniques for solving ground states and solitary-wave profiles in dispersive PDEs.

Method: The authors perform a comparative analysis using classical solvers (Petviashvili's method, finite difference with Newton iterations) and neural networks (PINNs and operator-learning methods).

Result: Classical solvers demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency in single-instance problems, while PINNs reproduced qualitative solutions but were less accurate and slower. Operator-learning methods offered fast inference after pretraining but were computationally expensive during training and less accurate for single-instance computations.

Conclusion: Classical methods are best suited for single-instance problems in one-dimensional dispersive PDEs, while neural-network methods like operator-learning may be advantageous for repeated simulations or real-time predictions.

Abstract: We present a comparative study of classical numerical solvers, such as Petviashvili's method or finite difference with Newton iterations, and neural network-based methods for computing ground states or profiles of solitary-wave solutions to the one-dimensional dispersive PDEs that include the nonlinear Schrödinger, the nonlinear Klein-Gordon and the generalized KdV equations. We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper examines the efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler in generating samples from a tilted distribution, revealing a dichotomy between bounded and unbounded distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research stems from real-world needs in areas such as finance, climate science, and rare event simulation, where generating samples from tilted distributions is crucial but challenging due to unknown underlying distributions.

Method: The authors analyze the asymptotic efficiency and provide a theoretical characterization of the performance of a self-normalized importance sampler for tilted distributions. They evaluate its efficiency based on sample size and tilt degree.

Result: The study reveals that tilting a bounded random vector requires polynomially more samples as tilt increases, whereas tilting an unbounded random vector needs samples to grow at a super-polynomial rate.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical efficiency boundary for importance samplers and underline the challenges associated with generating tilted samples, particularly when dealing with unbounded distributions.

Abstract: Consider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.

### [399] [Score-based sampling without diffusions: Guidance from a simple and modular scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24152)
*M. J. Wainwright*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving score-based sampling using modular schemes and SLC distributions for better accuracy in high-dimensional scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Score-based sampling methods exhibit strong empirical performance but rely on access to Stein score functions for noisy levels. This paper aims to make this process modular and efficient while ensuring accurate sampling in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The authors propose a modular scheme that transforms score-based sampling into a sequence of simpler sampling tasks with strongly log-concave (SLC) distributions. They design forward trajectories and utilize high-accuracy algorithms for backward conditional sampling with guarantees for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities.

Result: The method achieves $$-accurate results in KL or Wasserstein distances with polynomial growth in $$ and dimension dependence proportional to $(d).

Conclusion: This modular approach enables the use of any SLC sampling algorithm to improve sampling efficiency and accuracy, particularly for complex distributions, and demonstrates practical applicability in high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: Sampling based on score diffusions has led to striking empirical results, and has attracted considerable attention from various research communities. It depends on availability of (approximate) Stein score functions for various levels of additive noise. We describe and analyze a modular scheme that reduces score-based sampling to solving a short sequence of ``nice'' sampling problems, for which high-accuracy samplers are known. We show how to design forward trajectories such that both (a) the terminal distribution, and (b) each of the backward conditional distribution is defined by a strongly log concave (SLC) distribution. This modular reduction allows us to exploit \emph{any} SLC sampling algorithm in order to traverse the backwards path, and we establish novel guarantees with short proofs for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities. The use of high-accuracy routines yields $\varepsilon$-accurate answers, in either KL or Wasserstein distances, with polynomial dependence on $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimension.

TL;DR: The paper explores score function estimation through implicit and denoising score matching, proving adaptability to low-dimensional data and efficient convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in score function estimation for data distributions with low-dimensional structures, particularly overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

Method: Utilizes implicit and denoising score matching, supported by Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities to analyze weighted norms of smooth functions.

Result: Implicit score matching adapts to intrinsic dimensions and achieves convergence rates comparable to denoising score matching, allowing estimation of log-density Hessians without dimensionality issues.

Conclusion: The findings support efficient score function estimation methods and justify the use of ODE-based samplers in generative diffusion models.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function using both implicit score matching and denoising score matching. Assuming that the data distribution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure, we prove that implicit score matching is able not only to adapt to the intrinsic dimension, but also to achieve the same rates of convergence as denoising score matching in terms of the sample size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both methods allow us to estimate log-density Hessians without the curse of dimensionality by simple differentiation. This justifies convergence of ODE-based samplers for generative diffusion models. Our approach is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities relating weighted $L^2$-norms of smooth functions and their derivatives.

*Seunghoon Paik,Kangjie Zhou,Matus Telgarsky,Ryan J. Tibshirani*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework of basic inequalities for analyzing first-order iterative optimization algorithms and its implications on regularization and prediction risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand implicit and explicit regularization effects in first-order optimization algorithms and provide a statistical analysis tool.

Method: Develop a basic inequality framework to bound objective function differences using step sizes and distances, covering various algorithms like gradient descent and mirror descent.

Result: Enhanced understanding of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds, including refined known results and new findings for specific models and methods.

Conclusion: The framework is both versatile and practical, connecting optimization iterations to regularization coefficients and validating findings through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization. While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.

Conclusion: RAIR establishes a standardized framework for relevance evaluation, offering insights into both LLM and VLM assessment, and is now available for industry use.

Abstract: Search relevance plays a central role in web e-commerce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.

Motivation: To address the need for efficient computation resource allocation in recommender systems due to increasing model complexity and scale, maximizing business revenue while overcoming limitations of existing methods that oversimplify resource allocation.

Method: MaRCA employs centralized training with decentralized execution in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setup, alongside tools like AutoBucket TestBench for estimating computational costs and Model Predictive Control to balance revenue and costs.

Result: When deployed end-to-end in a leading e-commerce platform, MaRCA managed hundreds of billions of ad requests daily, achieving a 16.67% revenue increase without requiring extra computational resources.

Conclusion: MaRCA demonstrates its ability to optimize resource allocation efficiently while enhancing revenue, marking a significant advancement in recommender system operations for large-scale platforms.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems face significant computational challenges due to growing model complexity and traffic scale, making efficient computation allocation critical for maximizing business revenue.

MaRCA models the stages of a recommender system as cooperative agents, using Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) to optimize revenue under computation resource constraints. We introduce an AutoBucket TestBench for accurate computation cost estimation, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Revenue-Cost Balancer to proactively forecast traffic loads and adjust the revenue-cost trade-off accordingly. Since its end-to-end deployment in the advertising pipeline of a leading global e-commerce platform in November 2024, MaRCA has consistently handled hundreds of billions of ad requests per day and has delivered a 16.67% revenue uplift using existing computation resources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiGR, a hierarchical generative framework for slate recommendation that improves efficiency and recommendation quality using optimized item tokenization, hierarchical slate planning, and listwise preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing generative slate recommendation methods, such as semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks strategic slate planning.

Method: HiGR employs an auto-encoder with residual quantization for structured item tokenization, hierarchical planning involving global slate intent and item-specific selection, and a listwise preference alignment objective to optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback.

Result: HiGR demonstrates over a 10% improvement in offline recommendation quality, a 5x speedup in inference, and significant gains in Average Watch Time (1.22%) and Average Video Views (1.73%) in online A/B tests on a large-scale media platform.

Conclusion: The HiGR framework provides a more efficient and effective approach to generative slate recommendation, achieving superior offline and online performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

Abstract: Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.

TL;DR: Teachers in Brazil are enthusiastic about AI's educational potential but face challenges like limited AI literacy, training, infrastructure deficits, and lack of official curricula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Brazilian K-12 teachers' perceptions of AI in education and identify challenges for its implementation.

Method: Quantitative analysis of questionnaires from 346 educators across Brazil on their AI literacy, use, and perspectives.

Result: Most educators have limited AI knowledge but show interest in its application for teaching content, planning, and personalized learning. Structural obstacles such as training gaps and resource access hinder implementation.

Conclusion: Effective AI integration requires public policies, training, and equitable access to technology while fostering ethical and inclusive AI adoption in education.

Abstract: This study examines the perceptions of Brazilian K-12 education teachers regarding the use of AI in education, specifically General Purpose AI. This investigation employs a quantitative analysis approach, extracting information from a questionnaire completed by 346 educators from various regions of Brazil regarding their AI literacy and use. Educators vary in their educational level, years of experience, and type of educational institution. The analysis of the questionnaires shows that although most educators had only basic or limited knowledge of AI (80.3\%), they showed a strong interest in its application, particularly for the creation of interactive content (80.6%), lesson planning (80.2%), and personalized assessment (68.6%). The potential of AI to promote inclusion and personalized learning is also widely recognized (65.5%). The participants emphasized the importance of discussing ethics and digital citizenship, reflecting on technological dependence, biases, transparency, and responsible use of AI, aligning with critical education and the development of conscious students. Despite enthusiasm for the pedagogical potential of AI, significant structural challenges were identified, including a lack of training (43.4%), technical support (41.9%), and limitations of infrastructure, such as low access to computers, reliable Internet connections, and multimedia resources in schools. The study shows that Brazil is still in a bottom-up model for AI integration, missing official curricula to guide its implementation and structured training for teachers and students. Furthermore, effective implementation of AI depends on integrated public policies, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to technology, promoting ethical, inclusive, and contextually grounded adoption of AI in Brazilian K-12 education.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) predict intersectional U.S. climate opinions and identifies biases in LLM outputs compared to human survey responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inaccuracies in AI predictions for diverse public opinions could mislead policy outreach, consultation, and design, particularly in contested domains like climate change.

Method: The study compared 978 human survey responses on climate opinions to predictions made by six LLMs across 20 questions, focusing on intersectional identities.

Result: LLMs compress opinion diversity, misrepresenting concern levels for some groups, especially Black Americans, while better matching gender patterns for White and Hispanic Americans.

Conclusion: These biases in LLM predictions highlight risks for equitable climate governance and limitations of standard auditing methods for identifying nuanced intersectional inaccuracies.

Abstract: Federal agencies and researchers increasingly use large language models to analyze and simulate public opinion. When AI mediates between the public and policymakers, accuracy across intersecting identities becomes consequential; inaccurate group-level estimates can mislead outreach, consultation, and policy design. While research examines intersectionality in LLM outputs, no study has compared these outputs against real human responses across intersecting identities. Climate policy is one such domain, and this is particularly urgent for climate change, where opinion is contested and diverse. We investigate how LLMs represent intersectional patterns in U.S. climate opinions. We prompted six LLMs with profiles of 978 respondents from a nationally representative U.S. climate opinion survey and compared AI-generated responses to actual human answers across 20 questions. We find that LLMs appear to compress the diversity of American climate opinions, predicting less-concerned groups as more concerned and vice versa. This compression is intersectional: LLMs apply uniform gender assumptions that match reality for White and Hispanic Americans but misrepresent Black Americans, where actual gender patterns differ. These patterns, which may be invisible to standard auditing approaches, could undermine equitable climate governance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the search for less discriminatory algorithms (LDAs) in domains like employment, credit, and housing, proposing a method to determine when the search can be stopped in good faith.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for reducing disparate impact in decision systems for high-stakes areas while ensuring fairness among social groups.

Method: The authors formalize the LDA search as an optimal stopping problem and introduce an adaptive stopping algorithm to upper bound potential gains from continued search.

Result: The proposed method effectively certifies when the search for LDAs is sufficient, validated using real-world datasets from credit, employment, and housing.

Conclusion: The framework allows developers to justify their search efforts in finding less discriminatory algorithms and ensures robust and fair decision-making in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Recent scholarship has argued that firms building data-driven decision systems in high-stakes domains like employment, credit, and housing should search for "less discriminatory algorithms" (LDAs) (Black et al., 2024). That is, for a given decision problem, firms considering deploying a model should make a good-faith effort to find equally performant models with lower disparate impact across social groups. Evidence from the literature on model multiplicity shows that randomness in training pipelines can lead to multiple models with the same performance, but meaningful variations in disparate impact. This suggests that developers can find LDAs simply by randomly retraining models. Firms cannot continue retraining forever, though, which raises the question: What constitutes a good-faith effort? In this paper, we formalize LDA search via model multiplicity as an optimal stopping problem, where a model developer with limited information wants to produce strong evidence that they have sufficiently explored the space of models. Our primary contribution is an adaptive stopping algorithm that yields a high-probability upper bound on the gains achievable from a continued search, allowing the developer to certify (e.g., to a court) that their search was sufficient. We provide a framework under which developers can impose stronger assumptions about the distribution of models, yielding correspondingly stronger bounds. We validate the method on real-world credit, employment and housing datasets.

TL;DR: Community-IM++ is a scalable algorithm for Influence Maximization, achieving near-greedy influence spread with significantly reduced runtime by modeling inter-community diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the limitation of traditional community-based IM approaches which assume independence between communities, making them ineffective in real-world networks.

Method: The algorithm uses a heuristic built on community-based diffusion degree (CDD), partitions the network, prioritizes nodes that bridge communities, and allocates seeds adaptively. Lazy evaluation is used to reduce redundant computations.

Result: Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread up to 100 times faster than other methods, outperforming competing algorithms across different budgets and network structures.

Conclusion: Community-IM++ is effective and practical for large-scale applications, offering efficient solutions for contexts like viral marketing or public health campaigns requiring cross-community influence.

Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) seeks to identify a small set of seed nodes in a social network to maximize expected information spread under a diffusion model. While community-based approaches improve scalability by exploiting modular structure, they typically assume independence between communities, overlooking inter-community influence$\unicode{x2014}$a limitation that reduces effectiveness in real-world networks. We introduce Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community diffusion through a principled heuristic based on community-based diffusion degree (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy. The algorithm partitions the network, computes CDD to prioritize bridging nodes, and allocates seeds adaptively across communities using lazy evaluation to minimize redundant computations. Experiments on large real-world social networks under different edge weight models show that Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread at up to 100 times lower runtime, while outperforming Community-IM and degree heuristics across budgets and structural conditions. These results demonstrate the practicality of Community-IM++ for large-scale applications such as viral marketing, misinformation control, and public health campaigns, where efficiency and cross-community reach are critical.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for secure semantic communications, balancing task performance for multiple receivers and reducing sensitive data leakage to eavesdroppers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance security in semantic communication systems by addressing the risk of sensitive information leakage to unintended receivers.

Method: The framework uses min-max optimization to train legitimate transmitter-receiver pairs while limiting an eavesdropper's semantic inference. An auxiliary perturbation layer further degrades semantic leakage.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved task performance for legitimate receivers, while significantly reducing the eavesdropper's inference accuracy over wireless channels using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust solution for secure semantic communications with tunable privacy against adaptive adversaries, paving the way for secure next-gen wireless systems.

Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to update VM placement and routing dynamically. LLM-based extractors yield higher accuracy, while Sentence-BERT classifiers achieve lower latency for real-time use.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines NLP intent extraction with optimization techniques, providing a safe, interpretable, and intuitive solution for virtual network management.

Abstract: This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.

### [413] [Quantitative Understanding of PDF Fits and their Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24116)
*Amedeo Chiefa,Luigi Del Debbio,Richard Kenway*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze the training dynamics of neural networks employed in Parton Distribution Function (PDF) determinations, offering insights into training processes and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With high-precision experimental data from LHC, it is crucial to have a robust method for PDF determination that aligns with this precision. This study aims to improve the understanding and reliability of neural network-based PDF techniques.

Method: Using NTK theory, the authors develop an analytical framework to describe how neural networks evolve during training, focusing on their architecture, training dynamics, and uncertainty propagation from experimental data.

Result: The findings provide an analytical understanding of neural network training in the context of PDF determination, offering quantitative diagnostics of uncertainty propagation and model architecture influences.

Conclusion: While not a replacement for traditional PDF fitting, the NTK-based analysis serves as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the robustness of PDF methodologies and offers broader applications for analyzing machine learning processes in physics.

Abstract: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a central role in describing experimental data at colliders and provide insight into the structure of nucleons. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated deep learning approach for monitoring high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes to predict GLOFs using Sentinel-1 SAR data, achieving high accuracy and offering a scalable, operational system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of current GLOF monitoring methods, which prioritize spatial over temporal resolution and struggle with cloud cover in optical imagery, by introducing a focused and automated monitoring solution.

Method: A "temporal-first" training strategy is used with a U-Net and EfficientNet-B3 backbone on Sentinel-1 SAR data, combined with an operational and automated engineering pipeline for data ingestion and result dissemination.

Result: The proposed model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9130, signifying its effectiveness in monitoring glacial lakes, and the system facilitates dynamic early warning capabilities.

Conclusion: The combination of the proposed deep learning model and automated pipeline offers a significant transition from static GLOF monitoring to dynamic early warning, setting a benchmark for scalable climate hazard systems.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.

*Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Jingyu Xu,Fangqiu Yi,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Video Compression (GVC), a framework achieving extreme video compression rates with generative models, enabling practical video communication under strict bandwidth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of achieving extreme video compression rates as low as 0.01%, addressing bandwidth-constrained scenarios for effective video communication.

Method: The method involves encoding videos into ultra-compact representations, relying on powerful generative priors at the receiver's end to reconstruct video content effectively, with a proposed compression-computation trade-off for deployment on consumer-grade GPUs.

Result: GVC achieves a unique balance of extreme compression and computation, reaching a rate of 0.02% in certain cases, allowing practical deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: The study confirms GVC's potential as a scalable, efficient, and deployable paradigm for video communication, suitable for applications like rescue operations, surveillance, and mobile edge computing.

Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the self-supervised ultrasound model USF-MAE for first-trimester fetal heart view classification and shows its superior performance over supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automating early detection of congenital heart disease through first-trimester fetal echocardiography, including small structures, low signal-to-noise ratios, and inter-operator variability.

Method: The authors use USF-MAE, a self-supervised Vision Transformer based on masked autoencoding pretraining on 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, fine-tuned on a dataset of 6,720 labeled fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories.

Result: USF-MAE outperformed baseline models (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ViT-B/16) on all evaluation metrics with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score, improving accuracy and F1-score by +2% compared to the top baseline.

Conclusion: USF-MAE offers a reliable automated approach for first-trimester fetal echocardiography by achieving high classification performance without aggressive preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

*Ruiyang Zhao,Fan Lam*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learned feature-based approach for reconstructing multidimensional MRI data, employing a novel disentanglement technique and latent diffusion model for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing multidimensional MRI data, particularly when limited task-specific data is available for training.

Method: The method uses an encoder-decoder network for feature disentanglement, style-based decoder design, latent diffusion model, and novel reconstruction algorithms integrating zero-shot self-supervised learning and subspace modeling.

Result: Implemented on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, the proposed method outperformed current state-of-the-art techniques without requiring supervised training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the potential for improved multidimensional MRI reconstruction leveraging learned representations and novel algorithms, suitable for cases with limited training data.

Abstract: We present a new approach for representing and reconstructing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.

*Hunor Csala,Sebastian De Pascuale,Paul Laiu,Jeremy Lore,Jae-Sun Park,Pei Zhang*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based surrogate model for speeding up simulations of plasma edge dynamics in fusion devices, reducing computational cost significantly compared to conventional codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing plasma-facing components in fusion reactors requires accurate and computationally feasible modeling of plasma edge dynamics.

Method: Transformer-based autoregressive surrogates trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data to predict plasma edge state fields such as electron temperature, density, and radiated power.

Result: The surrogate model provides stable, accurate predictions over extended timescales and is orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods, though its performance declines in unrepresented physical regimes.

Conclusion: This surrogate model enables rapid parameter exploration and control-oriented studies, paving the way for real-time applications in fusion device scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor-edge dynamics is vital for designing plasma-facing components in fusion devices. High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices.

*Maxime Lucet,Nawal Benabbou,Aurélie Beynier,Nicolas Maudet*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces algorithms for multilevel fair resource allocation in tree-structured hierarchies and assesses their fairness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and efficiency in resource allocation within tree-structured agent hierarchies, which is common in real-world scenarios but poses multiple design challenges.

Method: The paper proposes two algorithms: a sequential top-down polynomial-time algorithm with theoretical fairness and efficiency guarantees, and an extension of General Yankee Swap suitable for multilevel settings, tested empirically for fairness.

Result: The sequential algorithm provides both fairness and efficiency characteristics, while the General Yankee Swap extension offers strong practical fairness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively balance fairness and efficiency in tree-structured allocation problems, offering practical and theoretical insights for hierarchical resource distribution.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of multilevel fair allocation of resources with tree-structured hierarchical relations among agents. While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.

*Lei Liu,Yuhao Chi,Shunqi Huang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces random multiplexing for wireless communication, ensuring robust performance in dynamic scenarios by decoupling from physical channel structures and optimizing detector performance and power allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiplexing techniques like OTFS and AFDM are limited in dynamic, high-mobility wireless environments due to their dependence on specific channel structures. A more robust method is needed to ensure reliable communication.

Method: The proposed method employs random multiplexing that is independent of physical channels. It introduces an input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain, combined with a low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector and optimized power allocations to enhance performance.

Result: Random multiplexing ensures statistical fading-channel ergodicity and achieves asymptotic MAP BER optimality in linear systems. Power allocations and optimal coding principles are derived to maximize constrained capacity and detector performance.

Conclusion: Random multiplexing is a versatile and efficient technique for high-mobility wireless applications, offering robust and optimal performance even in arbitrary and complex channel conditions.

Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the application of various Large Language Models (LLMs) to stock selection for sector-based portfolio construction, showing promising but market-dependent performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how generative AI (LLMs) can enhance stock selection and portfolio performance within sector indices, particularly in quantitative finance.

Method: LLMs from five providers were tasked with selecting and weighting stocks from the S&P 500 sector indices. Performance was evaluated using classical portfolio optimization during stable and volatile market phases.

Result: LLM-selected portfolios outperformed traditional indices in stable conditions but underperformed in volatile markets. Combining LLM insights with optimization techniques led to better and more consistent outcomes.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in investment management, but their effectiveness is influenced by market conditions. Integrating them with traditional finance techniques can yield more adaptive and reliable investment strategies.

Abstract: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).
  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.
  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.

TL;DR: The paper develops a statistical test to detect lookahead bias in economic forecasts generated by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure the validity and reliability of economic forecasts made by LLMs by identifying potential biases in their predictions.

Method: The authors introduced a measure called Lookahead Propensity (LAP), which estimates the likelihood that a forecast prompt appeared in an LLM's training data. They then use LAP to detect positive correlations with prediction accuracy as evidence of lookahead bias.

Result: By applying the proposed test to two forecasting tasks, the authors successfully demonstrated how their tool could identify lookahead biases in LLM forecasts in a cost-efficient way.

Conclusion: The developed test provides an effective and diagnostic approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of LLM-generated forecasts in economic tasks.

Abstract: We develop a statistical test to detect lookahead bias in economic forecasts generated by large language models (LLMs). Using state-of-the-art pre-training data detection techniques, we estimate the likelihood that a given prompt appeared in an LLM's training corpus, a statistic we term Lookahead Propensity (LAP). We formally show that a positive correlation between LAP and forecast accuracy indicates the presence and magnitude of lookahead bias, and apply the test to two forecasting tasks: news headlines predicting stock returns and earnings call transcripts predicting capital expenditures. Our test provides a cost-efficient, diagnostic tool for assessing the validity and reliability of LLM-generated forecasts.

*Brandon Robinson*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Neural Network Field Theory (NN-FT) capable of encoding full 2D Conformal Field Theory (CFT) Virasoro symmetry and explores its extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation in traditional NN-FTs in encoding local conformal symmetries and constructing a NN-FT that achieves the infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry seen in 2D CFTs.

Method: The authors design a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor using specific architectures and parameter priors, perform numerical simulations to validate predictions, and construct extensions for super-Virasoro symmetry and boundary NN-FTs.

Result: The paper demonstrates the first-ever NN-FT encoding full Virasoro symmetry, computes central charges and scaling dimensions, extends to $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry, and preserves symmetries in boundary NN-FTs.

Conclusion: This work builds a framework for modeling infinite-dimensional conformal symmetries in NN-based frameworks, opening expansions for (super-)conformal symmetry studies in neural field models.

Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) can realize global conformal symmetries via embedding space architectures. These models describe Generalized Free Fields (GFFs) in the infinite width limit. However, they typically lack a local stress-energy tensor satisfying conformal Ward identities. This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.

Motivation: The pressure on observatories due to increasing proposal volumes demands improvements in peer review processes, focusing on fairness, consistency, and scalability.

Method: AstroReview applies a three-stage agent-based framework for proposal reviews: novelty/scientific merit, feasibility/expected yield, and meta-review/reliability verification.

Result: AstroReview achieved 87% accuracy in identifying accepted proposals during tests, and revised proposals showed a 66% increase in acceptance rates after two feedback iterations.

Conclusion: AstroReview offers an effective solution for scalable and transparent proposal reviews, enhancing efficiency at resource-constrained observatories.

Abstract: Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.

### [426] [A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23906)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal patch-based Transformer model to enhance next-epoch prediction of ground displacement using InSAR data, yielding state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasingly, urban planning, infrastructure management, and hazard mitigation require real-time ground deformation monitoring. Existing approaches like InSAR and EGMS provide historical data but lack prediction capabilities, necessitating new predictive models.

Method: The study introduces a multimodal Transformer model for nowcasting displacement maps by integrating recent displacement snapshots, static kinematic indicators, and harmonic encodings over localized grids (64x64). It compares this model's performance with other approaches such as CNN-LSTM and STGCN.

Result: The multimodal Transformer outperformed competing methods, achieving the best predictive performance (RMSE = 0.90 mm, R² = 0.97) for next-epoch displacement prediction on a test set from Ireland.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the multimodal Transformer for accurate regional deformation predictions, making it a promising tool for enhancing monitoring of ground deformation at regional scales in real-time scenarios.

Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

### [427] [OptiVote: Non-Coherent FSO Over-the-Air Majority Vote for Communication-Efficient Distributed Federated Learning in Space Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24334)
*Anbang Zhang,Chenyuan Feng,Wai Ho Mow,Jia Ye,Shuaishuai Guo,Geyong Min,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces OptiVote, a robust and energy-efficient framework for federated learning and computation in space data centers using free-space optical communication without requiring precise phase alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges of distributed federated learning in space data centers where communication links are bandwidth-constrained and highly dynamic due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects.

Method: The authors propose OptiVote as a solution that integrates sign stochastic gradient descent, majority-vote aggregation, and pulse-position modulation for non-coherent aggregation via optical intensity combining.

Result: OptiVote eliminates phase alignment requirements, achieves resilience to channel impairments through dynamic power control, and provides theoretical convergence guarantees under statistical challenges.

Conclusion: OptiVote enables effective federated learning in space environments by solving communication challenges, making it suitable for implementation in dynamic inter-satellite systems.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper develops an unsupervised convolutional autoencoder for anomaly detection in optical TPC data to efficiently extract Regions of Interest with minimal processing and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for real-time data selection in optical TPCs, which produce megapixel-scale images critical for rare-event searches but require efficient processing due to their large size.

Method: The authors propose using a convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images to learn detector noise patterns without labels or simulations. It localizes anomalies through reconstruction residuals and extracts compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) via thresholding and clustering.

Result: The approach successfully retains 93% of signal intensity while discarding 97.8% of the image area with a 25 ms inference time per frame on a consumer GPU. Two autoencoder configurations were compared, highlighting the importance of the training objective.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that pedestal-trained autoencoders enable effective, transparent, and detector-agnostic online data reduction for optical TPCs, emphasizing the critical role of training objective design.

Abstract: Optical-readout Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) produce megapixel-scale images whose fine-grained topological information is essential for rare-event searches, but whose size challenges real-time data selection. We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents q3-MuPa, a novel framework leveraging silent 3D MRI (MuPa-ZTE) and diffusion model-based qMRI mapping for efficient, accurate, and noise-reduced imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve patient comfort, motion robustness, and efficiency in qMRI mapping while achieving better image quality and structural detail preservation.

Method: Used 3D MuPa-ZTE scanning paired with a diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and integrated physics-based data consistency during inference. The models were trained on synthetic data.

Result: q3-MuPa achieved high accuracy in T1, T2, and proton density mappings with reduced noise and better structural detail while generalizing well to real scans.

Conclusion: q3-MuPa offers rapid and precise qMRI mapping, demonstrating strong clinical potential for efficient and more patient-friendly imaging.

Abstract: The 3D fast silent multi-parametric mapping sequence with zero echo time (MuPa-ZTE) is a novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) acquisition that enables nearly silent scanning by using a 3D phyllotaxis sampling scheme. MuPa-ZTE improves patient comfort and motion robustness, and generates quantitative maps of T1, T2, and proton density using the acquired weighted image series. In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based qMRI mapping method that leverages both a deep generative model and physics-based data consistency to further improve the mapping performance. Furthermore, our method enables additional acquisition acceleration, allowing high-quality qMRI mapping from a fourfold-accelerated MuPa-ZTE scan (approximately 1 minute). Specifically, we trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, and we incorporated the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as an explicit data consistency (DC) constraint during inference. We compared our mapping method against a baseline dictionary matching approach and a purely data-driven diffusion model. The diffusion models were trained entirely on synthetic data generated from digital brain phantoms, eliminating the need for large real-scan datasets. We evaluated on synthetic data, a NISM/ISMRM phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with brain metastases. The results demonstrated that our method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise and better preservation of structural details. Notably, it generalised well to real scans despite training on synthetic data alone. The combination of the MuPa-ZTE acquisition and our physics-informed diffusion model is termed q3-MuPa, a quick, quiet, and quantitative multi-parametric mapping framework, and our findings highlight its strong clinical potential.

TL;DR: The researchers investigate the dynamics of integrate-and-fire neurons, deriving equations to model neuronal states and inter-spike intervals, even under non-stationary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework that captures the detailed joint dynamics of membrane potential and inter-spike intervals, useful for understanding neuronal behavior under complex conditions like network oscillations or external input.

Method: The study utilizes a population density framework to formulate a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, along with hierarchical equations for ISI moments. A perturbative expansion around stationary states is applied for deriving linear response to weak input modulations.

Result: The approach allows characterization of time-dependent ISI distributions in non-stationary systems and derives analytic expressions for linear response to weak inputs.

Conclusion: The framework enables a deeper understanding of neuronal population dynamics, especially under time-variant conditions, bridging theory and real neuronal behavior.

Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of membrane potential and time since the last spike in a population of integrate-and-fire neurons using a population density framework. This leads to a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that captures the evolution of the full neuronal state, along with a one-dimensional hierarchy of equations for the moments of the inter-spike interval (ISI). The formalism allows us to characterize the time-dependent ISI distribution, even when the population is far from stationarity, such as under time-varying external input or during network oscillations. By performing a perturbative expansion around the stationary state, we also derive an analytic expression for the linear response of the ISI distribution to weak input modulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe and robust real-time navigation of over-actuated marine vessels, especially under strong environmental disturbances and with limited onboard computational resources.

Method: The framework integrates SMC for disturbance robustness, HOCBFs for obstacle-avoidance constraint enforcement, and a lightweight projection method to adapt the controller minimally and reduce chattering.

Result: The system demonstrates robust and efficient navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational feasibility on nonlinear marine vessel simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed SMC-HOCBF framework is a strong solution for safety-critical control in small marine robots and vessels with limited computational resources, offering computational efficiency and robust obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel safe control framework that integrates Sliding Mode Control (SMC), High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with state-dependent adaptiveness and a lightweight projection for collision-free navigation of an over-actuated 3-DOF marine surface vessel subjected to strong environmental disturbances (wind, waves, and current). SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safety in mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems by leveraging energy constraints with high-probability guarantees, using dynamics learned via Gaussian processes.

Method: Develop a Bayesian control barrier function (CBF) framework which constructs energy-aware CBFs leveraging GP Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, ensuring minimal modification to nominal controllers.

Result: Constructed energy-based CBFs (EB-CBFs) that offer probabilistic energy safety guarantees and were validated through numerical simulations on a mass-spring system.

Conclusion: The proposed EB-CBFs effectively ensure high-probability safety for dynamical systems under uncertain Gaussian process dynamics.

Abstract: We study safe control for dynamical systems whose continuous-time dynamics are learned with Gaussian processes (GPs), focusing on mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems where safety is naturally expressed via energy constraints. The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system demonstrate that the proposed EB-CBFs achieve high-probability safety under noisy sampled GP-learned dynamics.

*Bo Li,Zijun Chen,Haiwang Zhong,Di Cao,Guangchun Ruan*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an auxiliary task learning method using graph neural networks to reconstruct missing PMU data effectively under high missing rates and incomplete observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing methods for handling missing PMU data, including concept drift, robustness issues, and reliance on full observability, which are unrealistic in wide-area measurement systems.

Method: The paper uses a K-hop graph neural network for learning on subgraphs with PMU nodes and introduces an auxiliary learning framework with two graph networks leveraging spatial-temporal dependencies and low-rank properties of PMU data.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior offline and online performance in reconstructing missing PMU data, particularly under conditions of high missing rates and incomplete observability.

Conclusion: The auxiliary task learning method with graph neural networks provides a robust and adaptive solution for PMU data reconstruction, addressing challenges like high missing rates and concept drift effectively.

Abstract: In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.

Result: The proposed unsupervised SNN achieves 80% test accuracy, comparable to supervised deep learning methods, while significantly reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: SNNs present a viable solution for resource-efficient UWB channel estimation, enabling accurate and low-complexity neuromorphic deployment.

Abstract: Although existing deep learning-based Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) channel estimation methods achieve high accuracy, their computational intensity clashes sharply with the resource constraints of low-cost edge devices. Motivated by this, this letter explores the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this task and develops a fully unsupervised SNN solution. To enable a comprehensive performance analysis, we devise an extensive set of comparative strategies and evaluate them on a compelling public benchmark. Experimental results show that our unsupervised approach still attains 80% test accuracy, on par with several supervised deep learning-based strategies. Moreover, compared with complex deep learning methods, our SNN implementation is inherently suited to neuromorphic deployment and offers a drastic reduction in model complexity, bringing significant advantages for future neuromorphic practice.

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning that handles transition uncertainty. It provides a unified general framework, develops a Bayesian DP algorithm, and validates advantages in risk-sensitivity and robustness with theoretical and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to incorporate robustness against transition uncertainty in reinforcement learning while addressing randomness in states, costs, and transition dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a framework defining inner and outer risk measures, derive a Bellman equation for a Risk-Sensitive Robust Markov Decision Process (RSRMDP), and develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming algorithm using Monte Carlo sampling and convex optimization.

Result: The paper demonstrates strong consistency, convergence to near-optimal policies, and advantages in risk-sensitivity and robustness through numerical experiments and option hedging applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and methods provide practical, robust, and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning approaches with proven theoretical consistency and empirical effectiveness.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes fairness and accuracy trade-offs in insurance pricing, proposes a multi-objective optimization framework using NSGA-II, and highlights balanced compromises among competing fairness and accuracy criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insurance pricing faces challenges balancing predictive accuracy and fairness across various criteria, necessitating improved models that address these conflicting requirements comprehensively.

Method: A multi-objective optimization framework using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to jointly optimize accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness, creating diverse trade-off solutions.

Result: XGBoost provides higher accuracy but worsens fairness, Orthogonal models excel in group fairness, and Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness. The proposed framework outperforms single-model approaches, achieving balanced outcomes.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the efficacy of multi-objective optimization in reconciling conflicting fairness and accuracy goals, providing superior trade-offs in insurance pricing.

Abstract: Machine learning improves predictive accuracy in insurance pricing but exacerbates trade-offs between competing fairness criteria across different discrimination measures, challenging regulators and insurers to reconcile profitability with equitable outcomes. While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness. Our method consistently achieves a balanced compromise, outperforming single-model approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) often hallucinate, failing to generate text grounded in audio inputs. This paper aims to analyze and mitigate these grounding failures.

Method: The AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework with counterfactual hard negative mining constructs a preference dataset. AHA-Eval is a benchmark to test fine-grained temporal reasoning. The improvements are applied to Qwen2.5-Omni, producing Qwen-Audio-AHA.

Result: Qwen-Audio-AHA achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval and notable performance enhancements on public datasets (MMAU-Test: 1.3%, MMAR: 1.6%), surpassing SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The introduced framework successfully mitigates hallucination issues in LALMs, improves grounding and reasoning capabilities, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-language models, while enabling advanced multimodal reasoning, pose new vulnerabilities. This work explores the potential for encoder-level attacks to exploit weaknesses in these systems.

Method: The authors develop a universal perturbation method that targets the latent representations at the encoder level of audio-language models. The attack generalizes across different inputs and speakers without requiring access to the language model itself.

Result: The proposed attack achieves consistently high success rates on Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct while introducing minimal perceptual distortion.

Conclusion: Encoder-level attacks represent a significant and underexplored security threat for multimodal systems, emphasizing the need for better defensive strategies.

Abstract: Audio-language models combine audio encoders with large language models to enable multimodal reasoning, but they also introduce new security vulnerabilities. We propose a universal targeted latent space attack, an encoder-level adversarial attack that manipulates audio latent representations to induce attacker-specified outputs in downstream language generation. Unlike prior waveform-level or input-specific attacks, our approach learns a universal perturbation that generalizes across inputs and speakers and does not require access to the language model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhyAVBench, a benchmark to evaluate Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) models' understanding of audio physics for generating realistic audio-visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2AV models fall short in generating physically plausible sounds due to a lack of understanding of physical principles, necessitating the need to assess their physics-based audio capabilities.

Method: The authors present PhyAVBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 paired text prompts that evaluate six major audio physics dimensions in various scenarios, with robust quality control involving human evaluation.

Result: PhyAVBench systematically evaluates T2AV models’ capabilities in physical sound generation, providing insights into their audio-physics sensitivity and improving their adherence to real-world acoustic conditions.

Conclusion: This work argues for the significance of physical principles in T2AV systems and anticipates that PhyAVBench will drive advancements in generating physically consistent audio-visual content.

Abstract: Text-to-audio-video (T2AV) generation underpins a wide range of applications demanding realistic audio-visual content, including virtual reality, world modeling, gaming, and filmmaking. However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVBench, a challenging audio physics-sensitivity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the audio physics grounding capabilities of existing T2AV models. PhyAVBench comprises 1,000 groups of paired text prompts with controlled physical variables that implicitly induce sound variations, enabling a fine-grained assessment of models' sensitivity to changes in underlying acoustic conditions. We term this evaluation paradigm the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST). Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily focus on audio-video synchronization, PhyAVBench explicitly evaluates models' understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying sound generation, covering 6 major audio physics dimensions, 4 daily scenarios (music, sound effects, speech, and their mix), and 50 fine-grained test points, ranging from fundamental aspects such as sound diffraction to more complex phenomena, e.g., Helmholtz resonance. Each test point consists of multiple groups of paired prompts, where each prompt is grounded by at least 20 newly recorded or collected real-world videos, thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage during model pre-training. Both prompts and videos are iteratively refined through rigorous human-involved error correction and quality control to ensure high quality. We argue that only models with a genuine grasp of audio-related physical principles can generate physically consistent audio-visual content. We hope PhyAVBench will stimulate future progress in this critical yet largely unexplored domain.

*Mohsen Annabestani,Samira Aghadoost,Anais Rameau,Olivier Elemento,Gloria Chia-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders using acoustic features from vowel phonations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benign laryngeal voice disorders are widespread and often indicate broader physiological dysfunction, necessitating improved tools for diagnosis and monitoring.

Method: A three-stage hierarchical machine learning approach is introduced, employing CNN-derived mel-spectrogram features, interpretable acoustic biomarkers, and a support vector machine for classification.

Result: The framework outperformed other models and methods, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and achieving better classification results for voice disorders.

Conclusion: This approach has the potential to improve scalable, non-invasive screening and monitoring of vocal health using quantitative voice biomarkers.

Abstract: Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.

*Wenye Li,Hongxu Chen,Jiacai Liu,Ke Wei*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper investigates Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) under the Markovian sampling model using Temporal Difference (TD) learning, presenting two algorithms with sample complexity improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the sample complexity of PMD methods under the more realistic Markovian sampling model without explicit action value approximation, addressing gaps in existing research.

Method: This study develops two algorithms, Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD, which are off-policy and mixed-policy methods, characterizing their sample complexity for different policy update step sizes.

Result: Algorithms achieve a sample complexity of \(\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})\) for achieving average-time \(\varepsilon\)-optimality, which improves to \(O(\varepsilon^{-2})\) using adaptive policy update step sizes for last-iterate \(\varepsilon\)-optimality.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance the understanding of PMD under the Markovian sampling model, providing stronger sample complexity guarantees through adaptive step size and TD integration.

Abstract: This paper studies the policy mirror descent (PMD) method, which is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning and can cover a wide range of policy gradient methods by specifying difference mirror maps. Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\varepsilon$-optimality. The sample complexity is further improved to $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (without the hidden logarithm factor) to achieve the last-iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality based on adaptive policy update step sizes.

### [443] [A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676)
*Kuangyu Ding,Marie Maros,Gesualdo Scutari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper develops a decentralized optimization framework, MP-Jacobi, combining message passing and Jacobi updates for nonlinear programs with graph/hypergraph-based variable interactions and proves its convergence and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization frameworks often require efficient and scalable methods to solve nonlinear programs where decision variables interact via complex graph or hypergraph structures.

Method: The MP-Jacobi framework integrates graph-compliant min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates, enabling parallel updates using tree clusters and single-hop communication. Approximation surrogates are introduced to reduce complexity.

Result: The method achieves global linear convergence for strongly convex objectives, providing explicit scalability rates and improved computational efficiency in experiments.

Conclusion: MP-Jacobi enhances decentralized optimization, handles graph/hypergraph interactions effectively, and outperforms gradient-based baselines in both theory and practice.

Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.
  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.

*Theodore MacMillan,Nicholas T. Ouellette*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the interpretability of GraphCast, a data-driven physics model, using tools adapted from Large Language Model research to identify meaningful intermediate features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of the internal operations of large data-driven physics models like GraphCast, and there is a need to assess their interpretability and physical consistency.

Method: Sparse autoencoders were used to analyze intermediate computational layers of GraphCast, extracting interpretable features related to weather phenomena and geographical coding.

Result: Distinct, interpretable features were identified that correspond to specific weather patterns, seasonal behaviors, and environmental elements, with the model's behavior validated through controlled interventions.

Conclusion: These insights into GraphCast’s operations improve its transparency, demonstrating its potential as a reliable and scientifically valuable tool for predicting dynamic weather systems.

Abstract: Large data-driven physics models like DeepMind's weather model GraphCast have empirically succeeded in parameterizing time operators for complex dynamical systems with an accuracy reaching or in some cases exceeding that of traditional physics-based solvers. Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.

*Chenguang Liu,Antonis Papapantoleon,Jasper Rou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper establishes the mathematical foundation for using deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) to solve high-dimensional PDEs, demonstrating that generalization error approaches zero as both neuron count and training time increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a rigorous and quantifiable basis for applying deep gradient flow methods to solve complex PDEs in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The authors decompose generalization error into approximation and training error, prove neural networks can approximate PDE solutions as neurons increase, and analyze the gradient flow behavior in the 'wide network limit' over time.

Result: It is shown that under suitable assumptions, generalization error in DGFMs converges to zero as the number of neurons and training time approach infinity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DGFMs are mathematically viable for solving high-dimensional PDEs, achieving diminishing errors with increased computational resources.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.

*Oluwatosin Akande,Gabriel P. Langlois,Akwum Onwunta*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper develops novel deep learning architectures for inverse problems using the connection between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving inverse problems often struggle with ill-posedness and require effective use of prior information. There is a need for innovative approaches to improve regularization using relationships between proximal operators and modern mathematical tools.

Method: The study utilizes the connection between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations to design deep learning architectures that directly learn priors without requiring inversion after training.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates high efficiency and effectiveness in solving inverse problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: Leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi PDE connections with proximal operators offers a promising approach for learning priors in inverse problems, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application.

Abstract: Inverse problems are important mathematical problems that seek to recover model parameters from noisy data. Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LeanCat, a new benchmark for category-theoretic formalization in Lean, focusing on abstraction and library-mediated reasoning in modern mathematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate abstraction and library-mediated reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in formal theorem proving, which are underrepresented in current benchmarks.

Method: Developed LeanCat with 100 formalized statement-level tasks categorized into topic families and difficulty tiers, evaluated models' performance, and proposed LeanBridge using LeanExplore to enhance Mathlib searches.

Result: The best model achieved 8.25% pass at 1 and 12.00% at pass at 4. LeanBridge showed consistent improvements compared to single-model baselines.

Conclusion: LeanCat and LeanBridge offer a compact benchmark and a tool to assess and advance AI and human performance in mathematical formalization using Lean.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in formal theorem proving, yet current benchmarks under-measure the kind of abstraction and library-mediated reasoning that organizes modern mathematics. In parallel with FATE's emphasis on frontier algebra, we introduce LeanCat, a Lean benchmark for category-theoretic formalization -- a unifying language for mathematical structure and a core layer of modern proof engineering -- serving as a stress test of structural, interface-level reasoning. Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%). We also evaluate LeanBridge which use LeanExplore to search Mathlib, and observe consistent gains over single-model baselines. LeanCat is intended as a compact, reusable checkpoint for tracking both AI and human progress toward reliable, research-level formalization in Lean.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-sort weighted modal logic for possibilistic reasoning in fuzzy formal contexts, provides its formal axiomatization, demonstrates its expressive power through examples, generalizes concepts in formal concept analysis, and discusses extensions for multi-relational fuzzy contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities in fuzzy formal contexts, particularly by introducing new modal operators for necessity and sufficiency in modal logic.

Method: Proposes and axiomatizes a two-sort weighted modal logic framework, ensuring soundness and completeness with respect to fuzzy context models. Illustrative examples and generalization of FCA concepts are discussed.

Result: The weighted modal logic framework successfully incorporates necessity and sufficiency modalities, generalizes key formal concept analysis notions, and shows flexibility for reasoning in multi-relational fuzzy contexts.

Conclusion: The logic provides an expressive and formal reasoning tool for fuzzy contexts, with potential extensions for handling more complex fuzzy relations.

Abstract: We introduce a two-sort weighted modal logic for possibilistic reasoning with fuzzy formal contexts. The syntax of the logic includes two types of weighted modal operators corresponding to classical necessity ($\Box$) and sufficiency ($\boxminus$) modalities and its formulas are interpreted in fuzzy formal contexts based on possibility theory. We present its axiomatization that is \emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of extending our logic to reasoning with multi-relational fuzzy contexts, in which the Boolean combinations of different fuzzy relations are allowed.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning methods like PINNs, DeepONet, and GNS against traditional solvers for geotechnical problems, highlighting their inefficiencies and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The objective is to assess whether deep learning techniques can outperform or complement traditional solvers in solving geotechnical mechanics problems.

Method: Benchmarking was conducted between modern deep learning methods and traditional solvers by testing on wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction problems.

Result: Deep learning methods were slower, less accurate, and prone to catastrophic failures outside training data. Traditional solvers showed superior performance for accuracy, time efficiency, and scaling.

Conclusion: Rely on traditional solvers or automatic differentiation for inverse problems and apply neural networks only when computational expense of traditional methods justifies it, ensuring predictions stay within the training data range.

Abstract: Deep learning methods -- physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep operator networks (DeepONet), and graph network simulators (GNS) -- are increasingly proposed for geotechnical problems. This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) to network quantum processing units, achieving efficient teleportation in quantum computing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to scale quantum computing beyond single devices by networking multiple quantum processing units into a coherent quantum-HPC system, addressing scalability challenges.

Method: The proposed approach uses a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect system paired with a real-time quantum network orchestrator. It centralizes resources like entanglement sources and shared quantum memory while employing adaptive resource orchestration. Performance is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show that ModEn-Hub-style orchestration achieves around 90% teleportation success across 1-128 QPUs, outperforming the baseline which degrades to about 30%. This comes at the cost of more attempts (roughly 10-12 attempts compared to 3).

Conclusion: The ModEn-Hub architecture demonstrates its capability in achieving scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operations, providing robust performance improvements for near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computing beyond a single device requires networking many quantum processing units (QPUs) into a coherent quantum-HPC system. We propose the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture: a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect paired with a real-time quantum network orchestrator. ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.

*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,Adib Bazgir,Yuwen Zhang,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical framework with learned error mitigation to solve the viscous Burgers equation on noisy quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to utilize noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to solve complex fluid dynamics problems like the viscous Burgers equation, addressing challenges posed by noise and computational errors.

Method: The study employs the Cole-Hopf transformation to map the nonlinear equation to a diffusion form and uses a hybrid framework involving quantum simulations (Trotterized circuits) and attention-based graph neural networks for learned error mitigation.

Result: Quantum simulations on IBM hardware and simulators, coupled with zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), were benchmarked against classical solutions. The learned model significantly improved error correction beyond conventional ZNE methods.

Conclusion: Learned error mitigation, combined with physics-based approaches, demonstrates a promising pathway to efficient and accurate quantum simulations of partial differential equations on NISQ devices.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Quantum Inference Model (Q-VWSD) for Visual Word Sense Disambiguation, leveraging quantum concepts to handle semantic biases and outperform classical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current disambiguation methods struggle with semantic biases from different gloss sources, leading to unreliable results.

Method: Q-VWSD encodes glosses into a superposition state using quantum models, which reduces semantic bias and enhances inference. A heuristic version is proposed for efficiency on classical computers.

Result: The proposed Q-VWSD method surpasses state-of-the-art classical methods, especially with non-specialized glosses from large language models.

Conclusion: Q-VWSD demonstrates the efficacy of quantum-inspired approaches in practical tasks, offering a bridge between classical and quantum computing advancements.

Abstract: Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.

Conclusion: The TCI framework successfully addresses portability challenges in TN applications, and its open-source implementation proves its practicality and compatibility with existing systems.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are a central computational tool in quantum science and artificial intelligence. However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.

Result: q-iPrune significantly reduces gates in QNNs while maintaining controlled performance degradation, with theoretical guarantees for pruning effectiveness, error bounds, and computational feasibility.

Conclusion: q-iPrune enables efficient deployment of QNNs on NISQ devices by reducing redundancy, ensuring functionality, and adapting to hardware imperfections.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.
  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.
  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.
  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees.

*Jui-Ting Lu,Henrique Ennes,Chih-Kang Huang,Ali Abbassi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces new computational art tools, Quantum Brushes, leveraging quantum algorithms for creative applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal was to expand the application of quantum computing in innovative and creative areas such as computational arts.

Method: The study proposes two types of quantum brushes: Steerable and Chemical. Steerable employs quantum geometric control theory for blending artworks, while Chemical uses variational quantum algorithms to simulate molecular energy dynamics for canvas color evolution.

Result: Both types of quantum brushes were successfully implemented and made accessible as open-source tools compatible with existing frameworks.

Conclusion: Quantum brushes demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in creative domains, providing innovative tools for artists and expanding the reach of technology in the arts.

Abstract: Quantum brushes are computational arts software introduced by Ferreira et al (2025) that leverage quantum behavior to generate novel artistic effects. In this outreach paper, we introduce the mathematical framework and describe the implementation of two quantum brushes based on variational quantum algorithms, Steerable and Chemical. While Steerable uses quantum geometric control theory to merge two works of art, Chemical mimics variational eigensolvers for estimating molecular ground energies to evolve colors on an underlying canvas. The implementation of both brushes is available open-source at https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush and is fully compatible with the original quantum brushes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper combines sparse Boltzmann machines with probabilistic computing hardware to address the challenge of scaling neural quantum states to large system sizes. It demonstrates efficient sampling using FPGAs and a new dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, achieving scalable variational simulations of many-body quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to overcome the Monte Carlo sampling bottleneck that limits the scalability of neural quantum states for simulating large many-body quantum systems.

Method: The authors use sparse Boltzmann machine architectures combined with probabilistic hardware (field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs) for efficient sampling. They also introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines by conditionally sampling auxiliary layers to replace intractable marginalization.

Result: The proposed approach achieves accurate ground-state energies for a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with systems up to 80 × 80 spins (6400 spins). Additionally, they successfully train deep Boltzmann machines on systems with 35 × 35 spins (1225 spins), enabling scalable training of deep models.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that probabilistic hardware and novel training algorithms enable efficient sampling and scalable variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, paving the way for handling larger quantum systems and exploring deeper architectures.

Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.

*Sabrina Herbst,Ivona Brandić,Adrián Pérez-Salinas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the balance between quantum generative models' trainability and their ability to show quantum advantage, focusing on output distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities of quantum computers in generative modeling, particularly when dealing with distributions that classical methods struggle to simulate.

Method: Analyzed output distributions of quantum generative models, examining trainability versus anticoncentration and considering sparse distributions for better training.

Result: Found that anticoncentrated models are untrainable, while sparse distribution models are trainable, enabling classical surrogate sampling approaches.

Conclusion: Quantum advantage in generative models is achievable, but it must arise from mechanisms other than anticoncentration.

Abstract: Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.

### [458] [Security Without Detection: Economic Denial as a Primitive for Edge and IoT Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23849)
*Samaresh Kumar Singh,Joyjit Roy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel detection-independent security framework, Economic Denial Security (EDS), to mitigate cyberattacks by economically burdening attackers through cost amplification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of detection-based security mechanisms in IoT/edge environments, especially against sophisticated attackers using encryption and stealth techniques.

Method: The proposed EDS framework employs four mechanisms—adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation. It is formalized as a Stackelberg game with derivable equilibria for optimal parameter settings and provides a cost-effective solution for resource-constrained devices.

Result: Evaluation showed cost asymmetry favoring defenders, attack slowdowns, reduction in attack success, and low latency overhead. EDS achieved 94% malware mitigation when combined with ML-IDS and 88% standalone mitigation for IoT malware samples.

Conclusion: EDS shifts the economic balance in favor of defenders, offering a resource-efficient security solution for IoT/edge systems. It enhances protection even without traditional intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: Detection-based security fails against sophisticated attackers using encryption, stealth, and low-rate techniques, particularly in IoT/edge environments where resource constraints preclude ML-based intrusion detection. We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a system combining OCR, NLP, and verifiable credentials with blockchain to automate and secure real estate document processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The real estate industry relies heavily on manual document processing, leading to inefficiency and vulnerability to fraud.

Method: The system integrates OCR and NLP for document extraction, applies a VC-based standardization, automates data inconsistency checks, and utilizes blockchain for trust and transparency.

Result: The prototype achieved high accuracy across different document types and reduced verification time while maintaining reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework can optimize real estate transactions, enhance trust among stakeholders, and enable secure, scalable digital processes.

Abstract: The real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to streamline real estate transactions, strengthen stakeholder trust, and enable scalable, secure digital processes.

### [460] [SourceBroken: A large-scale analysis on the (un)reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24400)
*Biagio Montaruli,Serena Elisa Ponta,Luca Compagna,Davide Balzarotti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of SourceRank, a scoring system for open-source packages, against evasion attacks and finds it insufficiently robust for distinguishing between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of analysis on how well SourceRank can resist evasion attacks aimed at inflating the scores of malicious packages, potentially making them appear trustworthy.

Method: The authors propose a threat model to identify potential evasion approaches for SourceRank metrics. They evaluate SourceRank's reliability using data from both the PyPI ecosystem and the MalwareBench dataset.

Result: The analysis shows significant overlap in SourceRank scores between benign and malicious packages in real-world datasets. Additionally, URL confusion is identified as a growing attack vector, with an increase in prevalence from 4.2% to 7.0%.

Conclusion: SourceRank is not reliable for discriminating between benign and malicious packages in real-world settings, partly due to its failure to promptly reflect package removals. Evasion techniques, such as URL confusion, pose significant challenges to its robustness.

Abstract: SourceRank is a scoring system made of 18 metrics that assess the popularity and quality of open-source packages. Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.
  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.
  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies how blockchain-native RegTech addresses anti-money laundering challenges in decentralized systems, presenting three taxonomies and analyzing industry-academic discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance solutions are insufficient for decentralized and pseudonymous Web3 networks, creating a need for adapted RegTech methods.

Method: The paper develops taxonomies and evaluates compliance approaches through analysis of 41 commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes over a decade.

Result: Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification. Challenges remain in cross-chain tracking, DeFi analysis, and scalability.

Conclusion: Architectural best practices and future directions are needed to overcome challenges while adhering to decentralization principles of Web3 systems.

Abstract: The decentralized architecture of Web3 technologies creates fundamental challenges for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism compliance. Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities.
  We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems.
  Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty.

*Ken Huang,Jerry Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework focusing on secure and auditable self-improvement of AI agents through a growing skill graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-improving AI agents pose unresolved security and governance issues, such as reward hacking and behavioral drift, necessitating more transparent and verifiable improvement mechanisms.

Method: ASG-SI frames agent self-improvement as iterative skill compilation, incorporating verifier-backed checks, reward reconstruction, audit logging, and continual stress testing with memory control.

Result: The authors provide a complete system architecture, security analysis, and runnable reference implementation that showcases measurable improvement, secure reward construction, and auditable processes.

Conclusion: ASG-SI enables reproducible evaluation and secure operational governance by treating agentic self-improvement as the accumulation of reusable, verifiable capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is increasingly used to transform large language models into agentic systems that act over long horizons, invoke tools, and manage memory under partial observability. While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.
  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.
  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams. ASG-SI reframes agentic self-improvement as accumulation of verifiable, reusable capabilities, offering a practical path toward reproducible evaluation and operational governance of self-improving AI agents.

### [463] [Prompt-Induced Over-Generation as Denial-of-Service: A Black-Box Attack-Side Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23779)
*Manu,Yi Guo,Jo Plested,Tim Lynar,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Nirhoshan Sivaroopan,Jack Yang,Wangli Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of over-generation by large language models (LLMs) and introduces new black-box attack benchmarks using two prompt-based attackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of over-generation in LLMs, which negatively impacts performance, latency, cost, and creates vulnerability to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Method: The authors propose two black-box, query-only prompt attackers: EOGen (Evolutionary Over-Generation Search), which uses token search for suppressing EOS, and RL-GOAL, a reinforcement learning method to induce long continuations based on target lengths.

Result: EOGen achieves a mean Over-Generation Factor (OGF) of 1.38 +/- 1.15 with a Success@OGF >= 2 at 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL outperforms EOGen, achieving higher OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38) across victim LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a benchmarking framework for evaluating prompt-based over-generation attacks and showcases the effectiveness of evolutionary and reinforcement learning-based methods in inducing over-generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF >= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL is stronger: across victims it achieves higher mean OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38).

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study evaluates the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on LLM deployment pipelines, including safety filters, finding that existing filters can detect most such attacks but need further refinement for improved balance and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the oversight in prior jailbreak evaluations that focused only on the models, neglecting deployment pipelines with incorporated safety mechanisms.

Method: Conducted systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks on the entire inference pipeline, including input and output safety filters.

Result: Nearly all jailbreak techniques are detected by at least one safety filter, but there is room for improvement to balance recall and precision in detection systems.

Conclusion: Safety filters are effective but require further refinement for better detection accuracy and overall user experience; the study advocates for advanced optimization of LLM safety systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed, ensuring their safe use is paramount. Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience. We highlight critical gaps and call for further refinement of detection accuracy and usability in LLM safety systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a method designed to counteract covert communication via diffusion-based generative steganography, neutralizing hidden payloads with minimal perceptual distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI and diffusion-based steganography has enabled the creation of covert communications, posing security risks such as stegomalware delivery and data exfiltration that evade traditional detection methods.

Method: The authors introduce ADS, a training-free defense leveraging a pretrained denoiser and a quaternion-coupled update rule to minimize artifacts without compromising perceptual quality, neutralizing hidden payloads effectively.

Result: ADS was tested against Pulsar, a state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method, and successfully decreased decoder success rates to nearly zero while maintaining minimal impact on image quality.

Conclusion: ADS offers a robust defense mechanism against diffusion-based steganography, achieving an effective balance between security and utility without requiring extensive training or causing significant distortions.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of generative AI has normalized large-scale synthetic media creation, enabling new forms of covert communication. Recent generative steganography methods, particularly those based on diffusion models, can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders, creating significant challenges for detection and remediation. Coverless diffusion-based techniques are difficult to counter because they generate image carriers directly from secret data, enabling attackers to deliver stegomalware for command-and-control, payload staging, and data exfiltration while bypassing detectors that rely on cover-stego discrepancies. This work introduces Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a training-free defense for security gateways that neutralizes hidden payloads rather than detecting them. ADS employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders and incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits. Under a practical threat model and in evaluation against the state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method Pulsar, ADS drives decoder success rates to near zero with minimal perceptual impact. Results demonstrate that ADS provides a favorable security-utility trade-off compared to standard content transformations, offering an effective mitigation strategy against diffusion-driven steganography.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models, where adversarial prompts can cause severe computation bottlenecks during inference, significantly increasing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address a critical vulnerability in Mixture-of-Experts architectures, where adversarial inputs can exploit routing behavior to degrade system efficiency and service levels.

Method: The authors propose a black-box attack strategy called 'RepetitionCurse,' which identifies a flaw in MoE router behavior and creates adversarial prompts using repetitive token patterns to manipulate the routing system.

Result: Using RepetitionCurse on MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B leads to a 3.063x increase in end-to-end inference latency, causing major disruptions to service availability.

Conclusion: The study shows that routing vulnerabilities in MoE models can lead to significant performance bottlenecks when exploited by adversarial inputs, emphasizing the need to rethink system designs for better robustness.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts architectures have become the standard for scaling large language models due to their superior parameter efficiency. To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner. On widely deployed MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B, our method increases end-to-end inference latency by 3.063x, degrading service availability significantly.

TL;DR: SynRAG is a unified framework designed to create platform-specific threat detection and investigation queries for various SIEM platforms, solving the interoperability challenges analysts face with diverse systems by reducing manual work and training needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to simplify and unify threat detection and incident investigation across multiple, diverse SIEM platforms, as existing variations in query languages make it difficult for analysts to work seamlessly without extra training or workforce expansion.

Method: The paper introduces SynRAG, a framework that automatically translates a high-level platform-agnostic specification into platform-specific queries across SIEM platforms. Evaluations against state-of-the-art language models were conducted.

Result: SynRAG demonstrated superior performance in generating effective cross-SIEM queries when compared to existing language models such as GPT, Llama, and others, using Qradar and SecOps as test cases.

Conclusion: SynRAG effectively reduces manual work, training needs, and operational complexity for analysts monitoring diverse SIEM environments, enabling more efficient threat detection and incident investigation.

Abstract: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.

### [472] [The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24968)
*Hangcheng Zhao,Ron Berman*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on news publishers, observing traffic decline, effects of blocking bots, unchanged hiring trends, and shifts in content strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the implications of LLMs on news publishers and their strategic responses to changes in consumer behavior, web traffic, content creation, and employment.

Method: Analyzed granular, high-frequency data post-August 2024 using methods such as difference-in-differences analysis to examine traffic effects, hiring trends, and changes in content production strategies.

Result: Blocking LLM bots leads to reduced traffic (-23% total, -14% real consumer). No evidence of editorial job replacement was found. Publishers increased rich content rather than text volume and adopted more advertising technologies.

Conclusion: LLMs create unforeseen impacts on news consumption and production, with declines in publisher traffic, unchanged employment trends, and altered content strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.

### [473] [Muscle Synergy Patterns During Running: Coordinative Mechanisms From a Neuromechanical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24654)
*Ye Ma,Shixin Lin,Shengxing Fu,Yuwei Liu,Chenyi Guo,Dongwei Liu,Meijin Hou*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper reviews muscle synergies during running, emphasizing neural control theories, decomposition methods, and task modulation. It highlights stability in synergy structures but notes plasticity in spatial weightings, calling for standardized methodologies and translational research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore muscle synergies in running for better understanding neuromuscular coordination and control, and to address the variability in existing methods and applications for sports and medical purposes.

Method: The authors review surface electromyography (sEMG)-based muscle synergy analysis techniques, including computational methods like PCA, ICA, FA, NMF, and autoencoder-based approaches, and examine modulation factors influencing synergies.

Result: Findings reveal stability in core synergy structures during running, with high plasticity in spatial muscle weightings influenced by factors like task demands, fatigue, and pathology.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for standardized EMG protocols and greater integration of neuromusculoskeletal data to advance synergy analysis applications in biomechanics, training, and rehabilitation.

Abstract: Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion and a key task for evaluating neuromuscular control and lower-limb coordination. In recent years, muscle synergy analysis based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has become an important approach in this area. This review focuses on muscle synergies during running, outlining core neural control theories and biomechanical optimization hypotheses, summarizing commonly used decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF) and emerging autoencoder-based approaches. We synthesize findings on the development and evolution of running-related synergies across the lifespan, examine how running surface, speed, foot-strike pattern, fatigue, and performance level modulate synergy patterns, and describe characteristic alterations in populations with knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, and stroke. Current evidence suggests that the number and basic structure of lower-limb synergies during running are relatively stable, whereas spatial muscle weightings and motor primitives are highly plastic and sensitive to task demands, fatigue, and pathology. However, substantial methodological variability remains in EMG channel selection, preprocessing pipelines, and decomposition algorithms, and direct neurophysiological validation and translational application are still limited. Future work should prioritize standardized processing protocols, integration of multi-source neuromusculoskeletal data, nonlinear modeling, and longitudinal intervention studies to better exploit muscle synergy analysis in sports biomechanics, athletic training, and rehabilitation medicine.

### [474] [Kidney Exchange: Faster Parameterized Algorithms and Tighter Lower Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24037)
*Aritra Banik,Sujoy Bhore,Palash Dey,Abhishek Sahu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper focuses on computational advancements in the kidney exchange problem, presenting an improved deterministic Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) algorithm and new intractability results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational complexity in optimizing kidney exchange mechanisms, specifically by overcoming the NP-completeness of the problem through faster algorithms and parameterized complexity research.

Method: The authors proposed an improved deterministic algorithm with runtime $O^\star((4e)^t)$, significantly faster than previous approaches. They analyzed parameterized complexity by investigating the treewidth and pathwidth of associated graphs.

Result: The paper presents a faster deterministic FPT algorithm with a runtime of approximately $O^\star(10.88^t)$. It also establishes that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by pathwidth and provides other intractability insights.

Conclusion: The research contributes to improving computational methods for kidney exchange problems and understanding their parameterized intractability. It highlights both advancements and limits in algorithmic approaches.

Abstract: The kidney exchange mechanism allows many patient-donor pairs who are otherwise incompatible with each other to come together and exchange kidneys along a cycle. However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.
  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\star\left(14^t\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\star\left((4e)^t\right)\approx O^\star\left(10.88^t\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We also present some parameterized intractability results improving the current understanding of the problem under the framework of parameterized complexity.
