### [1] [ExaCraft: Dynamic Learning Context Adaptation for Personalized Educational Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09931)
*Akaash Chatterjee,Suman Kundu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExaCraft is an AI system that generates personalized educational examples, adapting dynamically to learners' behaviors and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing educational AI tools that fail to create or adapt examples to learners' evolving understanding, struggles, or skills.

Method: The system uses Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API integrated via a Chrome extension. It factors in user profiles (like location, education, and preferences) and real-time learner behavior to generate relevant examples.

Result: ExaCraft adapts examples dynamically through five learning context aspects: struggle indicators, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression data.

Conclusion: ExaCraft demonstrates an innovative approach to personalizing learning, evolving educational examples from basic to advanced based on real-time learner interaction and needs.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

### [2] [An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10208)
*Mehmet Emin Aydin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses efficiency challenges in optimization processes by proposing a generalised multi-objective reinforcement learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies in optimization by investigating a pool of operators and leveraging generalized experiences, especially for multi-objective cases.

Method: The methodology revolves around a generalised multi-objective reinforcement learning approach with certain completed stages and outstanding phases.

Result: The approach promises to enhance the efficiency of optimization algorithms through demonstration of multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The paper proposes this generalized approach as a promising remedy for improving performance in optimization and search processes.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

### [3] [Suzume-chan: Your Personal Navigator as an Embodied Information Hub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09932)
*Maya Grace Torii,Takahito Murakami,Shuka Koseki,Yoichi Ochiai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops an AI-based "Embodied Information Hub" to enhance human-like communication for knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of connection in digital tools used for information sharing and create more meaningful and human-centered knowledge exchanges.

Method: Using Social Presence Theory, the authors developed a prototype AI agent named Suzume-chan, incorporating a local language model and RAG system for learning and conversational interaction.

Result: The AI prototype enables interactive dialogue that reduces psychological distance, fostering warmer and more human-centered communication.

Conclusion: Suzume-chan demonstrates that AI agents can make information sharing not only efficient but also emotionally engaging and human-like through embodied interaction.

Abstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of "being together" enhances communication. An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.

### [4] [Exploring Health Misinformation Detection with Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09935)
*Chih-Han Chen,Chen-Han Tsai,Yu-Shao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage framework for detecting health misinformation by using language models for evidence evaluation and structured debate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the proliferation of health-related misinformation online, there is an urgent need for effective methods to verify claims using quality evidence and reasoning.

Method: The proposed method has two stages: first, language models predict an agreement score based on retrieved articles; second, disagreement triggers a structured debate among agents to synthesize evidence and provide verdicts.

Result: Experiments show that the framework outperforms baseline methods in health misinformation detection.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

### [5] [Phythesis: Physics-Guided Evolutionary Scene Synthesis for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10611)
*Minghao LI,Ruihang Wang,Rui Tan,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phythesis combines large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to create efficient data center layouts with improved energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency in traditional data center design, which struggles with scaling and complexity, by leveraging new AI-driven methodologies for energy-efficient layouts.

Method: Phythesis employs a bi-level optimization framework: a LLM-driven level for generating and refining 3D layouts, and a physics-informed level to optimize parameters and asset combinations.

Result: Phythesis provides a 57.3% increase in generation success rate and an 11.5% improvement in power usage effectiveness (PUE) compared to traditional LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: Phythesis demonstrates significant advancements in automating energy-efficient data center design, blending AI-driven layout synthesis with physics-guided fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

### [6] [Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09944)
*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Echo-CoPilot, a multi-task agent combining specialized echocardiography tools using a large language model to provide clinically coherent interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of manually interpreting echocardiographic studies that involve cognitively demanding, multi-view tasks, while existing models are limited to isolated subtasks without unified clinical assessments.

Method: Echo-CoPilot integrates a large language model for orchestrating specialized tools for echocardiography tasks such as view recognition, segmentation, measurements, disease prediction, and generating guideline-aware answers in a ReAct-style loop.

Result: Echo-CoPilot achieves a 50.8% accuracy on the MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming other models, and proves effective in resolving complex clinical cases by utilizing quantitative measurements.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot demonstrates the potential of multi-task agents in echocardiography, enhancing clinical decision-making through unified and comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

*Sha Li,Ayush Sadekar,Nathan Self,Yiqi Su,Lars Andersland,Mira Chaplin,Annabel Zhang,Hyoju Yang,James B Henderson,Krista Wigginton,Linsey Marr,T. M. Murali,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciEx, a modular framework for flexible scientific information extraction using large language models, addressing challenges like long-context documents and multi-modal content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve scientific information extraction from literature, which is challenging due to document length, variable content types, and inconsistent data across publications.

Method: SciEx framework is proposed with modular components for parsing, retrieval, extraction, and data aggregation, featuring adaptability to various schemas and new technologies.

Result: SciEx was tested on datasets covering three scientific topics and showed improved accuracy and consistency in fine-grained data extraction.

Conclusion: SciEx provides a composable and extensible solution for scientific data extraction, but highlights both the capabilities and limitations of current LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

### [9] [DynaMate: An Autonomous Agent for Protein-Ligand Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10034)
*Salomé Guilbert,Cassandra Masschelein,Jeremy Goumaz,Bohdan Naida,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DynaMate, an autonomous framework for simplifying molecular dynamics workflows using advanced AI features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of setting up molecular dynamics simulations, which involves technical processes like parameterization and software configuration, inhibits its broader application, particularly in biomolecular studies.

Method: DynaMate is a modular framework utilizing multi-agent systems and tools such as web search and self-correcting mechanisms, divided into three specialized modules for planning, simulation, and analysis of MD workflows.

Result: DynaMate successfully performed MD simulations and corrected runtime errors autonomously across 12 benchmark systems of varying complexity, delivering accurate protein-ligand interaction analyses.

Conclusion: DynaMate's automation capabilities promise to make molecular modeling standardized, scalable, and efficient, facilitating its use in biomolecular and drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

### [10] [SimWorld-Robotics: Synthesizing Photorealistic and Dynamic Urban Environments for Multimodal Robot Navigation and Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10046)
*Yan Zhuang,Jiawei Ren,Xiaokang Ye,Jianzhi Shen,Ruixuan Zhang,Tianai Yue,Muhammad Faayez,Xuhong He,Ziqiao Ma,Lianhui Qin,Zhiting Hu,Tianmin Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimWorld-Robotics (SWR), a simulation platform built on Unreal Engine 5 for testing robotics in realistic, large-scale urban environments. Two benchmarks evaluate advanced robotic capabilities, and results show current models face challenges in these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited focus of current robotics simulation platforms and benchmarks on indoor scenarios and provide a tool that tests diverse robot capabilities in urban environments.

Method: Developed SimWorld-Robotics, a high-fidelity simulation platform generating scalable urban settings including dynamic pedestrians and traffic. Created two benchmarks: one for vision-language instruction-following and another for multi-agent robot collaboration.

Result: Experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art models revealed significant struggles in executing tasks, highlighting gaps in perception, reasoning, and planning for urban environments.

Conclusion: SWR and its benchmarks represent an advancement for studying generalist robotics, emphasizing critical areas for improvement in urban robotics and robot collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

### [11] [Parallel Decoder Transformer: Model-Internal Parallel Decoding with Speculative Invariance via Note Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10054)
*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT) to enable parallel generation in large language models without retraining, overcoming latency issues and coherence drift associated with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce latency bottlenecks caused by sequential autoregressive decoding in large language models and to address coherence drift in parallel generation methods.

Method: PDT integrates Speculative Note Conditioning adapters into a frozen pre-trained model, allowing synchronization among parallel decoding streams using a global latent space and a verification mechanism.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and maintains approximate serial semantics without modifying trunk weights, proving its efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: PDT offers an effective, parameter-efficient, and scalable approach to parallel text generation, overcoming limitations of sequential decoding and existing parallelization methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

### [12] [Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058)
*Dani Roytburg,Beck Miller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI safety and ethics research are largely separate, with limited collaboration, focusing on distinct aspects of alignment. Bridging the divide conceptually and institutionally is crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need to produce aligned AI systems amidst rapid AI developments, yet alignment research remains split into largely isolated tracks of AI safety and AI ethics.

Method: A bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis was conducted using 6,442 papers from ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025) to study the structural divide between AI safety and ethics research.

Result: Over 80% of collaborations occur within either safety or ethics communities, with limited bridging links accounting for most interdisciplinary exchange. Removing key brokers exacerbates segregation.

Conclusion: The divide between AI safety and AI ethics is structural and conceptual. Integration across both fields via shared benchmarks, venues, and methodologies is necessary to develop robust and just AI systems.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

### [13] [Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10065)
*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) encode and use sociodemographic attributes based on indirect cues like names and occupations, revealing implicit biases and their effects on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms by which LLMs infer and encode sociodemographic attributes of users, and assess their implications for fairness and representation.

Method: The authors used probing techniques to analyze the residual streams in the layers of transformer-based LLMs, targeting demographic encoding based on direct input (explicit demographic disclosure) and indirect input (names and occupations).

Result: They found that LLMs develop geometric directions in activation space encoding demographics. Implicit biases from names and occupations align with real-world statistics and actively influence downstream tasks like career recommendations.

Conclusion: Even LLMs passing bias benchmarks can harbor implicit demographic biases that shape their behavior, highlighting fairness challenges when deployed broadly.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

*Nick Jiang,Xiaoqing Sun,Lisa Dunlap,Lewis Smith,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper proposes Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for interpretable and cost-effective text corpus analysis, with superior controlled embeddings compared to LLMs or dense embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent challenges of analyzing large-scale text corpora and limitations in current costly or uncontrolled techniques for identifying biases or behaviors in data.

Method: Employ sparse autoencoders to generate interpretable embeddings for large-scale text analysis, using data properties observable within the embedding dimensions.

Result: SAEs deliver more reliable, cost-effective, and controllable embeddings compared to baseline methods like LLMs, enabling tasks like semantic dataset comparison, concept-based clustering, and model behavior investigation.

Conclusion: SAEs are shown to be versatile and impactful tools for analyzing unstructured data, uncovering insights about model behavior and dataset biases efficiently while emphasizing interpretable representation of concepts in embeddings.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computational framework to analyze conspiratorial narratives in Singapore Telegram groups, showing their integration into everyday discussions rather than isolated echo chambers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the structure and distribution of conspiratorial content in digital communication systems, particularly in less-isolated, everyday interactions.

Method: They developed a two-stage framework: fine-tuning RoBERTa-large to classify conspiratorial content and constructing a signed belief graph analyzed using a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN).

Result: The analysis identified seven narrative archetypes in 553,648 messages, and the SiBeGNN demonstrated high clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) compared to baselines, with 88% expert evaluation agreement.

Conclusion: Conspiratorial discussions exist in routine social interactions and challenge assumptions about online radicalization. The framework also has applications for stance detection, political studies, and content moderation.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgriRegion, a retrieval-augmented generation framework to address contextual hallucination in agricultural advice by providing region-aware and locally accurate solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of contextual hallucination in general-purpose language models when providing agricultural advice, which can vary drastically due to regional differences in soil, climate, and regulations.

Method: AgriRegion employs a retrieval-augmented generation framework with geospatial metadata injection and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism while restricting the knowledge base to verified local sources.

Result: AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs and improves trust scores according to evaluations on the newly created AgriRegion-Eval dataset.

Conclusion: The AgriRegion framework demonstrates its effectiveness in providing region-aware agricultural guidance, addressing critical issues in general-purpose LLMs, and promoting more trustable and localized advisory systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

TL;DR: The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index reveals a decline in transparency among foundation model developers, with scores dropping significantly compared to 2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and quantify the transparency practices of foundation model developers as their impacts on society and governance grow.

Method: The study introduces new transparency indicators and evaluates various developers, including new entrants like Alibaba and xAI, by scoring them on their transparency practices.

Result: Transparency scores decreased, averaging 40 in 2025 compared to 58 in 2024. IBM scored the highest (95), while xAI and Midjourney scored the lowest (14). Frontier Model Forum companies showed moderate transparency.

Conclusion: Transparency among foundation model developers is declining overall, necessitating stricter policy interventions to address critical gaps.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CP-Env, a simulation environment to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks for LLMs in medical settings currently focus on static tests or isolated scenarios, which fail to capture the complexities of real-world clinical pathways.

Method: The paper presents CP-Env, a hospital simulation that involves multiple agents and scenarios across long, branching clinical tasks. It also proposes a three-tiered evaluation framework: Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics.

Result: Results show that many models struggle with the complexity of pathways, engaging in hallucinations or missing critical diagnostic steps. Excessive reasoning can be counterproductive, and top-performing models rely less on external tools, leveraging internal knowledge instead.

Conclusion: CP-Env provides a significant advance for testing and improving medical AI agents in realistic, complex clinical workflows, paving the way for further development in this domain.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in current Predict-and-Search frameworks, which are restricted to binary problems and fail to account for diverse, fixed variables frequently found in real-world optimization tasks.

Method: The authors propose ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework integrated with machine learning models to better handle heterogeneous variables in parametric MIPs.

Result: Experimental results show ID-PaS outperforms both Gurobi and the original PaS framework across various large-scale, real-world problems.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of extending machine learning-driven optimization frameworks to handle parametric MIPs, offering superior results in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reverse thinking framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their ability to detect missing information, achieving significant accuracy improvements over forward reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often fail to address tasks requiring identification of missing information, leading to issues like incomplete responses and factual inaccuracies.

Method: The authors propose a reverse thinking framework that employs backward reasoning to help LLMs systematically detect missing elements in reasoning tasks.

Result: The reverse thinking approach significantly outperforms traditional forward reasoning methods in detecting missing information.

Conclusion: Reverse thinking offers a promising direction to improve LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness, addressing common challenges in missing information tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

*Waleed Razzaq,Izis Kankaraway,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a biologically-inspired continuous-time attention mechanism called Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), offering efficient adaptive dynamics and improved accuracy across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention mechanisms improve representation learning but struggle with continuous-time modeling due to their discrete nature.

Method: NAC introduces a biologically plausible mechanism using sparse sensory gates and nonlinear interlinked models, supported by sparse key-query concatenation schemes and various computation modes.

Result: NAC showed competitive or superior accuracy in experiments on irregular time-series classification, autonomous driving tasks, and industrial prognostics, with efficient memory intensity and moderate runtime.

Conclusion: NAC provides a promising continuous-time attention mechanism that bridges biology-inspired design with practical machine learning tasks, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to analyze how vision-language models (VLMs) function, focusing on attention heads in multimodal reasoning using a new dataset (CogVision) and probing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform well but their internal mechanisms, especially the roles of attention heads in reasoning, remain unclear. This study aims to interpret these mechanisms systematically.

Method: A novel dataset, CogVision, is introduced to simulate step-by-step reasoning with subquestions tied to cognitive tasks. Attention heads are probed and analyzed for their specialized roles, with further experiments to test their contribution to reasoning.

Result: Functional attention heads were found to be sparse across VLMs, show variability between tasks, and contribute to performance. Their removal degraded performance significantly, while emphasis improved accuracy.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of VLM cognitive structures and emphasizes the importance of functional attention heads for reasoning. It also provides insights for aligning models with human-like reasoning skills.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the widening gap between AI's technical capabilities and institutional accountability by incorporating systematic frameworks for trust and governance.

Method: The paper proposes the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, embedding human input, semantic coherence, and audit integrity into a Control-Panel architecture inspired by international standards and Australia's AI Assurance initiatives.

Result: The framework systematically integrates governance mechanisms into AI systems, ensuring trustworthiness and maintaining verifiability, transparency, and human control.

Conclusion: Trustworthiness and accountability in AI systems can be engineered through structured frameworks, ensuring their adherence to verifiable and transparent standards.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

TL;DR: This paper introduces InfoCom, a communication-efficient framework for collaborative perception in autonomous driving, achieving significant data reduction while maintaining near-lossless results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the communication-performance trade-off in collaborative perception systems, which are critical for autonomous driving but face network constraints due to large information-sharing demands.

Method: The paper proposes InfoCom, a framework leveraging Information Bottleneck principles to optimize communication by introducing Information-Aware Encoding, Sparse Mask Generation, and Multi-Scale Decoding techniques.

Result: InfoCom reduces communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale with near-lossless perception quality, showing 440-fold and 90-fold communication reductions compared to Where2comm and ERMVP.

Conclusion: InfoCom provides a significant advancement in communication-efficient collaborative perception, balancing reduced data transmission with high-quality perception, suitable for practical autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a user-feedback-driven framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), enhancing adaptation quality by integrating human interactions, overcoming current limitations of unsupervised adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve VLN agents by addressing the lack of user interaction in General Scene Adaptation frameworks, enabling better real-world deployment.

Method: The framework integrates user feedback (navigation instructions and corrections) as high-quality training data and employs a memory-bank warm-start for efficient adaptation while mitigating performance degradation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced navigation success and path efficiency compared to prior baselines, showcasing stable performance and improvements in diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully improves continual learning and adaptation for VLN while leveraging user feedback to address cold-start issues and promote stable redeployment in varied environments.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of Inference-time steering failure in pretrained models by introducing a solution for Marginal Path Collapse using a novel Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address Marginal Path Collapse, a key issue occurring when combining heterogeneous models during inference-time steering, common in tasks like molecular design.

Method: The authors introduce a solution called ACE, which extends Feynman-Kac steering to allow time-varying exponents, ensuring stability in target probability paths.

Result: ACE successfully eliminates Marginal Path Collapse, enabling stable compositional generation with improved metrics over existing methods.

Conclusion: This work transforms ratio-of-densities steering from an unstable method into a reliable tool, making compositional generation with heterogeneous models viable for new tasks without retraining.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

*Wenhan Wu,Zhili He,Huanghuang Liang,Yili Gong,Jiawei Jiang,Chuang Hu,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces REMISVFU, a framework for efficient unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), preserving the model's utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-protection regulations like GDPR mandate the right to be forgotten in federated systems, prompting the need for effective unlearning methods in VFL.

Method: REMISVFU involves representation misdirection where the forgetting client alters its encoder output to a random anchor, combined with server optimization of retention and forgetting losses using orthogonal projection.

Result: Experimental analysis indicates that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success rates and only minimally impacts clean accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: REMISVFU demonstrates effective client-level unlearning for VFL while maintaining utility for non-forgetting clients, offering a significant advance in federated unlearning approaches.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

*Ziying Zhang,Quanming Yao,Yaqing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmerFlow, an AI-based recommendation framework, addressing the challenge of recommending emerging items with limited interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve recommendations for emerging items, which are often challenging due to limited interaction data and a lack of consideration in existing models.

Method: EmerFlow enhances emerging items' raw features using LLM reasoning, aligns these with the embedding space of an existing model, and applies meta-learning for refinement.

Result: Experiments in domains like movies and pharmaceuticals demonstrate EmerFlow's superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EmerFlow effectively generates distinctive and expressive embeddings for emerging items by utilizing limited interaction data, outperforming alternative approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

Method: AgentProg organizes interaction history as a structured program with variables and control flow, incorporating a belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP to handle partial observability.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like AndroidWorld show that AgentProg outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art success rates and maintaining robust long-horizon performance.

Conclusion: AgentProg demonstrates a reliable solution to interaction history management, overcoming context overhead issues and enabling effective automation of long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

### [32] [V-OCBF: Learning Safety Filters from Offline Data via Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10822)
*Mumuksh Tayal,Manan Tayal,Aditya Singh,Shishir Kolathaya,Ravi Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), enabling the learning of safety-guaranteeing neural control barrier functions using offline demonstrations, without hand-engineering or requiring full system dynamics knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing methods which either rely on full dynamics knowledge or soft constraint enforcement, and to ensure safety in autonomous systems through model-free, offline learning.

Method: The V-OCBF framework learns a neural control barrier function using offline demonstrations, employs a recursive finite-difference update for propagating safety, and utilizes an expectile-based objective to restrict updates to dataset-supported actions.

Result: V-OCBF demonstrated fewer safety violations and strong task performance across various case studies compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively synthesizes safety-critical controllers offline, without relying on online interaction or expert-designed dynamics models, ensuring better safety and task scalability.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses urban regeneration challenges posed by rapid urbanization, focusing on adaptive and dynamic planning approaches.

Method: The proposed CUP framework leverages LLMs through three components: (1) Planning: generating and refining urban plans using relevant data, (2) Living: simulating resident behavior and environment interactions, and (3) Judging: evaluating plans and iterating improvements.

Result: Experiments utilizing real-world data showcase the framework’s ability to continuously adapt and improve urban management planning.

Conclusion: CUP is an effective tool for responsive urban planning, offering a continuous, closed-loop cycle of generation, simulation, and evaluation.

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

*Yang Yu,Zhuangzhuang Chen,Siqi Wang,Lanqing Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SaEI, a method to improve reasoning in vision-language models by intervening in entropy during reinforcement learning sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based methods often enhance reasoning capabilities of VLMs but lack entropy intervention during sampling, which can boost diversity and performance.

Method: SaEI introduces entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) and token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) for adversarial entropy intervention during RL sampling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvement in policy exploration and reasoning capabilities with SaEI on various datasets.

Conclusion: Introducing SaEI effectively boosts reasoning abilities in VLMs by implementing entropy intervention during RL sampling to explore a larger answer space.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL-based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing studies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ignore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the diversity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which enhances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the entropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial objective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger answer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the effectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

*Ezequiel Lopez-Rubio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reversible, compact string-based representation for graphs to enable their efficient processing by deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representations, such as adjacency matrices, are not well-suited for processing by deep learning language models.

Method: It converts graphs into strings representing adjacency matrices step-by-step via simple instructions, maintaining structural patterns and allowing reversible transformation.

Result: Initial computational experiments suggest the proposed method provides promising performance.

Conclusion: The novel representation could enhance graph processing by leveraging deep learning models effectively.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

*Hojun Lee,Mijin Koo,Yeji Song,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TAFAP, a method for Targeted Data Protection (TDP) in diffusion models that enables control over training trajectories, ensuring effective identity and visual pattern transformations with high image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement associated with fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models, as well as the limitations of existing protection methods to control training outcomes.

Method: It proposes TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), leveraging trajectory-matching and dataset distillation concepts to maintain persistent and verifiable transformations during the model's training.

Result: TAFAP achieves successful targeted transformations in diffusion models, offering control over identity and visual patterns while maintaining high-quality outputs, outperforming current TDP techniques.

Conclusion: TAFAP provides a robust framework for safeguarding against unauthorized data usage in diffusion models and offers verifiable and effective control over training alterations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Large Language Models (LLMs) used in scientific peer review can be manipulated through adversarial PDF strategies aimed at flipping 'Reject' decisions to 'Accept,' using a new metric called WAVS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in peer review, either by individual reviewers or formal institutions, creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited for unfair decision-making. This study aims to explore these weaknesses.

Method: The study evaluated domain-specific adversarial strategies to manipulate decisions on a dataset of 200 scientific papers using 13 popular LLMs. A novel metric, WAVS, was developed to measure vulnerabilities.

Result: Obfuscation techniques such as 'Maximum Mark Magyk' were highly effective, managing to flip decisions even in sophisticated LLMs like GPT-5.

Conclusion: LLMs used in peer review are susceptible to adversarial manipulation, highlighting the need for robust security measures and further research to safeguard scientific integrity.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot procedural content generation (PCG) parameter optimization using an Actor-Critic agent system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of controlling procedural content generation (PCG) pipelines, which require configuring technical parameters that often don't align directly with user-friendly instructions.

Method: The proposed method uses an Actor-Critic agent architecture, with the Actor handling tool parameters and the Critic iteratively refining configurations to align with human preferences. Off-the-shelf LLMs provide the foundation, eliminating the need for task-specific model fine-tuning.

Result: The authors validated the system on 3D map generation, showing that it outperforms single-agent baselines. It produced diverse, structurally valid environments from natural language inputs.

Conclusion: The system showcases the efficacy of off-the-shelf LLMs as generalized agents for PCG, enabling a scalable, training-free approach to mastering software tools beyond PCG applications.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: InternGeometry, a new LLM agent surpasses gold medalist scores in International Mathematical Olympiad geometry tasks using iterative propositions, symbolic engine feedback, dynamic memory, and reinforcement learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring and enhancing AI capabilities in solving challenging geometry problems, which are currently limited and dominated by expert models with heavy reliance on large-scale training data.

Method: InternGeometry iteratively combines propositions, auxiliary constructions, verification via symbolic engine, reflection on feedback, and utilizes a dynamic memory mechanism. Additionally, it employs Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning to raise task difficulty gradually.

Result: InternGeometry solves 44 out of 50 IMO geometry problems with minimal training data (13K examples), outperforming gold medalist scores and surpassing AlphaGeometry 2's reliance on large datasets.

Conclusion: LLM agents can achieve expert-level performance in geometry tasks with innovative methods, using significantly reduced training data, paving the way for efficient and robust AI systems in mathematical problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NormCode, a structured approach for constructing workflows with large language models (LLMs) that prevents context pollution and improves transparency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of context contamination in multistep workflows involving LLMs, which hinders accuracy, transparency, and effective task management.

Method: The authors propose NormCode, a semiformal language for structuring workflows into isolated, traceable steps classified into semantic (non-deterministic) and syntactic (deterministic) operations.

Result: NormCode was validated through demonstrations including a base-X addition algorithm with 100% accuracy and self-hosted execution of NormCode's compiler pipeline using a structured orchestrator.

Conclusion: NormCode provides an auditable framework for transparent, efficient AI workflows in critical applications such as legal, medical, and financial domains, addressing cross-step contamination challenges.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces scRCL, a framework leveraging cell-gene associations for accurate cell-type identification in single-cell studies, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clustering methods inadequately utilize cell-gene associations, limiting their ability to differentiate closely related cell types in single-cell omics studies.

Method: The proposed scRCL framework incorporates contrastive distribution alignment and a refinement module leveraging gene-correlation structures to enhance cell embeddings.

Result: scRCL achieves superior cell-type identification accuracy across benchmark datasets and reveals biologically coherent gene-expression signatures.

Conclusion: The scRCL framework refines representation learning through cell-gene associations, improving biological relevance and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

TL;DR: CAPTAIN is a training-free framework that addresses privacy concerns in diffusion models by directly modifying latent features during the denoising process, effectively reducing memorization while maintaining alignment with prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy and copyright issues caused by diffusion models unintentionally reproducing training examples, for which current mitigation methods are often ineffective.

Method: CAPTAIN reduces memorization in diffusion models by frequency-based noise initialization, identifying key timesteps for intervention, and injecting features from non-memorized images into localized latent regions.

Result: CAPTAIN significantly reduces memorization in diffusion models compared to classifier-free guidance-based methods, while maintaining alignment with input prompts and producing visually high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: CAPTAIN offers an effective, training-free solution for reducing the memorization of training data in diffusion models, ensuring both privacy and quality in system outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

TL;DR: The study investigates how value diversity among agents in AI communities impacts their collective behaviors. It finds that value diversity fosters stability, creativity, and emergent behaviors but notes diminishing returns with extreme heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the influence of value diversity on the collective behaviors and intelligence of AI communities, driven by increasing adoption of LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Method: Simulated multi-agent interactions were conducted with varying levels of value diversity, using Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values as a framework, examining their self-organizing principles during constitution formation.

Result: Value diversity enhances stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and enables creative principles, but extreme diversity leads to instability.

Conclusion: Value diversity contributes positively to AI communities but requires balance to avoid instability. This opens up avenues for future AI advancements linked to sociological insights.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

*Oscar Robben,Saeed Khalilian,Nirvana Meratnia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hardware-aware NAS technique to optimize early-exit networks, improving accuracy and efficiency by strategically optimizing positions, layers, and thresholds in exit branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing early-exit networks is challenging as it requires balancing efficiency and performance, especially for resource-constrained devices.

Method: The paper utilizes hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize the depth and types of layers in exit branches and adapts thresholds for computation efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework achieves higher accuracy while maintaining or reducing the average number of MACs compared to existing methods, validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets.

Conclusion: Hardware-aware optimization of early-exit networks through NAS leads to better-performing networks with reduced latency and energy consumption for diverse datasets.

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

*Zouying Cao,Jiaji Deng,Li Yu,Weikang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReMe, a dynamic framework for agent memory systems in large language models, aimed at improving reasoning by refining and efficiently managing procedural memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory frameworks treat memory as static archives, which hinders dynamic reasoning and limits the understanding of procedural knowledge.

Method: ReMe enhances memory systems through three mechanisms: multi-faceted distillation, context-adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement, ensuring refined and efficient management of experiences.

Result: ReMe achieved state-of-the-art performance in experiments, with a memory-scaling effect showing smaller models equipped with ReMe outperforming larger memoryless counterparts.

Conclusion: The framework enables computation-efficient lifelong learning via dynamic and self-evolving procedural memory systems, benefiting future research on agent evolution in LLMs.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

*Manon Kempermann,Sai Suresh Macharla Vasu,Mahalakshmi Raveenthiran,Theo Farrell,Ingmar Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an exploratory study on evaluating the safety of large language model (LLM) advice in finance and health domains, emphasizing the need for context-aware evaluations tailored to varied user vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions use LLMs for personal advice in high-stakes fields like health and finance, where risks are context-dependent. Current evaluations overlook the user's specific context, leaving vulnerable users inadequately protected.

Method: An exploratory study evaluating advice from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Safety evaluations compared responses given rich user context versus limited/disclosed user context. Diverse vulnerability profiles were included.

Result: Safety evaluations by context-aware evaluators rated LLM responses significantly less safe for high-vulnerability users. Adding disclosed user context through prompts showed no substantial improvements in safety ratings.

Conclusion: Evaluating user-welfare safety requires considering diverse user profiles and the evaluator's awareness of context. Existing universal-risk frameworks are inadequate for individual welfare assessments, especially for vulnerable populations. The study's methodology and resources provide a basis for future work.

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

### [47] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEAL-RAG, a controller designed to enhance multi-hop query generation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems without expanding the retrieval context window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems face issues with multi-hop queries due to missed bridge facts during the retrieval stage. Existing methods tend to expand context, leading to context dilution and less effective retrieval efficiency.

Method: SEAL-RAG combines a Search → Extract → Assess → Loop cycle to iteratively refine the retrieval context. It uses entity-anchored extraction, gap specification, targeted micro-queries, and entity-first ranking to improve evidence and reduce distractors under fixed retrieval depth.

Result: SEAL-RAG significantly outperforms existing systems like Self-RAG and Adaptive-$k$. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), it improves correctness by 3-13 pp and evidence precision by 12-18 pp. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by 8.0 pp in accuracy, maintaining high evidence precision.

Conclusion: The proposed SEAL-RAG is effective in addressing context dilution by replacing distractors with more relevant evidence, ensuring precision and controlled cost profiles. The approach is validated with statistically significant results, and the code is available for public use.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing Chest X-ray interpretation through reinforcement learning (RL) and reasoning methods in vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of Chest X-ray interpretation models since many rely only on supervised fine-tuning which may overlook task-specific feedback and answer quality.

Method: Combining large-scale supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, along with introducing intermediate reasoning capabilities to vision-language models.

Result: RL provides additional performance gains for Chest X-ray report generation and visual grounding tasks, while explicit reasoning shows no added improvement.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned reinforcement learning is an effective complement to supervised fine-tuning for medical vision-language models, achieving state-of-the-art results in Chest X-ray interpretation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

TL;DR: CA-GPT, a specialized AI model, outperformed ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in decision-making during OCT-guided PCI procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve operator-independent interpretation of OCT imaging during PCI procedures and overcome limitations of general-purpose AI models.

Method: A single-center analysis comparing the procedural decisions of CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians during OCT-guided PCI using ten metrics for agreement with expert-derived records.

Result: CA-GPT showed significantly higher agreement scores in both pre-PCI and post-PCI phases compared to ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: CA-GPT presents a reliable, standardized solution for OCT interpretation during PCI, offering significant potential to enhance operator expertise and procedural outcomes.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

*Wang Lu,Yao Zhu,Jindong Wang*

TL;DR: HAROOD introduces a comprehensive benchmark for sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how distributional shifts affect HAR models' performance, and identifying effective OOD algorithms for HAR.

Method: Defined 4 OOD scenarios for HAR and conducted experiments on 6 datasets with 16 methods using CNN and Transformer architectures.

Result: No single OOD algorithm consistently outperforms others for HAR, showing room for improvement. Presented key findings for research.

Conclusion: HAROOD provides a modular benchmark to advance research in OOD-based HAR and is available for public use at the provided repository.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Agile Deliberation,' a framework for iteratively refining visual concepts for vision classifiers, emphasizing subjective user input via concept scoping and iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop systems assume stable, clear concept understanding, but users often begin with vague notions that evolve through deliberation, necessitating better support.

Method: 'Agile Deliberation' uses concept scoping to create structured hierarchies and concept iteration to refine user intent with borderline examples, iteratively aligning classifiers to subjective concepts.

Result: Evaluation via 18 user sessions showed 7.5% higher F1 scores compared to automated baselines, 3% higher than manual approaches, with improved user understanding and reduced cognitive effort.

Conclusion: The framework effectively supports evolving and subjective visual concepts, outperforming automated and manual deliberation, providing clearer understanding and easing cognitive load.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

### [52] [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10895)
*Lijie Ding,Janell Thomson,Jon Taylor,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance proposal selection at large user facilities, showing that LLMs offer cost-effective, scalable, and consistent performance, rivaling human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues in human proposal reviewing, such as bias, inconsistency, and weak inter-proposal correlations, and to overcome the impractical workload of pairwise preference-based ranking methods for human reviewers.

Method: The paper utilizes LLMs to rank proposals using data from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source, analyzing their alignment with human reviews and assessing performance in identifying high-publication-potential proposals.

Result: LLMs provided rankings strongly correlated with expert human rankings and demonstrated similar performance in identifying high-impact proposals, all while being far more cost-effective. LLMs also enabled advanced, quantitative analyses like proposal similarity assessment.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as a scalable and effective supplement or alternative to human review, providing consistent and advanced ranking and analysis, while massively reducing costs and workloads.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

*Muhammad Umair Haider,Hammad Rizwan,Hassan Sajjad,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a node-level pruning framework for identifying minimal subnetworks in large language models that are responsible for specific behaviors, addressing scalability and granularity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing circuit discovery methods are computationally expensive and coarse-grained, failing to account for finer structures like individual neurons.

Method: A node-level pruning framework with learnable masks is used to guide multi-granularity sparsity penalties, enabling compressed circuit discovery in a single fine-tuning run.

Result: The proposed approach identifies smaller and more granular circuits compared to prior methods while maintaining task performance, and achieves a lower memory footprint by 5-10x.

Conclusion: The method improves circuit discovery efficiency, handling node-level granularity for better comprehension of LLM behaviors and reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a detailed correspondence between POMDP-based decision-making agents and one-input process functions from quantum operations, proposing a dual interpretation framework for AI and physics views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a unified framework to connect decision-making systems in AI with concepts from quantum operations, making multi-agent synthesis feasible in partially observable environments.

Method: By analyzing POMDP environments and agents' policies through process functions, the authors interpret these agents in terms of higher-order quantum frameworks like the link product.

Result: They establish a dual interpretation of process functions from both a physics and AI perspective, generalizing the framework to decentralized multi-agent systems using multi-input process functions.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between quantum operations and decision-making in AI, advancing the understanding of decentralized system operations and their representation in POMDP settings for multi-agent dynamics.

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.

*Jeongeun Kim,Sabrina Yarzada,Paul Chen,Christopher Torng*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable approach for chip tapeouts, optimizing the integration of multiple small hardware designs in shared dies by automating layout and optimizing shared resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-project wafer services struggle to scale with increasing project counts, creating a need for better solutions for research and training in the semiconductor workforce.

Method: The approach involves (1) automated algorithm-driven packing, (2) using narrow-area regions for interconnections and shared needs, and (3) enabling per-project power characterization with simplified on-chip power domains.

Result: Achieved area reductions up to 13x compared to traditional methods, demonstrating effectiveness in scalability and resource utilization.

Conclusion: The proposed method meets the demand for scalable, cost-efficient tapeout capabilities, simplifies design complexity, and supports large-scale hardware innovation.

Abstract: Growing interest in semiconductor workforce development has generated demand for platforms capable of supporting large numbers of independent hardware designs for research and training without imposing high per-project overhead. Traditional multi-project wafer (MPW) services based solely on physical co-placement have historically met this need, yet their scalability breaks down as project counts rise. Recent efforts towards scalable chip tapeouts mitigate these limitations by integrating many small designs within a shared die and attempt to amortize costly resources such as IO pads and memory macros. However, foundational principles for arranging, linking, and validating such densely integrated design sites have received limited systematic investigation. This work presents a new approach with three key techniques to address this gap. First, we establish a structured formulation of the design space that enables automated, algorithm-driven packing of many projects, replacing manual layout practices. Second, we introduce an architecture that exploits only the narrow-area regions between sites to deliver on off-chip communication and other shared needs. Third, we provide a practical approach for on-chip power domains enabling per-project power characterization at a standard laboratory bench and requiring no expertise in low-power ASIC design. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantial area reductions of up to 13x over state-of-the-art physical-only aggregation methods, offering a scalable and cost-effective path forward for large-scale tapeout environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between software developers and custom hardware design by simplifying chip creation and maintaining continuity between software and hardware.

Method: A one-to-one mapping of software objects to chip regions is proposed, using modular IP blocks and type systems to ensure hardware efficiency. Hardware interconnect strategies and layout techniques align with object-oriented design.

Result: Demonstrates a practical and educational chip design flow aligned with software structures, making hardware design accessible for introductory learners.

Conclusion: The approach reduces the expertise needed for software developers to create custom chips, enabling broader participation in chip design.

Abstract: Developers who primarily engage with software often struggle to incorporate custom hardware into their applications, even though specialized silicon can provide substantial benefits to machine learning and AI, as well as to the application domains that they enable. This work investigates how a chip can be generated from a high-level object-oriented software specification, targeting introductory-level chip design learners with only very light performance requirements, while maintaining mental continuity between the chip layout and the software source program. In our approach, each software object is represented as a corresponding region on the die, producing a one-to-one structural mapping that preserves these familiar abstractions throughout the design flow. To support this mapping, we employ a modular construction strategy in which vertically composed IP blocks implement the behavioral protocols expressed in software. A direct syntactic translation, however, cannot meet hardware-level efficiency or communication constraints. For this reason, we leverage formal type systems based on sequences that check whether interactions between hardware modules adhere to the communication patterns described in the software model. We further examine hardware interconnect strategies for composing many such modules and develop layout techniques suited to this object-aligned design style. Together, these contributions preserve mental continuity from software to chip design for new learners and enables practical layout generation, ultimately reducing the expertise required for software developers to participate in chip creation.

Result: The proposed design was validated with Iris and MNIST datasets, demonstrating energy efficiency, scalability, and viability as a research-grade platform.

Conclusion: The processor is an adaptable, low-cost, energy-efficient platform suitable for spiking neural network applications, enhancing neuromorphic research accessibility.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural systems, holds immense promise for ultra-low-power and real-time inference applications. However, limited access to flexible, open-source platforms continues to hinder widespread adoption and experimentation. In this paper, we present a low-cost neuromorphic processor implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA platform. The processor supports all-to-all configurable connectivity and employs the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with customizable parameters such as threshold, synaptic weights, and refractory period. Communication with the host system is handled via a UART interface, enabling runtime reconfiguration without hardware resynthesis. The architecture was validated using benchmark datasets including the Iris classification and MNIST digit recognition tasks. Post-synthesis results highlight the design's energy efficiency and scalability, establishing its viability as a research-grade neuromorphic platform that is both accessible and adaptable for real-world spiking neural network applications. This implementation will be released as open source following project completion.

*Zhenguo Liu,Chengao Shi,Chen Ding,Jiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemanticBBV, a framework that generates performance-aware program signatures for microarchitecture simulation, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like Basic Block Vector lack semantic content and cross-program adaptability, limiting their performance and optimization potential for simulation acceleration.

Method: SemanticBBV employs a RWKV-based semantic encoder to create rich embeddings of assembly blocks, aggregated via a Set Transformer with distinctiveness and performance sensitivity objectives.

Result: SemanticBBV matched traditional accuracy for single-program analysis and achieved 86.3% average accuracy in cross-program performance estimation, with a massive 7143x simulation speedup.

Conclusion: SemanticBBV effectively accelerates simulation and improves accuracy by leveraging semantic embedding and model adaptability, showing promise for broadly applicable microarchitecture simulations.

Abstract: For decades, sampling-based techniques have been the de facto standard for accelerating microarchitecture simulation, with the Basic Block Vector (BBV) serving as the cornerstone program representation. Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped.
  To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning.

*Luciano Floridi,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,David Watson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their stochastic nature and non-abductive reasoning while highlighting consequences for evaluation and application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs leverage token-completion methods in reasoning and their relation to human abductive reasoning.

Method: The study analyzes reasoning structures in LLM outputs, provides examples, and draws comparisons with human abductive reasoning.

Result: LLMs mimic commonsense reasoning and produce plausible outputs, but they lack grounding in truth, verification, or real abductive reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs assist idea generation but require critical assessment as they cannot validate truth. The paper addresses objections and limitations, offering an evaluation.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

*Yumou Wei,John Stamper,Paulo F. Carvalho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates using small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation with a novel pipeline that combines text generation and probabilistic reasoning and shows promising results in generating high-quality, objective-aligning questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether smaller and less resource-intensive language models can still contribute effectively to question generation, as large language models are currently dominant in this area.

Method: The paper introduces a "generate-then-validate" approach, which uses expansive generation to create candidate questions followed by validation using probabilistic reasoning. Two evaluation studies involve human experts and a large language model to gauge quality.

Result: The evaluations indicate that the questions generated by the pipeline are high-quality, have clear answers, and align with intended learning objectives.

Conclusion: Small language models, when guided by an appropriate pipeline, can serve as a valuable tool for question generation while offering a resource-efficient alternative to large language models.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DeepNews Framework to tackle the challenges faced by language models in achieving accurate, coherent, and personalized text generation in vertical domains like financial reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the 'impossible trinity' faced by current LLMs in vertical domain text generation: reducing hallucination, ensuring logical coherence, and delivering personalized expression, while overcoming the limitations of existing generative paradigms caused by the Statistical Smoothing Trap.

Method: The proposed DeepNews Framework is based on three modules: dual-granularity retrieval with a 10:1 information saturation ratio, schema-guided strategic planning using domain knowledge bases, and adversarial constraint prompting techniques to mitigate the smoothness of model-generated text.

Result: The framework identifies a Knowledge Cliff in financial reporting, demonstrating that content truthfulness collapses below 15,000-character context, while redundant inputs beyond 30,000 characters stabilize over 85% Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR). In real-world tests, DeepNews achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate versus 0% by GPT-5.

Conclusion: DeepNews effectively models cognitive processes of expert financial journalists, overcoming major bottlenecks in LLM-based text generation with superior performance and ecological validity.

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

*Moonsoo Park,Jeongseok Yun,Bohyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses personalized review response generation by inferring user personas from short reviews using a novel two-stage prompting framework, enhancing response relevance and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve engagement and effectiveness of responses generated by large language models in scenarios with limited user information, such as food delivery platforms.

Method: A two-stage prompting framework is proposed. It uses short review texts to infer explicit (user preferences) and implicit (demographics or stylistic) personas. These inferred attributes guide tailored response generation, with adjustments like decoding temperature to ensure diversity and fidelity.

Result: Evaluation on a Korean food delivery app dataset shows improvements in precision, diversity, and semantic consistency of generated replies.

Conclusion: Persona-augmented prompting enhances automated response personalization and relevance effectively, without the need for model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

*Lama Alssum,Hani Itani,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of safety degradation in fine-tuned large language models by framing it as a continual learning problem and evaluates various mitigation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve the safety of large language models during fine-tuning, especially as they are adapted to new tasks and risks from the democratization of these models increase.

Method: The authors evaluate regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging continual learning methods to mitigate safety issues during fine-tuning for both benign and poisoned user data.

Result: Continual learning methods, particularly DER, were found to reduce attack success rates while maintaining task performance across various tasks and model families.

Conclusion: Continual learning methods offer a promising solution to mitigate safety degradation in LLM fine-tuning and ensure task utility and safety across diverse models and tasks.

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important with their democratization. In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMedic, a framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing static medical QA benchmarks by evaluating LLMs in dynamic, multi-turn clinical conversations while ensuring multi-faceted assessments of their performance.

Method: AutoMedic transforms static QA datasets into virtual patient simulations for multi-turn clinical scenarios. It evaluates LLMs using the CARE metric, considering conversational accuracy, efficiency, empathy, and robustness.

Result: The AutoMedic framework, validated by human experts, provides realistic and clinically relevant evaluations of LLMs as clinical conversational agents.

Conclusion: AutoMedic is a valid and practical tool for developing and assessing medical LLMs in dynamic conversational settings.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the accessibility and utility of Vision-Language Models to a broader range of non-English languages.

Method: The paper compares various methods, including translation-based pipelines, LoRA fine-tuning, and two-stage fine-tuning, to adapt English-trained VLMs to other languages. Evaluation is done using translated benchmarks and manual assessments.

Result: Dataset translation acts as a significant bottleneck, affecting training and evaluation outcomes. Data quality is a key limiting factor.

Conclusion: Improved native-language dataset collection and enhanced translation methods are crucial for advancing multilingual capabilities in Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

TL;DR: The Confucius Code Agent (CCA) is introduced as an open-source AI software engineer designed for industrial-scale workloads, leveraging the Confucius SDK platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing coding agents in industrial-scale workloads while providing transparency, extensibility, and reproducibility.

Method: CCA is built on the Confucius SDK, incorporating hierarchical memory, persistent note-taking, modular extensions, and a meta-agent for automated agent development.

Result: CCA achieves state-of-the-art performance (54.3% Resolve@1 on SWE-Bench-Pro) in real-world software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Confucius SDK and CCA offer a robust, transparent, and scalable foundation bridging research and production AI systems, facilitating industrial-scale agent development.

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

*Yijiong Yu,Jiale Liu,Qingyun Wu,Huazheng Wang,Ji Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a method to address performance issues when applying sliding window attention to pre-trained large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of long-context inference in Transformer-based large language models due to the quadratic scaling of the self-attention mechanism.

Method: Proposed SWAA, combining five adaptation techniques: prefilling SWA, preserving sink tokens, interleaving FA/SWA layers, chain-of-thought reasoning, and fine-tuning.

Result: SWAA effectively adapts models to sliding window attention, recovering long-context performance through synergistic combinations of the methods.

Conclusion: SWAA demonstrates that long-context inference using SWA is feasible with the proposed approach, providing performance-efficiency trade-offs and practical recommendations for application.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoopRAG, a cooperative framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), improving question-answering performance by enhancing document retrieval through cooperation between retrievers and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of RAG methods, particularly incorrect retrievals and hallucinations in question answering tasks, by creating a more effective collaboration between retrievers and LLMs.

Method: CoopRAG unrolls questions into sub-questions and masked reasoning chains, retrieves relevant documents, reranks them using contrasting retriever layers, and reconstructs reasoning chains by filling masked positions in collaboration with LLMs.

Result: CoopRAG outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on both multi-hop and simple QA datasets, achieving better retrieval and question-answering performances.

Conclusion: CoopRAG demonstrates the efficacy of cooperative frameworks in RAG by addressing inaccuracies in retrieval and reasoning, enabling better QA outcomes.

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

Result: T-pro 2.0 delivers efficient inference capabilities, direct answers, and reasoning-trace generation, demonstrating practical performance in reasoning tasks and reduced latency.

Conclusion: T-pro 2.0 is a comprehensive platform for studying Russian LLMs, significantly contributing to hybrid reasoning and efficient inference systems and allowing users to explore, adapt, or extend the model further.

Abstract: We introduce T-pro 2.0, an open-weight Russian LLM for hybrid reasoning and efficient inference. The model supports direct answering and reasoning-trace generation, using a Cyrillic-dense tokenizer and an adapted EAGLE speculative-decoding pipeline to reduce latency. To enable reproducible and extensible research, we release the model weights, the T-Wix 500k instruction corpus, the T-Math reasoning benchmark, and the EAGLE weights on Hugging Face. These resources allow users to study Russian-language reasoning and to extend or adapt both the model and the inference pipeline. A public web demo exposes reasoning and non-reasoning modes and illustrates the speedups achieved by our inference stack across domains. T-pro 2.0 thus serves as an accessible open system for building and evaluating efficient, practical Russian LLM applications.

TL;DR: The study addresses automated paraphrasing tools that disguise plagiarism by generating improbable synonyms and proposes SRAP to detect and reconstruct original text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to combat adversarial text generation techniques that obscure plagiarism in scientific literature and threaten its integrity.

Method: A two-stage framework combining statistical anomaly detection (using SciBERT for token-level analysis) and semantic reconstruction (using FAISS and SBERT for source alignment).

Result: The SRAP approach achieves 23.67% restoration accuracy of original text, outperforming zero-shot baselines (0%) and demonstrating the necessity of static decision thresholds for scientific jargon detection.

Conclusion: SRAP effectively addresses obfuscated text through detection and mathematical reconstruction, enabling forensic tracing to source documents and enhancing plagiarism detection in scientific literature.

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

Result: Pilot study showed increased motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic improvements among university students.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling can create adaptive systems for better educational support.

Abstract: This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 for their sensitivity to syntactic structures using subject-auxiliary inversion and parasitic gap licensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs trained solely on surface forms can demonstrate sensitivity to underlying syntactic structures.

Method: The study tested LLMs using prompts to elicit acceptability ratings for two syntactic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion and parasitic gap licensing.

Result: LLMs reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical constructions, indicating sensitivity to syntactic structures beyond linear sequence.

Conclusion: Large language models exhibit functional sensitivity to syntax derived from predictive training, even without explicit structural encoding.

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

TL;DR: The paper discusses enhancing LLMs for underrepresented languages through optimizing language data distribution and introducing novel training methodologies like XDoGE. A new IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model is proposed for Iberian and English languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the over-reliance of LLMs on high-resource languages, which negatively impacts performance in mid- and low-resource languages.

Method: The approach involves training a small proxy model with the XDoGE algorithm, rescaling data weights, and using two training strategies: training models from scratch or through continual pre-training (CPT).

Result: Using Salamandra-2b and IberoBench for evaluation, significant improvements in supporting Iberian and English languages were observed, including better handling of over- and under-sampled data.

Conclusion: The proposed methodologies and model demonstrate effective improvements in multilingual capabilities, especially for mid- and low-resource languages, advancing the utility of LLMs for diverse linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) is effective for causal reasoning and concludes that fine-tuned encoder models outperform decoder-only models in reliability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the role and limitations of in-context learning (ICL) in LLMs for causal reasoning tasks requiring multihop and conjunctive control.

Method: The authors compare fine-tuned encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures under zero- and few-shot settings for natural and non-natural language scenarios.

Result: The results reveal that ICL alone struggles with causal reasoning, showing brittleness in decoder-only models and robust generalization in fine-tuned encoder or encoder-decoder architectures.

Conclusion: Encoder or encoder-decoder models with targeted finetuning are better suited for short-horizon robust causal reasoning, given their reliability and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoleRMBench, a benchmark for role-playing dialogue evaluation, and RoleRM, a new reward model. RoleRM is shown to outperform other models in subjective alignment and narrative coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models fail to align LLMs effectively with human preferences in subjective and open-ended domains like role-play dialogues, especially on nuanced and persona-grounded judgments.

Method: The authors introduce RoleRMBench, a specific benchmark for role-playing dialogue evaluations, and propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP) for subjective evaluation with consistent pairwise supervision.

Result: RoleRM outperforms existing general-purpose reward models by over 24% on average on metrics like narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

Conclusion: The work establishes the importance of continuous preference representation and consistent annotation, advancing subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural model integrating speech, vision, and text, along with datasets and benchmarks for agricultural AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive benchmarks, limiting AI's potential in agriculture.

Method: The authors built a scalable pipeline for training data, created the largest agricultural speech dataset, and trained the AgriGPT-Omni model with a three-stage approach: textual knowledge injection, multimodal alignment, and reinforcement learning. The AgriBench-Omni-2K benchmark was also introduced.

Result: AgriGPT-Omni outperforms general-purpose baselines in multilingual, multimodal reasoning, and real-world speech understanding. A novel tri-modal benchmark for agriculture is also delivered.

Conclusion: AgriGPT-Omni, along with its datasets and benchmarks, advances agricultural AI by integrating multilingual and multimodal capabilities, promoting inclusive and sustainable AI for low-resource regions.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

### [78] [From Data Scarcity to Data Care: Reimagining Language Technologies for Serbian and other Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10630)
*Smiljana Antonijevic Ubois*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenges faced by low-resource languages like Serbian in language technology development and proposes a framework, Data Care, to create more inclusive and sustainable language technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the linguistic and cultural biases in language models predominantly trained in high-resource languages, and address the challenges in supporting low-resource languages like Serbian, both historically and in the AI age.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with ten experts (linguists, digital humanists, AI developers) to identify challenges and proposed the Data Care framework based on CARE principles.

Result: The study identified key challenges like historical text heritage loss, reliance on English-trained models, and lack of cultural specificity in dataset curation, and presented Data Care as a potential model to counter these issues.

Conclusion: Data Care, with its emphasis on inclusion, sustainability, and nuanced cultural awareness in corpus and language technology design, serves as a promising approach for addressing power imbalances in traditional language model development.

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in training data for large language models (LLMs), proposing a four-step pipeline to detect and mitigate representation bias and stereotypes, and evaluates its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comply with laws like the European AI Act and prevent unfair outputs from LLMs by tackling biases inherent in the training data.

Method: The pipeline includes group label detection via LLM-generated word lists, quantifying representation bias through Demographic Representation Score, filtering stereotypes with sociolinguistic methods, and counterfactual data augmentation to compensate bias.

Result: The pipeline effectively reduces representation bias and stereotypes in text datasets. However, fine-tuning LLMs on the debiased data does not consistently eliminate model bias, revealing gaps in bias evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: Targeted data manipulation is critical for addressing biases in language model outputs, though current evaluation techniques require improvement for effectiveness verification.

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

TL;DR: This paper introduces OPV, a new verifier for improving reasoning accuracy in large language models, achieving notable performance improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifiers struggle with inspecting intermediate reasoning steps or rely heavily on costly human annotations, necessitating a more efficient and effective approach.

Method: The proposed OPV uses an iterative active learning framework with Rejection Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards to enhance verification through expert annotations and progressive optimization.

Result: OPV achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming larger models with an F1 score of 83.1, improves detection of false positives, and enhances policy model performance significantly.

Conclusion: OPV demonstrates strong reasoning verification capabilities and scalability, offering a promising pathway to more accurate reasoning frameworks in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a dispatcher-support system designed to improve emergency response for Caribbean populations by addressing speech recognition challenges caused by regional English accents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency speech recognition systems fail to accurately process non-standard English varieties, leaving Caribbean populations underserved during crises.

Method: The proposed system integrates Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, entity extraction using large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to enhance triage protocols.

Result: TRIDENT signals include transcription quality, clinical entity identification, and vocal stress markers, enabling prioritization even when speech recognition fails.

Conclusion: TRIDENT outlines an architecture for equitable AI triage access for diverse accents, ensuring effective emergency services for Caribbean populations.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

Result: Extensive experiments show OPV outperforms larger models, achieving an F1 score of 83.1 on OPV-Bench and improving reasoning models' accuracy. It aligns well with expert evaluations and boosts performance on datasets like AIME2025.

Conclusion: OPV is proven effective for large-scale, cost-efficient verification of reasoning tasks, outperforming existing models and aligning with expert assessments for improved reasoning and reliability.

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling pretrained models as a method to adapt to medium- and lower-resource languages and shows that larger upscaled models outperform smaller ones in terms of resource efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenge of achieving high-performing language models, especially for medium- and lower-resource languages, by examining scalable adaptation strategies.

Method: The method involves scaling up English base language models and conducting ablations with FLOP-matched models to test performance in resource-efficient adaptation, including merging scaled models into multilingual systems.

Result: Larger upscaled models, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, match or surpass smaller models continually pretrained on higher volumes of data and maintain English capabilities while reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Scaling facilitates resource-efficient and effective adaptation for target languages, preserves English model abilities, and offers opportunities to optimize multilingual systems via improved merging methods.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

*Manurag Khullar,Utkarsh Desai,Poorva Malviya,Aman Dalmia,Zheyuan Ryan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in maternal healthcare triage in India, showing a notable drop in performance when compared to native scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical contexts in India, where users often prefer romanized text. However, the impact of this orthographic variation on LLM performance in healthcare is underexplored.

Method: The paper benchmarks LLMs on real-world maternal health queries in both native scripts and romanized formats across five Indian languages and Nepali.

Result: Models consistently underperform in processing romanized text, with F1 scores dropping by 5-12 points, potentially causing millions of errors in healthcare triage.

Conclusion: LLMs handling romanized inputs exhibit vulnerabilities despite their semantic understanding, presenting a safety issue for health-related applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

Conclusion: This actively maintained leaderboard enables external participation and standardized comparison, fostering advancements in language model factuality measurement.

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing accuracy, latency, and cost in multi-class and multi-label text classification tasks.

Method: Fusion of embeddings from traditional ML backbones and LLM-derived scores, followed by using a compact FusionMLP for prediction.

Result: Achieved robust performance such as 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on Reuters 21578 topic classification.

Conclusion: LabelFusion demonstrates the complementary strengths of traditional classifiers and LLMs, offering a practical, high-performance solution for text classification.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

TL;DR: The study uses computational text analysis to analyze emotional tones in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, revealing patterns of positive emotions and calmness throughout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how digital tools can uncover emotional patterns and rhythms in classic literary texts.

Method: Dialogue was extracted using regular expressions, scored on emotional dimensions via the NRC-VAD lexicon, and visualized using emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds.

Result: The analysis found a generally positive, calm tone and a growth in agency throughout the story, highlighting the interplay of emotions and tension in The Hobbit.

Conclusion: Computational text analysis successfully revealed subtle emotional rhythms in The Hobbit, showcasing the potential of digital methods for literary analysis.

Abstract: This study analyzes the emotional tone of dialogue in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to evaluate the capability of multimodal generative AI in emotional analysis from political audio-visual materials, given its potential for significant advancements.

Method: The study assesses mLLMs by analyzing emotional arousal in human-labeled video datasets, including both ideal circumstances and real-world parliamentary debates.

Result: Under ideal settings, mLLMs provide reliable and unbiased emotional arousal ratings. In contrast, they perform poorly in real-world parliamentary debates, potentially affecting downstream analysis.

Conclusion: Thorough evaluation of generative AI methods is essential for their role in political studies, and this paper proposes a framework that can be replicated for such assessments.

Abstract: Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.

TL;DR: The paper discusses experiments using a multi-agent computational system for language acquisition, where a 'daughter' language model learns grammatical knowledge from data generated by a 'mother' language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how abstract grammatical structures can be acquired without direct access to a language model’s internal knowledge, reflecting natural language learning.

Method: The study utilizes a multi-agent system with a mother and daughter language model. It applies hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to the mother model's generated utterances, enabling the daughter model to deduce grammatical rules and categories.

Result: The daughter model successfully acquires abstract grammatical knowledge resembling linguists' natural language grammatical categories using statistical analysis of input data.

Conclusion: The computational system demonstrates the feasibility of acquiring non-trivial grammatical rules just from exposure to language data, mimicking naturalistic language learning processes.

Abstract: This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.

Motivation: There is a need for low-latency, power-efficient eye tracking systems for emerging AR/VR technologies, where conventional systems suffer from drawbacks like motion blur and high computational cost.

Method: The authors redesigned traditional event-based eye-tracking models by incorporating lightweight LIF layers and depth-wise separable convolutions into SNNs to enhance efficiency.

Result: The models achieved mean errors of 3.7-4.1px, comparable to specialized neuromorphic systems, while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that event-based eye-tracking architectures can be effectively redesigned as spiking neural networks, achieving significant efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

### [91] [ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031)
*Woojin Lee,Hyugjae Chang,Jaeho Moon,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ABBSPO, a new framework for weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD), improving accuracy by addressing scale estimation and orientation prediction issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of weakly supervised object detection using only horizontal bounding box annotations under weak supervision settings.

Method: The proposed framework introduces adaptive bounding box scaling (ABBS) for better scale estimation and a symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction (SPA loss) that uses aerial object symmetry for more accurate self-supervised learning.

Result: ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art results for weakly supervised oriented object detection, surpassing previous methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: ABBSPO provides an effective and efficient framework for WS-OOD by leveraging scale-optimized GT bounding boxes and symmetry-based orientation strategies.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid method combining diffusion models with autoregressive models for image captioning, achieving State-of-the-Art results on the COCO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of diffusion models in discrete domains where they struggle to outperform autoregressive solutions.

Method: The paper proposes integrating diffusion models as suggestion tools to support autoregressive generation, combining bidirectional refinement with linguistic structure.

Result: The proposed Show, Suggest and Tell (SST) achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D score on COCO dataset, surpassing previous State-of-the-Art results by 1.5-2.5 points without Reinforcement Learning.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of combining diffusion and autoregressive models, suggesting a promising direction for improving generative tasks in discrete domains.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaVoxel is a joint generative diffusion model for imaging and clinical data that unifies various tasks and supports flexible inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI approaches generally require separate models for each task or predictive direction, limiting their flexibility.

Method: MetaVoxel employs a single generative joint diffusion process to model the joint distribution of imaging data and clinical metadata.

Result: MetaVoxel achieves comparable performance to task-specific baselines in image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction using a unified framework.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal diffusion models like MetaVoxel show potential to simplify and broaden medical AI applications, eliminating the need for task-specific models.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with achieving human-like compositional generalization.

Method: Proposes Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to link words in sentences with corresponding image features, using two models with either fully or partially disentangled visual representations.

Result: The models demonstrate improved generalization on unseen compositions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: IDE effectively enhances compositional generalization capabilities in vision-language models.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Nevertheless, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like compositional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connection between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Motivation: Traditional rendering methods struggle with achieving precise specular reflections in dynamic scenes due to limitations in direction estimation and physical reflection modeling.

Method: The paper introduces a 2D Gaussian Splatting representation to model dynamic geometry and material properties, coupled with a Dynamic Environment Gaussian for reflection modeling, and a hybrid pipeline for rendering specular and diffuse components.

Result: TraceFlow achieves superior specular reflection quality in dynamic environments, outperforming existing methodologies in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: TraceFlow provides a framework for sharper, realistic specular renderings in dynamic scenes, addressing key limitations of prior methods through innovative modeling and training strategies.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in breast cancer screening mammography by improving model robustness using topological data analysis, achieving better cross-population performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer has high mortality, and while mammography reduces death rates, challenges with false positives/negatives and reduced accuracy across populations highlight the need for better predictive tools.

Method: The authors employ a wavelet-based vectorization of persistent homology to generate stability-prone spatial maps, integrating these into a two-stage detection pipeline with channel concatenation.

Result: Implemented on U.S. (CBIS-DDSM) data and evaluated on external datasets from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), this approach improves INbreast's patient-level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 with minimal training.

Conclusion: Incorporating wavelet persistence channels into mammography analysis significantly enhances cross-population model performance, offering potential for improved global breast cancer detection.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation. The model is trained and validated on the CBIS DDSM digitized film mammography cohort from the United States and evaluated on two independent full field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with performance reported at the patient level. On INbreast, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increases patient level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under a limited training budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome bandwidth, privacy, and efficiency issues when deploying DNNs on edge devices and to enhance split inference between edge and cloud.

Method: The paper presents the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), a codec pipeline for intermediate feature compression within the FCM standard.

Result: The proposed method achieved 85.14% average bitrate reduction across various vision tasks, preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: FCM provides a scalable and efficient solution for deploying intelligent machine vision features in bandwidth-constrained and privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive), which focuses on reasoning through latent representations rather than natural language for improved autonomous driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language-based reasoning in Vision-Language-Action models may not be the most efficient representation for challenging autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: LCDrive employs latent representations for reasoning, combining action-proposals and world model tokens grounded in a learned latent world model. It is trained through supervised learning and reinforced with closed-loop reinforcement learning.

Result: LCDrive demonstrates faster inference, improved trajectory quality, and better performance during reinforcement learning compared to prior text-reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning in LCDrive enhances decision making, safety, and overall performance in autonomous driving compared to text-based reasoning models, offering a promising alternative solution.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Velibor Adzic,Hari Kalva,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel compression system, Feature Coding for Machines (FCM), for efficient machine-to-machine communication by replacing pixel-based video transfer with compressed intermediate neural features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transitioning from pixel/image-based data transmission to task-aware, neural-feature coding to enhance bandwidth efficiency, maintain privacy, and reduce dependency on human-centric codecs in machine-to-machine communication.

Method: The researchers developed the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) system, leveraging task-aware coding tools to compress neural features. They tested the performance of different codecs (H.264, H.265/HEVC, H.266/VVC) as inner codecs in the compression pipeline.

Result: FCM delivered similar accuracy to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. H.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC had comparable performance metrics, with a minor BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when replacing VVC with HEVC. Codec H.264 resulted in a higher BD-Rate (32.28%) compared to VVC.

Conclusion: FCM improves machine-to-machine communication, reducing bandwidth without compromising accuracy or privacy. HEVC and VVC codecs support deployments efficiently, demonstrating feasible codec performance for tracking tasks even with older hardware.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in scalar reward aggregation within standard DPO for aligning diffusion models and proposes MCDPO, a method introducing disentangled reward axis optimization to resolve conflicts, enabling dynamic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback uses scalar rewards that conflict between evaluation axes, hampering model optimization, which creates barriers in balancing multi-dimensional feedback.

Method: The proposed MCDPO method resolves reward conflicts by injecting preference vectors during training using a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective and introducing dimensional reward dropout for balanced optimization.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion models (1.5 and SDXL) confirm MCDPO's superior benchmark performance and demonstrate dynamic multi-axis control using Classifier Free Guidance.

Conclusion: MCDPO successfully addresses reward alignment issues in diffusion models, promoting independent reward optimization and enhancing control flexibility without extra training requirements.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning (SSFSL) by improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through simple finetuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase the real-world applicability of SSFSL (e.g., auto-annotation tasks), leveraging powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their open-source data is essential.

Method: The authors diagnose the underperformance of current techniques and propose SWIFT: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning. This method improves VLM finetuning by initializing classifiers and tuning temperature to enhance pseudo-label confidence.

Result: SWIFT increases the utilization of unlabeled data and significantly improves model performance by 5% accuracy on standard SSFSL benchmarks compared to existing FSL and SSL methods.

Conclusion: SWIFT establishes the importance of leveraging open-source pre-trained resources and simple finetuning strategies to achieve significant SSFSL performance gains, even rivaling supervised learning.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

TL;DR: RobustSora is a benchmark designed to evaluate watermark robustness in AI-generated content (AIGC) video detection by testing watermark manipulation impacts on detector models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the current gap in AI-generated video detection benchmarks, which fail to consider the impact of digital watermarks embedded by generative models.

Method: RobustSora is developed as a benchmark with a dataset of 6,500 videos categorized into four types based on watermark presence and authenticity. Two evaluation tasks are designed to test watermark manipulation effects, and experiments are conducted with ten different models to assess their dependency on watermarks.

Result: The study found that watermark manipulation impacts detector model performance by 2-8 percentage points. Transformer models showed a consistent moderate dependency, while MLLMs exhibited diverse patterns of dependency.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize a partial dependency on watermarks in AIGC video detectors and propose the need for watermark-aware training strategies to improve robustness in detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of spatial structure information versus global semantic information in generative training using representation alignment, and introduces iREPA for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether global semantic information or spatial structure in target representations plays a more critical role in generative model performance, challenging existing beliefs.

Method: The authors conduct a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 vision encoders and propose two modifications: using a convolutional layer instead of an MLP for representation projection and introducing spatial normalization to enhance spatial information transfer.

Result: The study finds that spatial structure is more important than global semantic accuracy for generation performance. The iREPA method improves training speed and performance across diverse encoders and configurations.

Conclusion: Spatial structure is vital for generative performance, outperforming global semantic accuracy. The iREPA method offers a simple, effective improvement to representation alignment strategies in generative training.

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Conclusion: THE-Pose effectively combines image-based topological context with 3D geometry, addressing the challenges in 6D pose estimation and demonstrating superior performance on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

*Rui Wang,Yimu Sun,Jingxing Guo,Huisi Wu,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GDKVM, a new model improving segmentation in echocardiography videos through innovative methods addressing spatiotemporal and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in echocardiography segmentation caused by noise, motion, and limitations of current methods in balancing spatiotemporal dependencies with efficiency.

Method: GDKVM, leveraging Linear Key-Value Association for inter-frame correlations, Gated Delta Rule for memory storage, and Key-Pixel Feature Fusion for scale feature integration.

Result: Demonstrated superior segmentation performance and robustness on CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GDKVM improves segmentation accuracy and robustness in echocardiographic videos, maintaining real-time performance for clinical application.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

*Yuetong Su,Baoguo Wei,Xinyu Wang,Xu Li,Lixin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal framework, LLM-NCD, that combines visual and textual semantics for Novel Class Discovery, achieving significant performance improvements and resilience against long-tail distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing Novel Class Discovery methods, such as poor feature discriminability and challenges with long-tail data distribution.

Method: The authors introduce a multimodal framework combining visual and textual semantics, leveraging prototype-guided clustering, and employing a dual-phase discovery mechanism separating known and unknown samples dynamically.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate up to 25.3% accuracy improvement on unknown classes compared to existing methods, showcasing resilience to long-tail distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-NCD framework effectively advances Novel Class Discovery tasks by improving accuracy for unknown classes and addressing challenges posed by long-tail data distributions.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

*Chen Ziwen,Hao Tan,Peng Wang,Zexiang Xu,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Long-LRM++ achieves high-quality real-time scene reconstruction and novel-view depth prediction using a semi-explicit scene representation and lightweight decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in explicit Gaussians causing blurring and the inefficiency of implicit methods in real-time rendering.

Method: Develop a semi-explicit scene representation coupled with a lightweight decoder for efficient rendering and improved scalability.

Result: Long-LRM++ achieves rendering quality comparable to prior methods while enabling real-time performance at 14 FPS on A100 GPUs. It scales to 64 input views and improves novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2.

Conclusion: Long-LRM++ combines the benefits of implicit and explicit models, ensuring both high fidelity and real-time efficiency, validated through extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable Gaussian splatting (GS) have enabled feed-forward reconstruction of scenes from tens of input views. Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\times540$ resolution, achieving 360° scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential "decompression" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAAD, a method to enhance robustness transfer during adversarial distillation from strong teachers to compact students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation often lacks the usage of state-of-the-art robust teacher networks, and robust saturation limits the robustness transfer.

Method: SAAD (Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation) reweights training samples based on a calculated transferability metric to improve adversarial robustness.

Result: SAAD achieves consistent improvements in adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAAD effectively enhances robustness transfer from a robust teacher to a compact student, overcoming robust saturation with no additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MotionEdit, a dataset aimed at enhancing models' abilities to edit motion in images while maintaining realism and identity, and MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate such models. To improve motion editing, it proposes MotionNFT, a fine-tuning framework which significantly enhances motion fidelity and editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the ability to edit subject motion in images while preserving realism, identity, and structure, addressing deficiencies in existing datasets and models on motion editing tasks.

Method: Developing MotionEdit (a realistic, high-fidelity motion-centric image dataset), MotionEdit-Bench (an evaluation benchmark), and MotionNFT (a motion-guided fine-tuning framework leveraging motion alignment rewards).

Result: MotionNFT improves editing quality and motion fidelity in state-of-the-art diffusion models, as confirmed by experiments on various datasets. Benchmark results highlight the difficulty of motion editing tasks for current models.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the significance of motion-centric editing, providing datasets, benchmarks, and fine-tuning frameworks to advance this research area and demonstrating the effectiveness of their solution in improving state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Xiaoxue Wu,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ShotDirector, a framework for improving multi-shot video generation by integrating camera control and hierarchical prompts for editing patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods focus on visual consistency but neglect cinematographic transitions and professional editing patterns, creating less intentional shot changes.

Method: The framework uses a camera control module with 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings, combined with a shot-aware mask mechanism, to incorporate high-level editing guidance.

Result: ShotDirector effectively achieves film-like controllable shot transitions and demonstrates success in experiments using the newly constructed dataset, ShotWeaver40K.

Conclusion: ShotDirector enhances multi-shot video generation by bridging parameter-level controls with semantic guidance, aiding in professional-level video narration and editing transitions.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in current 3D synthesis methods, such as oversimplification of light properties and poor adaptability across different scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-branch conditioning framework to handle isotropic and anisotropic components in data, hybrid pose-agnostic anchoring for depth and material transitions, and integrates radiography simulation with 360° rendering in one inference pipeline.

Result: This technology achieves superior SSIM and LPIPS metrics on datasets like Mip-NeRF 360 and RealEstate10K, and demonstrates its capability for rapid, photorealistic rendering without scene-specific tuning.

Conclusion: Disentangled360 offers a novel approach for applications in medical imaging, robotics, and mixed-reality by delivering efficient, high-quality scene reconstructions across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

TL;DR: Efficient-VLN addresses training efficiency in Vision-Language Navigation models by reducing computation and improving exploration, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly lower training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the excessive computational cost in training multimodal large language models for Vision-Language Navigation, with a focus on managing historical observations and exploration efficiency.

Method: The authors propose Efficient-VLN, introducing two efficient memory mechanisms—progressive and recursive memory—and a dynamic mixed policy to improve training efficiency and performance.

Result: Efficient-VLN achieved state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR), while drastically reducing computational training requirements (282 H800 GPU hours).

Conclusion: Efficient-VLN mitigates key computational challenges in VLN training with innovative memory mechanisms and policy strategies, establishing a new benchmark in efficient model training and performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To address challenges in WSSS for histopathology, including inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and region-shrinkage effects, while reducing annotation costs.

Method: The paper employs a dual-modal prototype bank combining CoOp-style learnable text prompts and image prototypes, enhanced by a multi-scale representation system to improve spatial precision.

Result: Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art models, along with insights on the benefits of diverse text descriptions and complementary text-image prototypes.

Conclusion: Textual semantics and visual prototype learning jointly enhance WSSS in histopathology, offering a practical approach to improve localization and segmentation under weak supervision efficiently.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a prototype learning framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology, combining semantics from CONCH and multi-scale spatial cues from SegFormer for better pseudo-mask generation and tissue localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of WSSS models, which often only detect the most discriminative regions of tissue and fail to capture the full spatial extent of morphological structures in histopathological images.

Method: They propose combining representations from vision-language models (CONCH) and segmentation backbones (SegFormer), along with text-guided prototype initialization and structural distillation mechanisms, to generate high-quality pseudo-masks without pixel-level annotations.

Result: The proposed method improves the localization completeness and semantic consistency on the BCSS-WSSS dataset. It outperforms traditional WSSS methods and achieves better computational efficiency using frozen model backbones and lightweight adapters.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates complementary strengths of vision-language models and segmentation backbones to produce effective WSSS in histopathology, demonstrating enhanced performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

*Chao Gong,Depeng Wang,Zhipeng Wei,Ya Guo,Huijia Zhu,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingPixels introduces a method to address token reduction in Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) leveraging audio-visual cross-modal synergies to reduce computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency in token reduction strategies for AV-LLMs, which struggle due to audio-visual cross-modal synergies and dynamic information densities.

Method: The paper proposes the EchoingPixels framework with Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2) that reduces joint audio-visual tokens adaptively, along with Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to preserve temporal relationships.

Result: EchoingPixels reduces token usage to 5-20% of the original tokens, achieving 2-3x speedup and memory reduction while maintaining performance comparable to strong baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully offers a novel and efficient solution for token reduction in AV-LLMs while preserving critical modeling capabilities and adapting to multimodal synergies.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

TL;DR: StainNet is a specialized foundation model tailored for special stain pathology images and built with a self-distillation SSL approach based on vision transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models in pathology are primarily trained on H&E-stained images, limiting their effectiveness for clinical applications involving other staining techniques like immunohistochemistry.

Method: The authors developed StainNet, using vision transformer architecture and self-distillation SSL, and trained it on over 1.4 million patch images from special stains using the HISTAI database.

Result: StainNet demonstrated strong performance in liver malignancy classification tasks, ROI-level dataset evaluations, few-ratio learning, and retrieval tasks, outperforming larger pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: StainNet provides an effective solution for pathology applications involving special stains and enhances the range of clinical usability beyond H&E-stained images.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

*Cai Xu,Jinlong Liu,Yilin Zhang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISMVC, a clustering method for incomplete multi-view data that employs selective imputation based on informativeness to improve performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clustering methods for incomplete multi-view data struggle with either introducing noise from indiscriminate imputation or losing cross-view complementarity under severe incompleteness.

Method: The ISMVC method selectively imputes missing positions based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, using a variational autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to stabilize clustering representations and model uncertainty.

Result: ISMVC demonstrates superior results on multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming both imputation-based and imputation-free clustering methods under challenging unbalanced and missing data scenarios.

Conclusion: ISMVC provides a lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic approach that can be integrated into existing IMC models, enabling robust clustering even in realistic incomplete data scenarios.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where different views suffer from missing and unbalanced observations, pose significant challenges for clustering. Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under a more realistic and challenging unbalanced missing scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

*Yi Liu,Yichi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenging problem of segmenting filamentous biological structures by introducing a conditional generative model to produce synthetic data that improves segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate filament segmentation in biological images is critical, but high-quality annotated datasets are challenging to produce due to the complexity of filamentous structures.

Method: The paper proposes a conditional generation framework based on Pix2Pix architecture and introduces a filament-aware structural loss to generate realistic microscopy images from binary masks.

Result: The proposed framework generates realistic filament images and improves segmentation performance, outperforming models trained without synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generated using this approach significantly enhances filament segmentation accuracy, offering a valuable solution to the data shortage issue in this domain.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

*Yi-Cheng Liao,Shyang-En Weng,Yu-Syuan Xu,Chi-Wei Hsiao,Wei-Chen Chiu,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HD-CLIP, a plug-and-play module for diffusion models to enhance Real-World Image Super-Resolution by processing real-world image degradations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods struggle with handling unknown, complex degradation in images due to reliance on limited guidance, such as CLIP encoders that cannot capture numerical severity levels of degradation.

Method: HD-CLIP, a hierarchical degradation system, uses semantic embedding and ordinal degradation embedding to model both semantic attributes and degradation severity. It integrates into diffusion models via techniques like classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG).

Result: HD-CLIP improves the fidelity and realism of generated images by suppressing artifacts and hallucinations. It works seamlessly as a plug-and-play module for various frameworks without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: HD-CLIP significantly enhances Real-ISR performance, offering better image restoration and generalization to unseen degradation levels through its novel hierarchical guidance.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

*Shresth Grover,Priyank Pathak,Akash Kumar,Vibhav Vineet,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoSPlan, a benchmark to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in visual sequential planning tasks involving error correction. It also proposes SGI, a method to improve VLMs' performance in such tasks, achieving a 5.2% improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs have shown capabilities in reasoning, their performance in visual sequential planning and handling errors during planning remains untested and underdeveloped.

Method: The authors developed CoSPlan to evaluate VLMs' abilities in error detection and corrective action in sequential tasks across 4 domains. They also introduced SGI, which adds intermediate reasoning steps to help VLMs handle planning tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs struggle with CoSPlan tasks. The proposed SGI method significantly improves VLM performance, achieving an average 5.2% performance boost.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the challenges VLMs face in sequential planning and error correction, and demonstrates that the SGI method can enhance their reasoning and applicability in these contexts.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

*Keyi Chen,Mingze Sun,Zhenyu Liu,Zhangquan Chen,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset, and proposes a novel framework for text-driven motion generation for arbitrary skeletal topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in motion generation methods, which struggle with fixed skeletal templates and lack large-scale heterogeneous motion data.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module to encode skeletal structures, which integrates with text prompts to generate semantic motions.

Result: The framework generates temporally coherent and physically plausible motions, while enabling cross-species motion transfer.

Conclusion: This research advances motion generation by creating tools that work across various skeletons and text prompts, supported by a diverse dataset.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Any4D is a scalable multi-view transformer designed for metric-scale 4D reconstruction, delivering superior accuracy (~2-3X lower error) and efficiency (~15X faster) across diverse setups compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current methods that either focus narrowly on 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking and to provide a more comprehensive 4D reconstruction approach usable with multiple input modalities.

Method: Any4D is powered by a modular framework that encodes 4D scene representations by combining egocentric and allocentric factors in local and global coordinate systems, respectively. It also integrates diverse sensor modalities beyond monocular RGB.

Result: The method achieves significantly reduced error levels (2-3X lower) and improved computational efficiency (15X faster) compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Any4D offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for 4D reconstruction, with flexibility to utilize multiple sensor modalities and potential applications in varied domains.

Abstract: We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.

*Yiheng Lyu,Lian Xu,Mohammed Bennamoun,Farid Boussaid,Coen Arrow,Girish Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TranSamba leverages a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture to enhance weakly supervised segmentation of volumetric medical images, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in medical imaging often disregard the volumetric nature by relying on 2D encoders, leading to limited comprehension and results.

Method: TranSamba combines Vision Transformers with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, enabling efficient 3D context capture using linear complexity state space models for inter-slice information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets reveal TranSamba’s superior performance and new state-of-the-art segmentation across various modalities and pathologies.

Conclusion: The TranSamba architecture provides an efficient and effective solution for volumetric medical segmentation, reinforcing its value through publicly available code and trained models.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

### [126] [mmCounter: Static People Counting in Dense Indoor Scenarios Using mmWave Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10357)
*Tarik Reza Toha,Shao-Jung,Lu,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmCounter is a novel solution enabling mmWave radars to count static individuals by detecting ultra-low frequency signals caused by breathing and micro-movements, overcoming challenges in dense indoor settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of mmWave radars in detecting dense, static groups due to poor spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection.

Method: mmCounter employs a new signal processing pipeline to identify ultra-low frequency signals (<1 Hz) produced by breathing and body micromovements, separating these from background noise and static objects, and associating them with individuals.

Result: The system exhibits strong performance with an 87% F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar settings, and a 60% F1 score with 1.1 mean absolute error in new environments, counting up to seven individuals in tight spaces.

Conclusion: mmCounter effectively addresses the challenge of counting stationary individuals in dense indoor areas, providing accurate results even in complex conditions, validating its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Motivation: MLLMs face difficulties in modeling spatial relationships within frames and understanding causal temporal dynamics in complex VideoQA tasks.

Method: A Video Toolkit is introduced for enhancing MLLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning. The STAR framework is proposed for strategic scheduling of spatial and temporal analysis tools to localize key areas in videos.

Conclusion: The proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework significantly advance MLLMs' ability to perform spatiotemporal reasoning, bringing them closer to autonomous video analysis. The accompanying code is made available publicly.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench. We believe that our proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework make an important step towards building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

### [128] [Visual Funnel: Resolving Contextual Blindness in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10362)
*Woojun Jung,Jaehoon Go,Mingyu Jeon,Sunjae Yoon,Junyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle to perceive fine visual details, and existing methods fail to maintain the connection between cropped image regions and their global context. This paper introduces the Visual Funnel to overcome this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often miss fine-grained visual details crucial for precision-focused tasks, and traditional cropping methods create a contextual disconnect.

Method: A training-free two-step approach, Visual Funnel involves Contextual Anchoring to identify relevant regions and Entropy-Scaled Portfolio to dynamically preserve hierarchical visual context.

Result: Extensive experiments show Visual Funnel outperforms naive methods, emphasizing the importance of hierarchical crop structures.

Conclusion: Visual Funnel resolves 'Contextual Blindness' by ensuring structural diversity in model input, enhancing visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2S is a zero-shot framework for retrieving temporal segments in hour-long videos using natural language queries, achieving superior performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of retrieving temporal segments in long videos using natural language queries without requiring task-specific training, aiming to overcome computational inefficiencies and poor scalability in prior approaches.

Method: P2S introduces an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to avoid candidate explosion in the search phase and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost Vision Language Models (VLMs).

Result: P2S achieves significant improvement over supervised state-of-the-art methods (+3.7% on R5@0.1 on MAD) in temporal grounding of hour-long videos.

Conclusion: The proposed P2S framework successfully addresses inefficiencies in 'Search-then-Refine' approaches, enabling scalable zero-shot temporal grounding in lengthy videos with competitive performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoherentGS, a framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under sparse and motion-blurred conditions by leveraging a dual-prior strategy combining deblurring and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting in sparse and motion-blurred real-world input imagery, which often degrades reconstruction quality.

Method: CoherentGS integrates two pre-trained generative models: a deblurring network for sharp details and photometric output, and a diffusion model for geometric priors. Additionally, it includes techniques like a consistency-guided camera exploration module and a depth regularization loss.

Result: CoherentGS achieves significant performance improvements, outperforming existing methods in 3D reconstruction from as few as 3, 6, or 9 views. The experiments cover synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-prior strategy effectively mitigates challenges of sparse and blurry input data, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task. The code and video demos are available at https://potatobigroom.github.io/CoherentGS/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RaLiFlow, a novel method for integrating radar and LiDAR data to achieve better scene flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar data, which is cheaper and more robust in various weather conditions than LiDAR, remains largely unexplored for scene flow estimation.

Method: The researchers created a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset, proposed radar denoising strategies, and developed the Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module for effective radar-LiDAR integration.

Result: RaLiFlow significantly outperformed existing single-modal methods, demonstrating improved scene flow estimation on the repurposed dataset.

Conclusion: Combining radar and LiDAR data using RaLiFlow delivers superior performance in scene flow estimation compared to single-modal approaches, addressing the limitations of radar data.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

*Alberto Rota,Elena De Momi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Deep Learning pipeline for feature correspondence in endoscopic images, improving the precision in camera tracking and 3D reconstruction for minimally invasive surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in surgical image analysis, such as weak perspective cues and deformable anatomy, which hinder the performance of conventional computer vision techniques.

Method: The study proposes a self-supervised optimization framework leveraging a novel-view synthesis pipeline to train a modified DINOv2 model with a Transformer layer for embedding generation optimized for cosine similarity matching.

Result: Experiments show that the pipeline outperformed state-of-the-art techniques on the SCARED dataset, achieving better matching precision and lower epipolar errors.

Conclusion: The proposed Deep Learning framework enhances surgical endoscopy applications by enabling precise feature correspondences, potentially improving image-guided surgery and augmented reality integration.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work. The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) undervalue fine-grained recognition, which is critical for real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a novel optimization strategy focusing on data construction (including mosaic and open-world data) and training processes, along with the introduction of the FROW benchmark.

Result: Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1%, open-world data enhances benchmark accuracy by 10%-20% and content accuracy by 6%-12%. Incorporating fine-grained data during pre-training improves category recognition accuracy up to 10%.

Conclusion: Fine-grained recognition in LVLMs can be significantly enhanced using optimized data strategies and training approaches, backed by the comprehensive FROW benchmark.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/pc-inno/FROW.

*Ge Zhang,Chunyang Wang,Bo Xiao,Xuelian Liu,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for denoising point clouds while ensuring high accuracy, edge preservation, and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research focuses on addressing the challenge of noise degradation in LiDAR-generated point clouds for tasks like autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction.

Method: The method employs spatial partitioning via octree, adaptive voxel-based statistics, kNN density estimation, and a gravitational scoring function combining density and adaptive distance weights.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show improvement in metrics like F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance, with reduced processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances denoising accuracy, edge preservation, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for multi-noise scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

*Qiyue Sun,Tailin Chen,Yinghui Zhang,Yuchen Zhang,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiHateLoc, a framework for multimodal hate speech localisation that works under weak supervision, enabling accurate identification of hateful video segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying hateful segments in multimodal videos, especially under conditions where only video-level labels are accessible, which current approaches struggle to achieve.

Method: MultiHateLoc includes temporal encoders for sequential patterns, dynamic cross-modal fusion, cross-modal contrastive alignment, and a modality-aware MIL objective to detect hateful segments under weak supervision.

Result: MultiHateLoc demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for detecting hateful segments on HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets despite using coarse video-level labels.

Conclusion: MultiHateLoc offers an effective and interpretable framework for weakly-supervised multimodal hate speech localisation, advancing both accuracy and practicality in identifying harmful content.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WildRoad, a new off-road road network dataset, and MaGRoad, a path-centric deep learning model for robust road extraction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning road extraction models fail in off-road environments due to the lack of datasets and structural weaknesses in node-centric approaches.

Method: The study creates WildRoad—a global off-road road network dataset with an interactive annotation tool—and proposes MaGRoad, a path-centric framework leveraging multi-scale visual evidence for robust road mapping.

Result: MaGRoad outperforms existing methods on the WildRoad benchmark and urban datasets while delivering faster inference speeds.

Conclusion: WildRoad and MaGRoad together enhance off-road road extraction by addressing domain gaps, improving robustness, and offering efficient applicability.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method, TransLocNet, for aerial-ground localization using LiDAR and aerial data, significantly improving accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead aerial imagery in localization tasks.

Method: The authors introduce TransLocNet, a model that uses a bird's-eye-view LiDAR representation fused with aerial semantic features through bidirectional attention. It also employs a likelihood map decoder for spatial predictions and contrastive learning for alignment.

Result: TransLocNet outperforms current methods, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter and sub-degree accuracy in both synthetic (CARLA) and real-world (KITTI) datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that TransLocNet is a robust and effective solution for aerial-ground localization, offering strong performance in diverse environments.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) challenges under domain shifts, introduces a novel geometric phenomenon (NC3+), and proposes NCTTA to realign features efficiently, achieving superior robustness to domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the performance degradation of models under domain shifts during TTA by investigating the root causes and introducing feature alignment strategies to mitigate those issues.

Method: The authors extend Neural Collapse to a sample-wise level (NC3+) and propose an alignment method, NCTTA, that combines geometric proximity and predictive confidence to improve feature-classifier alignment during TTA under domain shifts.

Result: NCTTA significantly enhances robustness to domain shifts, outperforming other methods, such as Tent, by notable margins (e.g., 14.52% improvement on ImageNet-C).

Conclusion: By addressing sample-wise misalignment and leveraging hybrid targets for realignment, NCTTA is shown to be a highly effective method for improving model robustness during TTA under various domain shifts.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

TL;DR: The paper explores applying reinforcement learning (RL) successfully to text-to-3D autoregressive generation, systematizing reward designs, RL algorithms, benchmarks, and hierarchical paradigms, while introducing an RL-enhanced model AR3D-R1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D generation faces challenges due to spatial complexity, requiring consistent global geometry and detailed textures, making it sensitive to reward design and RL algorithms.

Method: The study systematically evaluates reward dimensions, GRPO algorithm variants, introduces a benchmark (MME-3DR), and proposes a hierarchical RL approach (Hi-GRPO) for global-to-local optimization.

Result: Key findings show human preference rewards are vital, multi-modal models provide robust signals, token-level optimization is effective, and hierarchical methods improve 3D generation. The study proposes AR3D-R1.

Conclusion: RL significantly enhances text-to-3D generation, addressing spatial complexity through hierarchical modeling and systematic evaluations. Insights advance 3D generation with optimized RL paradigms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

Abstract: This work presents an efficient algorithmic framework for real-time identification, classification, and evaluation of human physiotherapy exercises using mobile devices.

Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.

### [141] [Error-Propagation-Free Learned Video Compression With Dual-Domain Progressive Temporal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10450)
*Han Li,Shaohui Li,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Xinlong Pan,Haipeng Wang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for learned video compression that incorporates dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-experts (QCMoE) to address error propagation and improve rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing temporal alignment accuracy and the contribution to error propagation during motion estimation and compensation in video compression.

Method: The proposed method utilizes dual-domain progressive temporal alignment with coarse pixel-domain and refined latent-domain alignment, incorporating a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT). Additionally, it introduces a Quality-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts (QCMoE) for dynamic quantization and continuous bitrate adaptation.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in achieving competitive rate-distortion performance while eliminating error propagation during learned video compression.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances temporal context modeling and enables quality-consistent, error-propagation-free video compression, addressing challenges in existing frameworks.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

*Khurram Ashfaq,Muhammad Tariq Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework for shape-from-focus depth estimation, combining handcrafted focus volume computation with efficient, lightweight depth refinement techniques, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome artifacts and noise in depth maps caused by traditional two-stage deep learning-based shape-from-focus methods, and to improve accuracy and generalization for depth estimation.

Method: The paper proposes a framework combining handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian kernels for multi-scale focus volume computation, a GRU-based depth refinement module for iterative depth correction, and a learned upsampling module for fine detail reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional approaches in accuracy and generalization across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves depth estimation accuracy while addressing artifacts and noise, demonstrating its effectiveness on diverse datasets and focal conditions.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Take a Peek" (TaP), which leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to improve encoder adaptability for few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) by enabling quick and efficient adaptation to novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to enhance the encoder's ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes in FSS, addressing a key bottleneck in current approaches.

Method: The proposed method, TaP, uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune encoders on limited annotated data (support set), allowing for minimal computational cost and fast adaptation while reducing catastrophic forgetting. It is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks like COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets show that TaP significantly improves segmentation performance across models and settings. It performs particularly well in multi-class scenarios and achieves strong results even with low-rank adaptations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that TaP effectively addresses encoder adaptability for FSS, leading to more robust and efficient segmentation systems for novel classes, with practical implications for real-world applications.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Blink,' a dynamic visual token resolution framework inspired by human visual perception, improving multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) visual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have limited visual perception compared to humans, who dynamically focus on salient regions in complex scenes. The study aims to improve MLLMs' visual perception via a human-inspired strategy.

Method: The proposed Blink framework features saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution, using attention maps to determine visual token saliency and applying token super-resolution selectively in a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments show Blink effectively enhances MLLMs' visual perception and multimodal understanding, validating its adaptive and efficient mechanism.

Conclusion: Blink improves visual and multimodal understanding in MLLMs by emulating a human-inspired dynamic attention strategy, balancing exploration and focus efficiently.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GETok, a method for improving object grounding in 2D space within multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enhancing their spatial reasoning and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of MLLMs in grounding objects in 2D spatial space due to the autoregressive tokenization process.

Method: The proposed method, GETok, uses a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens including grid tokens and offset tokens for better spatial representation and localization refinement in MLLMs.

Result: GETok outperforms state-of-the-art methods in referring tasks under both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: GETok effectively embeds spatial relationships into tokens, improving MLLMs’ 2D reasoning capabilities without altering their architecture.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Few-Shot Prototypical Network adapted for skeleton-based encoders to address challenges of data scarcity in sign language recognition (ISLR). It integrates episodic training and a multi-scale temporal aggregation module, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world by overcoming challenges posed by the scarcity of sign language data and long-tail distribution in ISLR.

Method: A Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework with a skeleton-based encoder, Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN), and Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to learn a semantic metric space for dynamic class prototypes.

Result: Experimental results show 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the WLASL dataset, outperforming standard classifiers by over 13%. It also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization on the unseen SignASL dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed prototypical network approach overcomes standard classification drawbacks in data-scarce ISLR, achieving scalable sign language recognition even with limited examples and unseen datasets.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

*Pius Horn,Janis Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmarking framework for evaluating mathematical formula parsing from PDFs, using synthetically generated datasets and leveraging large language models for semantic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of semantically-aware evaluation benchmarks for parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs, which is essential for both training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases.

Method: The authors develop a benchmarking framework with synthetic PDFs providing precise LaTeX ground truth, utilize LLM as a judge for semantic formula evaluation, and create a two-stage matching pipeline for handling parser inconsistencies.

Result: Human validation demonstrates that LLM-based evaluation outperforms other metrics by correlating more strongly with human judgments (Pearson r=0.78). Analysis of over 20 PDF parsers on synthetic datasets highlights significant performance differences.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and reliable method for evaluating PDF formula extraction, aiding practitioners in selecting parsers for downstream applications and improving reproducibility in evaluation. Code and data have been made publicly available.

Abstract: Correctly parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs is critical for training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases from academic literature, yet existing benchmarks either exclude formulas entirely or lack semantically-aware evaluation metrics. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video editing lack effective audio-visual synchronization and precise spatial-temporal control needed for high-quality content creation.

Method: AVI-Edit refines user-provided masks iteratively for precise instance-level spatial edits and employs a self-feedback audio agent for fine-grained temporal synchronization. A large-scale dataset with detailed annotations is also constructed.

Result: Experimental evaluations show AVI-Edit surpasses existing methods in visual quality, alignment with conditions, and maintaining audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: AVI-Edit provides innovative tools for achieving granular instance editing and robust audio-visual synchronization, advancing the video editing field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation highlight that realistic audio-visual synchronization is crucial for engaging content creation. However, existing video editing methods largely overlook audio-visual synchronization and lack the fine-grained spatial and temporal controllability required for precise instance-level edits. In this paper, we propose AVI-Edit, a framework for audio-sync video instance editing. We propose a granularity-aware mask refiner that iteratively refines coarse user-provided masks into precise instance-level regions. We further design a self-feedback audio agent to curate high-quality audio guidance, providing fine-grained temporal control. To facilitate this task, we additionally construct a large-scale dataset with instance-centric correspondence and comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVI-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, condition following, and audio-visual synchronization.

### [150] [Unleashing Degradation-Carrying Features in Symmetric U-Net: Simpler and Stronger Baselines for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10581)
*Wenlong Jiao,Heyang Lee,Ping Wang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Dongwei Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two simplified architectures for all-in-one image restoration, SymUNet and SE-SymUNet, that outperform existing approaches while lowering computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration models rely heavily on complex architectures and elaborate strategies, motivating a simpler yet effective alternative.

Method: The paper proposes SymUNet, a symmetric U-Net architecture that aligns feature scales and uses additive fusion in skip connections. SE-SymUNet further integrates semantic features using cross-attention from frozen CLIP features.

Result: Both SymUNet and SE-SymUNet achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed methods set a simpler and stronger foundation for future advancements in the field of image restoration.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

*Quan Chen,Xiaokai Yang,Tingyu Wang,Rongfeng Lu,Xichun Sheng,Yaoqi Sun,Chenggang Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Salient Object Detection (SOD) framework optimized for weather-induced noise using a specific encoder and a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM), showing improved segmentation accuracy under complex weather scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods assume low-noise conditions and fail to address weather-induced noise, which degrades segmentation accuracy in real-world settings.

Method: The framework utilizes a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. It introduces a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM) using semantic features and a one-hot vector noise indicator to embed weather-aware priors. The encoder is compatible with mainstream decoders.

Result: Experiments on the WXSOD dataset demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy in complex weather conditions with the NIFM-enhanced encoder. Testing included multiple training data scales, encoder setups, and decoder configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and NIFM improve generalization and segmentation accuracy for SOD tasks under diverse and challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

*J. Xiao,Y. Guo,X. Zi,K. Thiyagarajan,C. Moreira,M. Prasad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study highlights a training-free method for enhancing semantic retrieval of remote sensing images using structured captions, outperforming existing supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the semantic gap in remote sensing image retrieval without relying on costly domain-specific training, and to introduce benchmarks evaluating VLM utility in zero-shot retrieval.

Method: The authors propose a fully training-free text-only approach called TRSLLaVA, leveraging text-to-text matching by using structured captions generated by VLMs in a unified textual embedding space.

Result: Experiments validate the method's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in recall rates compared to zero-shot and supervised models.

Conclusion: Structured text descriptions enable competitive and cost-effective retrieval in remote sensing, providing a viable alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of video understanding in challenging conditions like occlusion and rapid movement by focusing on motion dynamics instead of static appearance.

Method: The paper introduces TCAM, a system that uses a motion-field attention mechanism and unified training combining global video-text alignment and fine-grained spatial correspondence to identify and describe motion activities in videos without requiring user queries.

Result: TCAM achieves strong performance on the MeViS benchmark, with 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and high precision in discovering relevant expressions per video.

Conclusion: TCAM effectively demonstrates the potential of motion-centric frameworks in automated video understanding, enabling robust action recognition and description in complex scenarios.

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries. Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: Lang2Motion effectively generates trajectories for objects using language guidance, exceeding prior benchmarks and supporting advanced functionalities like style transfer, semantic interpolation, and representation editing.

Abstract: We present Lang2Motion, a framework for language-guided point trajectory generation by aligning motion manifolds with joint embedding spaces. Unlike prior work focusing on human motion or video synthesis, we generate explicit trajectories for arbitrary objects using motion extracted from real-world videos via point tracking. Our transformer-based auto-encoder learns trajectory representations through dual supervision: textual motion descriptions and rendered trajectory visualizations, both mapped through CLIP's frozen encoders. Lang2Motion achieves 34.2% Recall@1 on text-to-trajectory retrieval, outperforming video-based methods by 12.5 points, and improves motion accuracy by 33-52% (12.4 ADE vs 18.3-25.3) compared to video generation baselines. We demonstrate 88.3% Top-1 accuracy on human action recognition despite training only on diverse object motions, showing effective transfer across motion domains. Lang2Motion supports style transfer, semantic interpolation, and latent-space editing through CLIP-aligned trajectory representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOCR-Inspector introduces a method for assessing document parsing quality by detecting and analyzing fine-grained errors using pre-trained vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in achieving reliable, high-quality document parsing assessments, especially in real-world scenarios where standard benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate systems.

Method: DOCR-Inspector leverages a VLM-as-a-Judge approach, combined with a large training dataset (DOCRcase-200K) and a Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm for error detection and hierarchical parsing quality assessment.

Result: DOCR-Inspector-7B demonstrates superior performance compared to commercial and leading open-source models on the DOCRcaseBench, effectively enabling document parsing improvements and quality refinement.

Conclusion: DOCR-Inspector sets a new standard for document parsing evaluation and improvement, serving as both an effective tool for assessment and a mechanism to enhance parsing systems at scale.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale. Model and code are released at: https://github.com/ZZZZZQT/DOCR-Inspector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in deploying accurate deep-learning-based video tracking on edge devices with limited resources.

Method: Introduced K-Track, a framework combining sparse keyframe updates from deep learning with Kalman filtering for intermediate frame predictions, utilizing Bayesian uncertainty propagation.

Result: K-Track achieved 5-10x speedup while retaining over 85% accuracy across state-of-the-art trackers, demonstrating real-time performance on devices like NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

Conclusion: K-Track effectively bridges the gap between high-quality tracking algorithms and practical deployment in resource-limited environments by significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Point tracking in video sequences is a foundational capability for real-world computer vision applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, augmented reality, and video analysis. While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing risks associated with realistic DeepFake media, including threats to security, communication, and public trust.

Method: The TriDF benchmark evaluates three aspects: perception of manipulation artifacts, detection ability across forgery types, and the reliability of model-generated explanations.

Result: Experiments show the importance of perception for detection accuracy and reveal how unreliable explanations (hallucinations) can undermine decision-making.

Conclusion: TriDF offers a comprehensive framework for assessing and improving DeepFake detection systems, contributing to the development of trustworthy solutions to combat synthetic media threats.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have made it increasingly easy to fabricate realistic portrayals of individuals, creating serious risks for security, communication, and public trust. Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.

Result: NaviHydra demonstrates significant advancement, outperforming baselines in the NAVSIM benchmark for autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: The model offers improved controllability and navigation safety, representing a robust solution to dynamic autonomous driving challenges.

Abstract: The complexity of autonomous driving scenarios requires robust models that can interpret high-level navigation commands and generate safe trajectories. While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results in the NAVSIM benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of large-scale, real-world data required for estimating internal physical properties such as volumetric density, crucial for applications like robotics and simulation.

Method: Development of XDen-1K, a multi-modal dataset with 1000 objects and associated high-resolution 3D models as well as biplanar X-ray scans; introduction of an optimization framework for recovering volumetric density fields using sparse X-ray views; integration of X-ray data with segmentation networks.

Result: The dataset and framework improve accuracy in predicting center of mass and enhance the success rate in robotic manipulation. It showcases notable performance for volumetric segmentation and downstream embodied AI tasks.

Conclusion: XDen-1K provides a groundbreaking resource and benchmark, fostering advancements in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

TL;DR: Geo6DPose is a training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D object pose estimation designed for local, energy-efficient, and real-time robotic deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many current zero-shot 6D object pose estimation methods rely on large-scale models and cloud-based inference, which can cause high latency, energy consumption, and connectivity-related risks, making them impractical for real-world robotics with limited compute resources.

Method: Geo6DPose leverages lightweight, local computation using template DINO descriptors, geometric filtering, and RANSAC for recovering object poses. The process includes computing similarity maps and projecting descriptors into 3D coordinate systems.

Result: Geo6DPose achieves 53.7 AR at 1.08 FPS on a single GPU, matching larger models' performance while ensuring sub-second inference and not requiring training or network connectivity.

Conclusion: Geo6DPose offers a practical, localized, and robust solution for zero-shot 6D pose estimation in robotics by ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and independence from cloud-based resources.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

Result: Their new loss function and architecture outperform state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with moderate and high emitter densities, as demonstrated on synthetic and biological data.

Conclusion: The approach enables more efficient SMLM with quicker acquisition times, improving capabilities for live-cell imaging and achieving super-resolved imaging under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) allows reconstructing biology-relevant structures beyond the diffraction limit by detecting and localizing individual fluorophores -- fluorescent molecules stained onto the observed specimen -- over time to reconstruct super-resolved images. Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, we propose an iterative neural network that integrates knowledge of the microscope's optical system inside our model. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data show that both our new loss function and architecture surpass the state of the art at moderate and high emitter densities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to create high-quality photorealistic views from a single image efficiently and with robust performance across different datasets.

Method: SHARP uses a 3D Gaussian representation generated via a single neural network pass to synthesize views from a single image in less than a second.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly reducing LPIPS and DISTS errors, and cuts synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: SHARP is a highly efficient and effective approach for photorealistic view synthesis with robust generalization, leading to advances in computational photography.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

*Matias Cosarinsky,Nicolas Gaggion,Rodrigo Echeveste,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation in medical imaging, particularly chest X-rays, and introduces new methods to assess and utilize uncertainties for safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation with reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for safe clinical applications in medical imaging, ensuring human oversight by identifying unreliable and out-of-distribution predictions.

Method: The paper employs hybrid neural network architectures with convolutional encoders and graph-based generative decoders to derive two uncertainty measures: latent uncertainty (from distribution parameters) and predictive uncertainty (from stochastic output sampling).

Result: The study shows that the proposed uncertainty measures respond appropriately to controlled perturbations, help identify unreliable predictions, and detect out-of-distribution samples. A large dataset, CheXmask-U, with uncertainty annotations is also released.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation enhances landmark-based segmentation robustness and clinical safety. The provided dataset and tools promote future research in this area.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.

TL;DR: SpaceDrive improves VLM-based autonomous driving by integrating 3D spatial positional encodings for enhanced spatial understanding and trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving have limited capability to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships, which is crucial for effective interaction with the physical world.

Method: SpaceDrive incorporates 3D spatial positional encodings derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts, augmenting 2D visual tokens and enabling direct trajectory coordinate regression for improved spatial reasoning.

Result: SpaceDrive demonstrates state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and secures the second-best Driving Score (78.02) on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark among VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: SpaceDrive enhances spatial reasoning and planning accuracy in autonomous driving by effectively integrating semantic and 3D spatial representations using a universal positional encoding mechanism.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth estimation methods face challenges with temporal inconsistencies or real-time computational inefficiency, limiting utility in practical applications.

Method: VeloDepth integrates a unique Propagation Module using flow warping and residual corrections while enforcing structural temporal consistency for improved efficiency and accuracy.

Result: VeloDepth achieves state-of-the-art temporal consistency, competitive accuracy, and faster inference compared to existing methods, as demonstrated across several benchmarks.

Conclusion: VeloDepth provides a robust, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time video depth estimation, suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Motivation: To unify motion understanding and generation by enabling interactive feedback between these tasks through assessment and refinement mechanisms.

Method: Proposes IRMoGen, a novel iterative text-motion dialogue paradigm and develops IRG-MotionLLM with a three-stage training scheme, leveraging a data engine to create interleaved reasoning annotations.

Result: The model improves text-motion alignment, enhances generation performance through interleaved reasoning, and surpasses baseline models on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating motion assessment and refinement enables better interaction between understanding and generation tasks, resulting in significant performance improvements in motion generation systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness. Code & Data: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/IRG-MotionLLM/tree/main.

Conclusion: The proposed LDP framework offers a scalable and clinically applicable solution for high-quality colonoscopic diagnostic reporting, validated on multiple datasets for robustness.

Abstract: Colonoscopic polyp diagnosis is pivotal for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional automated reporting suffers from inconsistencies and hallucinations due to the scarcity of high-quality multimodal medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose LDP, a novel framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for professional polyp diagnosis report generation. Specifically, we curate MMEndo, a multimodal endoscopic dataset comprising expert-annotated colonoscopy image-text pairs. We fine-tune the Qwen2-VL-7B backbone using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) and align it with clinical standards via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments show that our LDP outperforms existing baselines on both automated metrics and rigorous clinical expert evaluations (achieving a Physician Score of 7.2/10), significantly reducing training computational costs by 833x compared to full fine-tuning. The proposed solution offers a scalable, clinically viable path for primary healthcare, with additional validation on the IU-XRay dataset confirming its robustness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline and a diffusion-based AI model to predict coronary blood pressure efficiently, bypassing traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for simulating coronary blood flow using CFD are computationally heavy, time-intensive, and not suitable for large-scale clinical application, limiting access to reliable hemodynamic training data for AI models.

Method: The authors develop an automated pipeline for coronary geometry extraction and data generation while introducing a diffusion-based regression model that predicts blood pressure from CT angiography features, eliminating the need for CFD processing during inference.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with metrics including an R2 of 64.42%, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The work presents a scalable framework for non-invasive and rapid prediction of coronary blood pressure, facilitating broader accessibility for CAD diagnosis.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GLAT with IRM to address challenges in prostate cancer WSI grading by enhancing feature learning and spatial consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prostate cancer grading on WSIs by addressing challenges like large-scale data, heterogeneous tissue structures, and ineffective patch selection.

Method: Introduces GLAT (Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer) and IRM (Iterative Refinement Module) for refined patch selection, graph modeling for tissue connectivity, and robust WSI-level representation.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance, spatial consistency, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on public and private datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GLAT with IRM enhances prostate cancer WSI grading, providing an efficient and accurate solution to current challenges.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Wang Lu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issues of data distribution shift and label noise, proposing the Self-Ensemble Post Learning (SEPL) method to improve domain generalization robustness even under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges of domain generalization and robustness in machine learning and computer vision models, particularly under conditions of data distribution shift and label noise, which result in diminished model performance.

Method: The proposed method, SEPL, involves feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It trains probing classifiers on diverse intermediate features within a pre-trained model and integrates their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach to mitigate noise effects.

Result: The method improves robustness against noisy labels and data shifts, as experimentally shown, proving effective in leveraging diverse latent model features and showing potential across real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: SEPL demonstrates that leveraging intermediate features and ensemble predictions can counteract label noise and spurious features, thus enhancing the robustness of domain generalization methods in practical settings.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Motivation: To tackle the challenge of 6D object pose estimation for unseen objects and avoid reliance on explicit feature matching methods.

Method: PoseGAM predicts object pose using a multi-view framework with both explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. It is supported by a synthetic dataset with diverse environmental conditions.

Result: PoseGAM demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average AR improvement of 5.1% across benchmarks and up to 17.6% gains on specific datasets.

Conclusion: The framework shows robustness and generalization for unseen objects, advancing the field of 6D object pose estimation.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWiT-4D is a novel framework for converting monocular videos into high-quality 4D animated meshes, utilizing a Sliding-Window Transformer and Diffusion Transformer integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular video to 4D mesh generation faces challenges due to the lack of large-scale, naturally captured 4D datasets and the difficulty of training generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch. There is an opportunity to leverage advances in image-to-3D generation to address these limitations.

Method: Introducing SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer that integrates with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator. It adds temporal modeling across video frames, keeping spatial data intact. The approach includes an optimization-based trajectory module for recovering global translations in static-camera setups.

Result: SWiT-4D requires minimal 4D supervision, achieving high-fidelity geometry and temporal consistency after fine-tuning with a single short video. The results outperform baselines in temporal smoothness on multiple datasets, including zoo-test sets, C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: SWiT-4D demonstrates practical deployability, effectively transforming monocular videos into temporally consistent, high-quality 4D meshes under limited data conditions. Its strong performance highlights its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSI-Video-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs, revealing significant gaps between AI and human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a holistic benchmark for assessing spatial intelligence in MLLMs, essential for their evolution into general-purpose assistants in physical environments.

Method: Developed MMSI-Video-Bench with 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 video clips. It uses four levels (Perception, Planning, Prediction, Cross-Video Reasoning) and includes three sub-benchmarks, with human-annotated data and expert review.

Result: Tested 25 MLLMs, showing many perform near chance level, and the best reasoning models still underperform humans by nearly 60%. Notably, spatially fine-tuned models fail to generalize effectively.

Conclusion: The benchmark exposes key failures in current MLLMs (e.g., geometric reasoning, motion grounding) and suggests the need for significant advances in addressing video-based reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

Method: Developed MiSI-Bench, a benchmark with 163,000 QA pairs and 587,000 images from 4,000 molecular structures for testing nine diverse tasks related to microscopic spatial reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs lag behind humans overall but a fine-tuned 7B model exceeded humans in specific spatial tasks; however, it lacks in scientifically-grounded performance.

Conclusion: Explicit integration of domain knowledge into VLMs is crucial to achieving scientific AGI and improving their microscopic spatial reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI), the capability to perceive and reason about the spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery. To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

Result: The system produces high-quality skeletal animations and effective cross-species motion retargeting, validated through experiments in different scenarios.

Conclusion: MoCapAnything enables scalable and efficient motion capture that supports arbitrary 3D assets, bridging the gap between monocular videos and diverse content creation workflows.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

*Brandon Smock,Valerie Faucon-Morin,Max Sokolov,Libin Liang,Tayyibah Khanam,Maury Courtland*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PubTables-v2, a comprehensive dataset for table extraction tasks, and presents POTATR, a model leveraging this dataset for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenges in table extraction tasks, especially with the limitations in annotated data and the need for models that can recognize tables in full document contexts.

Method: The authors created and utilized PubTables-v2, a large-scale table extraction dataset, and developed the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph model for page-level table extraction.

Result: PubTables-v2 proved effective as a new benchmark for multi-page table extraction tasks, and POTATR demonstrates progress in enhancing table extraction capabilities using domain-specialized vision-language models.

Conclusion: PubTables-v2 provides a valuable resource for advancing table extraction research, and the introduction of POTATR shows potential for comprehensive table structure recognition in visual documents.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

TL;DR: DuetSVG enhances SVG generation by introducing a multimodal model that jointly produces visual and SVG tokens, improving decoding quality and visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing VLMs that struggle with complex semantics and lack visual signals during decoding, impacting SVG generation quality.

Method: Developed DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model trained on image and SVG datasets, alongside a novel test-time scaling strategy leveraging visual predictions during SVG decoding.

Result: DuetSVG outperforms previous methods by generating visually accurate, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs.

Conclusion: DuetSVG's end-to-end multimodal approach and test-time scaling enhance SVG generation capabilities, enabling faithful and coherent visual outputs.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion benchmarks face challenges due to the lack of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets, and manual annotation of motion datasets is costly and limits scalability.

Method: An automated pipeline detects and tracks objects in videos to extract trajectories. Large Language Models are used to generate fine-grained captions and diverse motion-related QA pairs.

Result: Models fine-tuned with datasets from FoundationMotion achieved significant improvements in motion understanding and spatial reasoning, outperforming open-source and closed-source baselines.

Conclusion: FoundationMotion offers a scalable, effective solution for creating motion datasets, enhancing model fine-tuning for better motion understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: BabyVLM-V2 is a framework inspired by infant development, designed for sample-efficient vision-language model pretraining. It includes a longitudinal audiovisual corpus and the DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to create a vision-language model training method that mimics infant developmental experiences to improve efficiency and effectiveness in pretraining.

Method: The approach uses a longitudinal infant-centric audiovisual dataset (videos, images, and conversational data) along with a new cognitive evaluation benchmark suite, DevCV Toolbox, with multimodal tasks reflecting early child developmental capabilities.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the BabyVLM-V2 model, though compact, achieves competitive performance and even outperforms sophisticated systems like GPT-4o on specific tasks.

Conclusion: BabyVLM-V2 provides a structured, developmentally grounded approach for vision-language model training, offering promising outcomes and encouraging further research in this area.

Abstract: Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for real-time, temporally consistent talking head avatars utilizing Gaussian Splatting driven by 3D models and audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for speech-driven talking heads either lack temporal stability or realism, limiting their practical applications.

Method: A transformer-based prediction of 3D Morphable Models' parameters from audio input is used, combined with Gaussian Splatting for avatar generation.

Result: The approach achieves real-time talking head generation with competitive visual fidelity and temporal consistency using monocular video and audio inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves real-world applications of talking head avatars by balancing temporal stability, real-time performance, and visual accuracy.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

TL;DR: OmniView is a unified framework for 4D consistency tasks that combines space, time, and view conditions, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address fragmented approaches to injecting camera control into diffusion models, which are trained on narrow slices of 3D/4D data. OmniView aims to unify these tasks under one framework.

Method: OmniView introduces a representation that separates space, time, and view conditions, enabling versatile combinations for various 4D tasks like novel view synthesis, trajectory extrapolation, and text/image-to-video creation.

Result: OmniView yields state-of-the-art performance across tasks, improving quality metrics by up to 60% in dynamic benchmarks, 33% in multiview tasks, and 4x reduction in trajectory errors in text-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: OmniView's generalist approach demonstrates the feasibility of a single model handling diverse 4D consistency tasks effectively, outperforming specialized models.

Abstract: Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model. Project page is available at https://snap-research.github.io/OmniView/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mull-Tokens, a modality-agnostic approach to enhance multimodal reasoning tasks, achieving improved performance over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in multimodal reasoning models, which struggle with scalability and rely on handcrafted methods for reasoning across text and images.

Method: The paper introduces Mull-Tokens – pre-trained latent tokens adaptable to text and image modalities. This involves supervised training from interleaved text-image inputs, followed by unsupervised fine-tuning using final answers.

Result: Mull-Tokens demonstrate significant improvements across four spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a +16% enhancement on tasks like puzzle solving compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Mull-Tokens offer an effective, scalable solution for abstract reasoning in multimodal contexts, advancing research in grounding textual and visual reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.

TL;DR: VL-JEPA is a novel vision-language model that improves upon classical models in efficiency and performance by predicting embeddings instead of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient vision-language model that focuses on semantic understanding while reducing the computational and parameter overhead of traditional approaches.

Method: VL-JEPA uses a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture to predict continuous embeddings of target texts instead of generating tokens autogressively. It requires fewer trainable parameters and invokes a lightweight text decoder only when necessary.

Result: VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance with 50% fewer trainable parameters compared to standard token-space VLMs. It supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and VQA tasks, outperforming or matching existing models in multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: VL-JEPA demonstrates that embedding-based prediction can result in both computational efficiency and robust performance, making it a strong candidate for vision-language applications.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AlcheMinT, a framework for subject-driven video generation with explicit temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limited fine-grained temporal control in subject-driven video generation, which limits applications like storyboarding and animation.

Method: AlcheMinT integrates a positional encoding mechanism for timestamps and subject identities into existing video generation models, alongside text tokens to strengthen subject-identity association.

Result: AlcheMinT enables precise temporal control in video generation for multiple subjects while maintaining visual quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AlcheMinT provides a novel solution for compositional video synthesis with enhanced temporal and subject control, advancing video generation technology.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

Method: Develop the MeViS dataset with annotated motion-based expressions in text and audio, and benchmark existing methods across multiple video segmentation tasks. Propose a novel model, LMPM++, to tackle these tasks effectively.

Result: The dataset, MeViS, supports 33,072 motion expression annotations, allowing evaluation of existing methods and revealing their weaknesses. The proposed model, LMPM++, achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MeViS facilitates advancements in motion expression-guided video understanding, emphasizing the importance of motion-related tasks and providing resources and benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational bottlenecks in processing high-volume multi-camera data for autonomous driving.

Method: Flex uses learnable scene tokens to encode information from multiple cameras and timesteps, without relying on explicit 3D inductive biases.

Result: Flex improves inference throughput by 2.2x and significantly enhances driving performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach challenges 3D priors, proving a data-driven encoding strategy to be more efficient and scalable for future systems.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ClusIR, a novel image restoration framework that addresses diverse degradations by explicitly modeling degradation semantics and using cluster-guided adaptive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image restoration for diverse and complex degradations, as current methods struggle to adapt restoration behavior and fail to explicitly model degradation types.

Method: ClusIR introduces learnable clustering for degradation semantics and employs two key components: PCGRM for distinguishing degradations and expert activation, and DAFMM for frequency-based adaptive modulation.

Result: ClusIR demonstrates competitive restoration performance across various image benchmarks with its innovative cluster-guided restoration strategy.

Conclusion: ClusIR effectively bridges spatial and frequency domains using cluster-guided cues, offering superior restoration for diverse image degradation scenarios.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

TL;DR: E-RayZer is a new self-supervised model for 3D-aware visual pre-training, outperforming previous methods like RayZer and even some supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration in self-supervised pre-training for 3D representations, specifically from multi-view images.

Method: E-RayZer performs self-supervised 3D reconstruction with explicit geometry rather than relying on latent-space synthesis, utilizing a novel fine-grained learning curriculum.

Result: The model outperforms previous methods in pose estimation, competes with supervised reconstruction methods, and excels in 3D downstream tasks.

Conclusion: E-RayZer sets a new standard for 3D-awareness in visual pre-training, showing that self-supervised learning directly in 3D space eliminates shortcuts and improves task performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group Diffusion, allowing joint denoising of images during inference via shared cross-image attention, resulting in improved image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore how collaborative image generation using shared attention mechanisms can improve the quality of outputs in diffusion models, moving beyond independent sample generation.

Method: They propose Group Diffusion, an approach that extends the attention mechanism to span multiple images, enabling joint denoising and inter-image correspondence learning during inference.

Result: Group Diffusion achieves significant improvements, including up to a 32.2% FID reduction on ImageNet-256x256, with stronger generation quality observed in larger group sizes.

Conclusion: The study highlights cross-sample inference as a previously untapped and effective mechanism for enhancing generative modeling, opening new avenues for improving diffusion models.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

*Tsai-Shien Chen,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang,Egor Nemchinov,Moayed Haji-Ali,Riza Alp Guler,Willi Menapace,Ivan Skorokhodov,Anil Kag,Jun-Yan Zhu,Sergey Tulyakov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omni-Attribute, an open-vocabulary image attribute encoder that creates high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations for better attribute transfer and image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual concept personalization rely on holistic embeddings, which entangle various visual attributes and lead to information leakage and incoherent results. There is a need for isolated, high-precision attribute-specific representations.

Method: The authors curate semantically linked image pairs with positive and negative attribute annotations and propose a dual-objective training approach. This technique balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement to learn specific attribute-driven embeddings.

Result: Omni-Attribute achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, as tested across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute effectively addresses the challenge of isolating and transferring specific visual attributes, offering significant improvements in fidelity, control, and compositional generation tasks.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

*Wentao Zhou,Xuweiyi Chen,Vignesh Rajagopal,Jeffrey Chen,Rohan Chandra,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StereoWalker, enhancing robot navigation models with stereo inputs and mid-level vision for efficient performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation models ignore mid-level vision and rely solely on monocular input, which struggles with geometric and dynamic challenges, requiring excessive training data.

Method: StereoWalker incorporates stereo vision and explicitly integrates mid-level vision modules like depth estimation and dense pixel tracking.

Result: StereoWalker achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with 1.5% of training data and exceeds state-of-the-art performance with full training data.

Conclusion: Augmenting navigation models with stereo inputs and mid-level vision improves efficiency and accuracy in dynamic and unstructured environments.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

*Yukai Shi,Weiyu Li,Zihao Wang,Hongyang Li,Xingyu Chen,Ping Tan,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneMaker, a decoupled 3D scene generation framework to tackle challenges in open-set occlusion and pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing 3D scene generation methods that struggle with high-quality geometry and pose accuracy under severe occlusion and open-set settings.

Method: The framework decouples de-occlusion modeling from 3D object generation, enhances it using diverse image datasets, proposes a unified global-local attention pose estimation model, and introduces a novel open-set 3D scene dataset.

Result: SceneMaker demonstrates superior performance in indoor and open-set scenes, validated through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: SceneMaker effectively addresses the challenges of previous methods, offering improved de-occlusion, pose estimation, and generalization in 3D scene generation. The codes and datasets are made publicly available.

Abstract: We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces WorldLens, a benchmark to evaluate generative world models' ability to preserve geometry, obey physics, and support reliable control. It highlights the shortcomings of current models and provides tools like a human-annotated dataset and an evaluation model for fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of generative world models lacks a unified system to evaluate whether generated driving environments adhere to geometry, physics, and behavior requirements. The absence of such a system hinders progress in embodied AI.

Method: The authors propose WorldLens, a comprehensive benchmark with five evaluation dimensions: Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference. They also introduce the WorldLens-26K dataset of human-annotated videos and develop the WorldLens-Agent evaluation model based on these annotations.

Result: WorldLens captures gaps in existing world models, revealing trade-offs between visual realism, physical plausibility, and behavioral fidelity. It provides a robust framework for aligning objective metrics with human judgment.

Conclusion: WorldLens, along with its dataset and evaluation model, establishes a standardized approach for assessing generative world models. It allows for evaluations reflecting not only visual realism but also true functional reliability, paving the way for future improvements in embodied AI.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

*Tjark Behrens,Anton Obukhov,Bingxin Ke,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoSpace introduces viewpoint-conditioned diffusion for monocular-to-stereo synthesis, modeling without explicit depth or warping, achieving high geometric consistency and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable methods in stereo synthesis that do not rely on explicit depth estimation or warping techniques.

Method: StereoSpace uses diffusion models conditioned purely on viewpoint. It operates within a canonical rectified space to ensure correspondences and handle disocclusions end-to-end.

Result: StereoSpace outperforms existing approaches across metrics reflecting perceptual comfort (iSQoE) and geometric consistency (MEt3R), demonstrating robust performance on diverse scenes.

Conclusion: The viewpoint-conditioned diffusion framework presents a scalable and efficient alternative for stereo generation, eliminating the need for depth estimation or warping.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC4907 NFTs are limited by their single-user, single-time-slot authorization, restricting their use in decentralized scheduling scenarios.

Method: M-ERC4907 introduces functionalities for batch configuration of multiple time slots and simultaneous authorization of multiple users.

Result: Experiments on the Remix platform demonstrate reduced on-chain transactions and lower Gas consumption with M-ERC4907.

Conclusion: M-ERC4907 enhances ERC4907 by improving scalability and resource allocation through multi-user, multi-slot authorization capabilities.

Abstract: The ERC4907 standard enables rentable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) but is limited to single-user, single-time-slot authorization, which severely limits its applicability and efficiency in decentralized multi-slot scheduling scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Multi-slot ERC4907 (M-ERC4907) extension method. The M-ERC4907 method introduces novel functionalities to support the batch configuration of multiple time slots and simultaneous authorization of multiple users, thereby effectively eliminating the rigid sequential authorization constraint of ERC4907. The experiment was conducted on the Remix development platform. Experimental results show that the M-ERC4907 method significantly reduces on-chain transactions and overall Gas consumption, leading to enhanced scalability and resource allocation efficiency.

### [197] [Design Space Exploration of DMA based Finer-Grain Compute Communication Overlap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10236)
*Shagnik Pal,Shaizeen Aga,Suchita Pati,Mahzabeen Islam,Lizy K. John*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Introduces FiCCO, a finer-grain compute-communication overlap technique, addressing inefficiencies in distributed ML systems to achieve up to 1.6x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models require distributed training/inference which exposes communication inefficiencies. Current techniques focus on shard-level overlap but lack finer-grain optimization, leaving performance gains untapped.

Method: Develop FiCCO, analyze operation-level inefficiencies, design scheduling heuristics based on inefficiency signatures, and offload communication to GPU DMA engines to optimize distributed ML execution.

Result: FiCCO schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup in ML deployments with 81% heuristic accuracy for unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: Adopting finer-grain compute-communication overlap optimizes distributed ML system, providing significant performance improvements over shard-level techniques.

Abstract: As both ML training and inference are increasingly distributed, parallelization techniques that shard (divide) ML model across GPUs of a distributed system, are often deployed. With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios.

TL;DR: The authors introduce ELANA, an open-source profiling tool for evaluating large language models' latency and power consumption on diverse hardware platforms, emphasizing optimization in model deployment and development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently serve and evaluate large language models across various hardware platforms, coupled with the critical role of benchmarking in optimizing deployment and development, inspired this work.

Method: The authors developed ELANA, a lightweight, open-source tool compatible with Hugging Face APIs, supporting profiling of LLM parameters like latency, cache size, and energy consumption across multi-GPU and edge GPU setups.

Result: ELANA successfully profiles model properties such as latency and energy consumption, supports integration with Hugging Face models, and is suitable for research on efficient LLMs and proof-of-concept studies.

Conclusion: ELANA addresses the challenges of latency and energy profiling for LLMs, making it accessible for academic research and practical optimizations in hardware utilization.

Abstract: The latency and power consumption of large language models (LLMs) are major constraints when serving them across a wide spectrum of hardware platforms, from mobile edge devices to cloud GPU clusters. Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies. We release the ELANA profiling tool at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Elana.

*Bethel Hall,Owen Ungaro,William Eiers*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces CloudFix, a novel framework combining formal methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the repair of access control policies in cloud environments, improving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in manual updating and debugging of cloud access control policies, which can be error-prone, time-consuming, and create security risks, while exploring the underutilized potential of LLMs in this domain.

Method: CloudFix uses Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to spot errors in policies and incorporates LLMs for repair generation. These repairs are then validated with SMT solvers. A dataset of AWS policies from forum posts was curated and augmented to test the approach.

Result: CloudFix outperforms a baseline in repair accuracy across varying request sizes in the curated and augmented AWS policy dataset.

Conclusion: CloudFix demonstrates the potential of combining formal methods and LLMs for automated repair of cloud access control policies, setting a foundation for more secure, efficient policy management. The tool and dataset are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Access control policies are vital for securing modern cloud computing, where organizations must manage access to sensitive data across thousands of users in distributed system settings. Cloud administrators typically write and update policies manually, which can be an error-prone and time-consuming process and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches based on symbolic analysis have demonstrated success in automated debugging and repairing access control policies; however, their generalizability is limited in the context of cloud-based access control. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes. Our work is the first to leverage LLMs for policy repair, showcasing the effectiveness of LLMs for access control and enabling efficient and automated repair of cloud access control policies. We make our tool Cloudfix and AWS dataset publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper develops the TDC-Cache framework for decentralized caching in Web3.0, improving efficiency and security in redundant data replication and inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address efficiency and security challenges in decentralized data access within Web3.0 caused by redundant data replication and inconsistency.

Method: The authors propose the TDC-Cache framework featuring a two-layer architecture with Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) and Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC). They also introduce a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus for caching consistency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TDC-Cache reduces access latency by 20%, increases cache hit rate by 18%, and improves success consensus rate by 10% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This research provides a foundational study in decentralized caching for Web3.0, introducing efficient and resilient strategies for information access.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Web3.0 is transforming the Internet from a centralized structure to decentralized, which empowers users with unprecedented self-sovereignty over their own data. However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%. Overall, this paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of decentralized caching framework and strategy for Web3.0.

TL;DR: GOODSPEED is a framework to optimize speculative decoding in distributed LLM inference, balancing speed and fairness across servers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demand of LLMs creates challenges in real-time inference for multi-user servers and environments with limited resources.

Method: GOODSPEED uses a central verification server with adaptive speculative decoding and gradient scheduling for efficient task allocation.

Result: Rigorous analysis shows GOODSPEED achieves optimal goodput allocation, near-optimal performance, and bounded error under dynamic workloads.

Conclusion: GOODSPEED improves scalability, fairness, and efficiency for multi-server speculative decoding systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their high computational demands pose significant challenges for real-time inference, especially in multi-user server speculative decoding and resource-constrained environments. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads. These results demonstrate that GOODSPEED provides a scalable, fair and efficient solution for multi-server speculative decoding in distributed LLM inference systems.

TL;DR: RLTune is a reinforcement learning framework optimizing deep learning job scheduling on GPU clusters, improving efficiency and reducing delays without needing application-specific profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput, low-latency GPU scheduling in heterogeneous clusters is challenging due to application diversity and limitations in existing schedulers.

Method: RLTune combines reinforcement learning-based prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize scheduling objectives while using large-scale production traces for training.

Result: RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens job completion time by 70%, outperforming traditional scheduling approaches.

Conclusion: RLTune provides a scalable and generalizable solution for cloud providers, enabling efficient, fair, and sustainable management of diverse deep learning workloads.

Abstract: Modern cloud platforms increasingly host large-scale deep learning (DL) workloads, demanding high-throughput, low-latency GPU scheduling. However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.

*Fan Yu,Guodong Li,Si Wu,Weijun Fang,Sihuang Hu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of Locally Repairable Codes designed to address inefficiencies in existing coding for large-scale storage systems by enabling collaborative parity repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in current Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) for wide stripe storage systems, such as high repair costs, frequent expensive global repairs, and rapidly degrading reliability.

Method: The paper proposes embedding structured dependency between local and global parity blocks in a cascading fashion, developing repair algorithms, and creating practical implementations like CP-Azure and CP-Uniform.

Result: The proposed CP-LRC design reduced repair times by up to 41% for single-node failures and 26% for two-node failures, as validated via evaluations on Alibaba Cloud.

Conclusion: CP-LRCs ensure fault tolerance equivalent to MDS codes while reducing repair costs and enhancing efficiency, making them more effective for wide stripe storage systems.

Abstract: Erasure coding with wide stripes is increasingly adopted to reduce storage overhead in large-scale storage systems. However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform. Evaluations on Alibaba Cloud show reductions in repair time of up to 41% for single-node failures and 26% for two-node failures.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CFLHKD, an approach to Hierarchical Clustered Federated Learning that enhances local and global model accuracy while facilitating inter-cluster knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiencies of conventional CFL approaches in handling fragmented learning and leveraging collective cluster insights.

Method: Development of CFLHKD, which uses multi-teacher knowledge distillation and bi-level aggregation to improve knowledge sharing and model performance.

Result: CFLHKD achieves superior cluster-specific and global model accuracy, with a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57% on standard datasets.

Conclusion: Hierarchical CFL with CFLHKD overcomes the limitations of conventional CFL, enhancing both personalization and efficiency while addressing communication challenges.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing data heterogeneity and ensuring privacy in large distributed IoT environments. By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\%.

*Xinhang Chen,Chao Zhang,Jiahuan He,Wei Liu,Jianming Zhang,Wenlong Zhou,Xiao Li,Pai Zeng,Shiyong Li,Yuanpan Qian,Dong Li,Zhaogeng Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESS, an offload-centric system to enhance DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp by improving Decode-stage throughput via selective offloading of Latent-Cache to CPU memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the Decode-stage bottleneck in DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp caused by growing Latent-Cache requirements with sequence length and limited GPU memory, which reduces batch-size and processing efficiency.

Method: ESS offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while keeping latency-critical components on GPU, decoupling batch-size from GPU memory limitations and optimizing resource usage.

Result: ESS achieves 69.4% throughput improvement at 32K context lengths and up to 123% improvement at 128K context lengths in simulations, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ESS is a scalable and cost-effective solution for long-context inference in LLM serving, enhancing throughput and reducing deployment costs.

Abstract: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp introduces a sparse attention mechanism that significantly reduces inference latency in long-context scenarios. Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.
  To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.
  Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.

### [207] [BAMBO: Construct Ability and Efficiency LLM Pareto Set via Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09972)
*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Zhenqian Zhu,Yamin Hu,Yiya Xi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BAMBO, a new framework to construct Pareto sets for LLMs, overcoming limitations of existing merging techniques by reducing dimensionality effectively and optimizing block partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing Pareto set constructing methods for LLMs, which fail due to computational intractability or sparsity of solutions.

Method: The paper proposes BAMBO, featuring a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy using dynamic programming, formulated as a 1D clustering problem, with the process automated by a qEHVI-driven evolutionary loop.

Result: Experiments confirm BAMBO discovers a more expansive and higher-quality Pareto frontier compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: BAMBO effectively balances capability-efficiency trade-offs in LLMs by automating and optimizing Pareto set construction, enabling customizable model selection for varied constraints.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

### [208] [HGC-Herd: Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Condensation via Representative Node Herding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09947)
*Fuyan Ou,Siqi Ai,Yulin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGC-Herd, a training-free framework for efficiently condensing large heterogeneous graphs while preserving semantic and structural details, achieving high accuracy with less computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is limited due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features, and current graph condensation methods are computationally expensive on such graphs.

Method: HGC-Herd employs lightweight feature propagation for multi-hop relational context encoding and a class-wise herding mechanism to generate balanced, representative node subsets for heterogeneous graphs.

Result: Experiments on datasets like ACM, DBLP, and Freebase show that HGC-Herd achieves comparable or higher accuracy than training on full graphs, while significantly reducing runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: HGC-Herd demonstrates the potential for scalable and efficient representation learning on heterogeneous graphs, offering a practical tool for tasks requiring condensed graph computation.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.

### [209] [Latent Action World Models for Control with Unlabeled Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10016)
*Marvin Alles,Xingyuan Zhang,Patrick van der Smagt,Philip Becker-Ehmck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a latent-action world model that integrates action-conditioned and action-free data for efficient training of world models, reducing reliance on action-labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training world models traditionally relies on action-labeled data, which can be scarce and limits the ability to leverage large-scale unlabeled datasets effectively.

Method: The authors design a latent-action world model that learns a shared latent representation of actions and aligns them across action-conditioned and action-free data. They also integrate offline RL to utilize action-free data in policy learning.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite while using about ten times fewer action-labeled samples compared to traditional action-conditioned baselines.

Conclusion: Latent-action world models allow for efficient learning by leveraging both passive and interactive data, reducing dependency on action-labeled samples and enhancing the applicability of world models.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.

*Jan Marco Ruiz de Vargas,Kirtan Padh,Niki Kilbertus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cluster-DAGs as a framework to leverage prior knowledge for improving causal discovery, addressing challenges in high-dimensional and complex data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery methods struggle with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies, and incorporating prior knowledge can potentially improve their efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose Cluster-DAGs as a flexible prior knowledge framework and extend existing causal discovery algorithms by developing Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI for different observation settings.

Result: Simulation experiments show that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform baseline methods without prior knowledge in causal discovery tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework enhances causal discovery, particularly in high-dimensional and complex settings, proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

### [211] [Robust Gradient Descent via Heavy-Ball Momentum with Predictive Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10033)
*Sarwan Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HB-SGE is a robust acceleration method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation to ensure stability and adaptiveness on ill-conditioned and non-convex landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the divergence issues of accelerated gradient methods like NAG on ill-conditioned or non-convex problems while retaining their faster convergence on well-conditioned landscapes.

Method: HB-SGE integrates heavy-ball momentum with gradient extrapolation, relying on local Taylor approximations to estimate future gradient directions for adaptive acceleration and stability.

Result: HB-SGE converges robustly on ill-conditioned and non-convex problems where traditional methods like NAG and SGD fail, with numerical examples on quadratics and Rosenbrock functions showcasing its superior performance.

Conclusion: HB-SGE offers a stable and robust alternative to classical accelerated gradient methods, performing well across various landscapes with minimal memory overhead and no additional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

### [212] [Intelligently Weighting Multiple Reference Models for Direct Preference Optimization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10040)
*Skyler Wu,Aymen Echarghaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) to fine-tune large language models by introducing new strategies for setting reference model weights, and demonstrates that single-reference approaches can outperform multiple-reference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance of MRPO by addressing weaknesses in current reference weighting methods which are ad-hoc and statistically unsound.

Method: Four new weighting strategies are proposed: two offline methods using validation signals, a sliding-window online estimator to limit overfitting, and a Thompson Sampling approach treating reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit problem.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows all proposed strategies outperform existing MRPO methods, but single-reference Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) performs even better than multiple-reference approaches.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the efficacy of multiple-reference strategies and suggest single-reference fine-tuning may be more effective for aligning LLMs with human preferences in practice.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance unsupervised pre-training in reinforcement learning by optimizing state entropy without requiring task-specific rewards.

Method: SEMDICE algorithm computes the stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy directly using an arbitrary off-policy dataset.

Result: SEMDICE surpasses baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy and demonstrates superior adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SEMDICE offers a principled solution for unsupervised RL pre-training by directly optimizing policies for state entropy maximization, benefiting downstream tasks.

Abstract: In the unsupervised pre-training for reinforcement learning, the agent aims to learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without relying on task-specific reward functions. We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

*João Lucas Luz Lima Sarcinelli,Diego Furtado Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a three-step ensemble pipeline to improve zero-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Portuguese, combining local LLMs without fine-tuning, and outperforms individual models in most scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underperformance of LLMs in NER tasks, particularly for lower-resource languages like Portuguese, and explore ensemble methods as a solution for scalable and localized deployment.

Method: The paper proposes a three-step ensemble pipeline for NER, leveraging heuristics to optimally combine locally run open-weight LLMs, using minimal annotated data for calibration and evaluation.

Result: The proposed ensemble method outperformed individual models in 4 out of 5 Portuguese NER datasets and showed superior performance even in cross-dataset applications, reducing the requirement for annotated data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates an effective approach for NER using ensembles of LLMs, offering a scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot solution without fine-tuning, which is particularly beneficial for low-resource languages like Portuguese.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning but often under-perform in Named Entity Recognition (NER), especially for lower-resource languages like Portuguese. While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/Joao-Luz/local-llm-ner-ensemble.

*Zhuo-Yang Song,Qing-Hong Cao,Ming-xing Luo,Hua Xing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical approach based on the least action principle to investigate macroscopic generative dynamics of large language models used in agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a theoretical framework to understand and unify the macroscopic dynamics of large language model-driven agents, which is currently lacking but essential for scientific advancement.

Method: The authors experimentally measure transition probabilities between model-generated states and apply the least action principle to statistically infer LLMs' generative directionality and underlying potential functions.

Result: They discover a detailed balance in the generated transitions, suggesting LLMs inherently learn underlying potential functions independent of specific architectures or prompts.

Conclusion: This is a pioneering step toward a macroscopic dynamics theory for AI agents, aiming to transform AI systems' study into a predictable, quantifiable science.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

Motivation: To address the limitations of scalability and adaptability of Transformer architectures in time series forecasting due to their quadratic computational complexity.

Method: DB2-TransF replaces Transformer self-attention with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer to capture multi-scale local and global patterns efficiently.

Result: Experiments on 13 benchmarks show DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Transformers while using less memory.

Conclusion: DB2-TransF is a scalable and efficient approach for time series forecasting, presenting an advancement in addressing computational challenges.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a forecasting method, SoTra, to improve predictive control in safety-critical applications, addressing exposure bias with soft tokens and risk-aware decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses challenges in predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, particularly exposure bias in autoregressive forecasting leading to unstable predictions and risks in clinical settings.

Method: The proposed method, SoTra, uses soft tokens to propagate probability distributions to minimize exposure bias and incorporates a risk-aware decoding module focused on reducing expected clinical harm.

Result: In glucose forecasting, SoTra decreases average risk by 18%, and in blood-pressure forecasting, it reduces clinical risk by about 15%.

Conclusion: SoTra achieves significant risk reduction, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for safety-critical predictive control applications in healthcare.

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.

Result: Benchmarking Text2Graph on five datasets for zero-shot classification tasks, the study shows it provides competitive accuracy while significantly reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.

Conclusion: Text2Graph offers a sustainable, flexible, and competitive approach for zero-shot text classification, especially suited for energy-efficient large-scale annotation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present \textsc{Text2Graph}, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents MedXAI, an explainable framework that integrates deep learning with clinician-derived knowledge to improve medical imaging diagnosis, particularly under challenging conditions like domain shifts and rare-class scenarios. The framework enhances generalization, reduces rare-class bias, and provides interpretable diagnostic insights.


<details>

Motivation: Existing deep learning models face limitations in handling real-world distribution changes, rare medical conditions, and providing explainability in critical clinical applications. The need for accurate and interpretable AI solutions in medical imaging calls for a new approach.

Method: The authors propose MedXAI, a framework combining deep vision models with expert clinical knowledge. MedXAI localizes diagnostic features and prioritizes clinician-informed explanations over post-hoc interpretability methods like Saliency Maps and LIME. The approach integrates symbolic components as clinical priors and regularizers.

Result: Experiments spanning ten multicenter datasets demonstrated MedXAI's capabilities, achieving a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% increase in F1-score for rare classes, outperforming standard deep learning models. It also delivered consistent gains across modalities, such as fMRI and diabetic retinopathy tasks.

Conclusion: MedXAI advances medical AI by enhancing generalization, robustness, and explainability. It successfully captures clinically relevant insights, improving diagnostic precision, especially for rare diseases and under domain shifts, offering a promising solution for clinical AI applications.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly under domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning models often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Medical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

*Shiv Ratn,Shivang Rampriyan,Bahni Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid physics-ML framework using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to enhance water flux (Jw) prediction in Forward Osmosis (FO), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and advanced uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges in accurately modeling water flux (Jw) in FO processes, overcoming limitations of traditional mechanisms and data-driven models, including parameter variability, lack of physical consistency, and weak uncertainty quantification.

Method: The proposed approach trains a Gaussian Process Regression model on residual errors between physical model predictions and experimental data, incorporating robust uncertainty quantification by separating unpredictable and input-based uncertainties.

Result: The model achieved unprecedented performance with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on independent test data, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability with a small amount of training data.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively combines physics-based modeling and machine learning, offering a robust, uncertainty-aware tool for FO process optimization and digital twin applications, solving key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Forward Osmosis (FO) is a promising low-energy membrane separation technology, but challenges in accurately modelling its water flux (Jw) persist due to complex internal mass transfer phenomena. Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.

*Sangli Teng,Hang Liu,Jingyu Song,Koushil Sreenath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHyLL presents a new methodology to learn continuous hybrid systems without discrete mode segmentation or mode switching by reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid systems are difficult to model due to challenges in handling discrete mode switching and discontinuities in continuous flow.

Method: CHyLL uses a continuous neural representation, reformulates state space as a quotient manifold, and applies differential topology insights to learn singularity-free neural embeddings and continuous flow.

Result: CHyLL demonstrates accurate flow predictions of hybrid systems and identifies their topological invariants.

Conclusion: CHyLL advances hybrid system modeling by achieving high-accuracy predictions and opens possibilities for stochastic optimal control applications.

Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of Shannon entropy estimation in small or undersampled datasets, where traditional methods face negative bias challenges.

Method: The proposed discrete entropy estimator combines decomposability properties with estimates for missing mass and unseen outcomes to mitigate bias.

Result: Experimental results indicate the new method surpasses classical estimators in limited data scenarios and matches the performance of advanced state-of-the-art estimators.

Conclusion: The method effectively tackles bias in Shannon entropy estimation under undersampled conditions, providing a reliable alternative for small datasets.

Abstract: Reliable data-driven estimation of Shannon entropy from small data sets, where the number of examples is potentially smaller than the number of possible outcomes, is a critical matter in several applications. In this paper, we introduce a discrete entropy estimator, where we use the decomposability property in combination with estimations of the missing mass and the number of unseen outcomes to compensate for the negative bias induced by them. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some classical estimators in undersampled regimes, and performs comparably with some well-established state-of-the-art estimators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural networks, particularly vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), to extrapolate periodic functions beyond training boundaries without prior knowledge of the function.

Result: MLPs with NB2E were able to extrapolate diverse periodic signals, showing enhanced learning and extrapolation capabilities.

Conclusion: With NB2E, neural networks can learn and generalize periodic structures independently of their positional context, improving function extrapolation.

Abstract: We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds. We introduce Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) as a method for encoding continuous numerical values and demonstrate that, using this input encoding, vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

*Sarwan Ali,Taslim Murad,Imdadullah Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method that uses Chaos Game Representation and Rips complex to convert molecular sequences into topological images for classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for molecular sequence classification face challenges like sparsity and high computational demands. Deep learning models struggle with tabular biological data. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The molecular sequences are transformed into 2D images using Chaos Game Representation. Rips complexes are constructed based on pairwise distances to capture topological and structural features.

Result: The method showed high accuracy on anticancer peptide datasets: 86.8% for breast cancer and 94.5% for lung cancer classification, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed topological representation effectively preserves molecular sequence information and leverages vision-based deep learning architectures for improved analysis.

Abstract: Traditional feature engineering approaches for molecular sequence classification suffer from sparsity issues and computational complexity, while deep learning models often underperform on tabular biological data. This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. Our method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. We provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8\% and 94.5\% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

*Chirag Modi,Jiequn Han,Eric Vanden-Eijnden,Joan Bruna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel generative model approach called self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI) to handle noisy and corrupted data using iterative transport mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building generative models when clean datasets are unavailable and data are contaminated through noisy, ill-conditioned processes.

Method: The method uses Stochastic Interpolants for iteratively updating transport maps between corrupted and clean data, with black-box access to corruption channels, to invert noisy effects and construct generative models.

Result: The proposed SCSI method showed superior performance in inverse problems, particularly in natural image processing and scientific data reconstruction, with established convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: SCSI is a flexible, computationally efficient, and theoretically backed method for handling corrupted data in generative modeling, outperforming existing alternatives.

Abstract: Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable embedding method using hashing for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lineages, achieving high classification accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of computational and embedding-based techniques in analyzing large-scale SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences for early COVID-19 detection.

Method: The method uses hashing to create low-dimensional spike sequence embeddings, which are employed in different machine learning models for lineage classification.

Result: The approach achieves up to 86.4% classification accuracy while significantly reducing computation time by 99.81%, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed embedding method is highly effective, scalable, and suitable for large-scale viral sequence analysis, enabling faster and more accurate SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification.

Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.

### [227] [Decoupled Q-Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10926)
*Qiyang Li,Seohong Park,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm to improve temporal-difference methods by solving challenges of chunked critics for long sequences, enabling better performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal-difference methods suffer from bootstrapping bias, and recent chunked critics struggle with policy reactivity and complexity as chunk lengths increase.

Method: Design a decoupled system where the critic operates over long chunks but policy operates over shorter chunks, using distilled critics for better partial chunk optimization.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in challenging long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed design enhances multi-step value propagation while addressing critical limitations of chunked critics, showcasing its effectiveness practically.

Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.

### [228] [Rethinking Causal Discovery Through the Lens of Exchangeability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10152)
*Tiago Brogueira,Mário Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that causal discovery framed under i.i.d. assumptions is better understood using the broader principle of exchangeability. The authors provide theoretical insights, introduce a novel synthetic dataset based on exchangeability, and validate it with a new neural network method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reframing causal discovery under the broader concept of exchangeability instead of the i.i.d. assumption to address its limitations and better align with real-world data contexts.

Method: Conceptual and empirical arguments supporting exchangeability for causal discovery, introduction of an exchangeable synthetic dataset, and a neural network algorithm trained on this dataset for validation.

Result: The novel synthetic dataset aligns better with real-world statistical structures compared to traditional i.i.d. datasets. The proposed neural-network algorithm trained on this dataset demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Causal discovery should move beyond i.i.d. to exchangeability, as this approach better reflects real-world data settings and results in robust methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery methods have traditionally been developed under two distinct regimes: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and timeseries data, each governed by separate modelling assumptions. In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world "i.i.d." benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world "i.i.d." dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai,Katsutoshi Yada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CIEGAD, a framework for data augmentation addressing scarcity and imbalance issues, improving classification performance and semantic coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of data and label imbalances in real-world deep learning tasks cause misclassification near class boundaries and instability in peripheral regions.

Method: CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, combines class frequency and geometric indicators for allocation, and controls generation directions via interpolative and extrapolative synthesis, supported by geometry-constrained filtering and an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism for quality control.

Result: Experiments on classification tasks show CIEGAD improves semantic coverage, F1 scores, and recall, particularly for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, ensuring consistency, diversity, and quality.

Conclusion: CIEGAD is a novel, practical data augmentation framework that enhances semantic coverage and real-world alignment, addressing underrepresented regions effectively.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

*Abolfazl Shahrooei,Luke Arthur,Om Patel,Derek Kamper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores decoding fingertip force using HD-sEMG data and compares spiking neural networks (SNN) with a temporal convolutional network (TCN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural activity decoding for controlling assistive and rehabilitation devices by exploring and comparing TCN and SNN models.

Method: HD-sEMG data from a participant was decomposed using ICA into motor-unit activity, and TCN and SNN architectures were trained and evaluated on their ability to decode fingertip force.

Result: The TCN achieved superior performance (4.44% MVC RMSE, r=0.974) compared to the SNN (8.25% MVC RMSE, r=0.922).

Conclusion: Although the TCN performed better, the SNN shows potential as a neuromorphic baseline with opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the capability of automated theorem provers like Dafny in handling a mathematical reasoning benchmark and assess how automation and AI models (LLMs) can collaboratively solve theorem proving challenges.

Method: The paper translates the miniF2F benchmark to Dafny, evaluates Dafny's automation capabilities, and tests multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate hints for unverified problems, utilizing iterative error correction.

Result: Dafny verifies 40.6% of the test set and 44.7% of the validation set with full automation. The best-performing LLM achieves a 55.7% success rate in providing proof hints when iterative error correction is employed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Dafny's automation for low-level details and LLMs' high-level reasoning to tackle mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating potential in collaborative problem-solving approaches.

Abstract: We present miniF2F-Dafny, the first translation of the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F to an automated theorem prover: Dafny. Previously, the benchmark existed only in interactive theorem provers (Lean, Isabelle, HOL Light, Metamath). We find that Dafny's automation verifies 99/244 (40.6%) of the test set and 109/244 (44.7%) of the validation set with empty proofs--requiring no manual proof steps. For problems where empty proofs fail, we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf LLMs on providing proof hints. The best model we test achieves 55.7% pass@4 success rate employing iterative error correction. These preliminary results highlight an effective division of labor: LLMs provide high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub at http://github.com/dafny-lang/miniF2F .

### [232] [Exact Recovery of Non-Random Missing Multidimensional Time Series via Temporal Isometric Delay-Embedding Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10191)
*Hao Shu,Jicheng Li,Yu Jin,Ling Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses flaws in tensor completion for non-random missing data in multidimensional time series, proposing LRTC-TIDT model for exact recovery under certain conditions. It shows superior performance in practical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-random missing data in multidimensional time series undermines data-driven analyses, and classical tensor completion methods fail to effectively address these patterns.

Method: The authors propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform to create low-rank Hankel tensors, leveraging smoothness and periodicity properties. They integrate this structure into the LRTC-TIDT model under the t-SVD framework.

Result: The LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery under specific conditions and consistently outperforms existing tensor-based recovery approaches in simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The LRTC-TIDT model provides a theoretically justified and practical solution for recovering non-random missing data in multidimensional time series, advancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making.

Abstract: Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT.

*Ragja Palakkadavath,Hung Le,Thanh Nguyen-Tang,Svetha Venkatesh,Sunil Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG), enhancing model generalization and privacy through innovations in client training and aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address distribution shifts and privacy issues in federated learning methods, as current solutions can compromise client data privacy by sharing statistics.

Method: Key contributions include a latent space inversion technique for privacy in local training and an important weight aggregation strategy to prioritize significant parameters during model aggregation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in both enhancing model generalization to unseen clients and preserving data privacy within federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Information Routing (AIR), a framework for multimodal time series forecasting, utilizing text data to dynamically guide predictions and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods often lack accuracy due to limited reliance only on historical data. Using multimodal approaches with text data offers enhanced context for better predictions.

Method: The AIR framework dynamically incorporates text data to control the multivariate time series model behavior, supported by a text-refinement pipeline using a large language model.

Result: Experiments using market data like crude oil prices and exchange rates show AIR improves forecasting accuracy significantly.

Conclusion: The use of AIR for multimodal forecasting demonstrates its capability to enhance prediction outcomes by dynamically combining textual and time series data.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.

*Duo Wang,Xinming Wang,Chao Wang,Xiaowei Yue,Jianguo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the R^2-HGP framework to improve multi-output Gaussian process models in transfer learning scenarios by addressing challenges like heterogeneous input spaces and negative transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional multi-output Gaussian process models in transfer learning scenarios including handling heterogeneous input spaces, ignoring physical knowledge, and managing negative transfer.

Method: The R^2-HGP framework introduces a prior probability mapping for input alignment, integrates it with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), incorporates physical insights as regularization, and applies sparsity penalties on transfer coefficients.

Result: Extensive simulations and engineering case studies show the R^2-HGP's superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks in diverse metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed R^2-HGP framework successfully addresses challenges in heterogeneous transfer learning, showcasing robust and effective performance across various applications.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.

*Apurba Sarker,Reza T. Batley,Darshan Sarojini,Sourav Saha*

TL;DR: KHRONOS, a novel kernel-based neural surrogate, integrates high-fidelity and low-fidelity aerodynamic data for efficient and accurate aerodynamic predictions in resource-constrained conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for efficient surrogate models that substantially reduce computational costs while maintaining predictive accuracy in aerodynamic simulations and optimization tasks.

Method: KHRONOS leverages theoretical principles like variational methods, interpolation, and tensor decomposition to optimize resource use and blends high-fidelity and low-fidelity data within a kernel-based neural framework. Its performance is benchmarked against MLP, GNN, and PINN models.

Result: KHRONOS demonstrates comparable predictive accuracy to traditional neural networks but distinguishes itself by requiring fewer parameters and delivering faster training and inference, especially under limited high-fidelity data availability and resource constraints.

Conclusion: KHRONOS presents a promising solution for balancing efficiency and accuracy in aerodynamic predictions, advocating for its use in resource-constrained computational environments.

Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy.

*Vasiliki Stoumpou,Maciej Tysarowski,Talhat Azemi,Jawad Haider,Howard L. Haronian,Robert C. Hagberg,Dimitris Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretable framework combining data-driven methods to recommend treatments for severe aortic stenosis (TAVR vs SAVR), showing improved long-term outcomes in both internal and external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Treatment decisions between SAVR and TAVR in low to intermediate-risk severe aortic stenosis patients lack individualized, interpretable recommendations to optimize outcomes, despite existing risk prediction models.

Method: The paper employs prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and Optimal Policy Trees (OPT) to create a prescriptive framework using hospital data to emulate treatment randomization and predict treatment outcomes.

Result: Application of the framework yielded estimated reductions in 5-year mortality by 20.3% (Hartford) and 13.8% (St. Vincent's) compared to current practices, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The framework offers the first transparent and data-driven treatment recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR, aiding precision medicine and improving long-term patient outcomes in structural heart disease.

Abstract: Background. Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.
  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.
  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\% in Hartford and 13.8\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.
  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

*Nicolas Tacheny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a geometric framework for analyzing behaviors of agentic systems built on large language models, focusing on their iterative transformation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control the geometric behavior (convergence, divergence, or dynamics) of recursive feedback loops in agentic systems utilizing large language models, which remains understudied.

Method: The authors introduced a framework analyzing agentic trajectories as discrete dynamical systems in semantic embedding spaces. They also corrected embedding anisotropy bias using isotonic calibration for accurate trajectory measurements.

Result: Two fundamental regimes were identified: contractive loops that stabilize towards an attractor with decreasing dispersion and exploratory loops which diverge without forming clusters. Prompt design was found to govern these dynamical behaviors.

Conclusion: Agentic loop behaviors can be systematically controlled through prompt design, enabling predictable outcomes such as convergence or divergence in iterative transformations.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

*Hyunsung Kim,Sangwoo Seo,Hoyoung Choi,Tom Boomstra,Jinsung Yoon,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DEFCON, a framework to measure defensive contributions in soccer by assessing player impact beyond visible actions like tackles, using Graph Attention Networks and Expected Possession Value (EPV) changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation systems mostly focus on visible on-ball actions, failing to account for defensive impact in preventing dangerous opportunities beforehand.

Method: DEFCON uses Graph Attention Networks to evaluate each attacking option's success and defenders' responsibility by measuring EPV changes before and after actions based on data from Eredivisie games.

Result: The framework's aggregated player credits show strong correlations with market valuations and provide detailed defensive analyses, such as timelines and spatial interactions.

Conclusion: DEFCON effectively quantifies defensive contributions and offers versatile insights, improving our understanding of defensive performance in soccer.

Abstract: Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.

TL;DR: This paper explores underwater autonomous navigation using deep reinforcement learning with the PPO algorithm, compared to a kinematic planner, yielding better performance in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating underwater is challenging due to the lack of GPS, poor visibility, and submerged obstacles. A solution is needed to achieve reliable autonomous navigation.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning approach using PPO is applied, along with navigation data, occupancy grids, and ray-casting. Performance is evaluated in simulation and physical tests.

Result: The PPO algorithm consistently surpasses traditional methods like Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) in avoiding collisions and adapting locally in cluttered underwater environments.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning is effective and transferable from simulation to real-world underwater navigation, suggesting its utility in underwater robotics.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics.

*Vijay Prakash S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses modeling the nonlinear magnetization response of ferromagnetic materials to external magnetic fields using a continued fraction of straight lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the nonlinear behavior of magnetization in ferromagnetic substances as microscopic magnetic domains align with an external field.

Method: A continued fraction of straight lines is used to approximate the nonlinear magnetization behavior, and nonlinear regression is employed to estimate the parameters.

Result: The approach provides a fit for interpreting the nonlinear growth and reduction of magnetic domains in response to magnetic fields.

Conclusion: The continued fraction model is an effective analytical tool to estimate and interpret parameters related to the nonlinearity in magnetization.

Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

*Zhou Feng,Jiahao Chen,Chunyi Zhou,Yuwen Pu,Tianyu Du,Jinbao Li,Jianhai Chen,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of backdoor attacks on DNNs, develops a novel framework called Eminence exploiting vulnerable decision boundaries, achieving highly efficient attacks with low poison rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current backdoor attacks rely on heuristic methods without rigorous theoretical grounding, limiting understanding of mechanisms and attack adaptability.

Method: The study offers theoretical analysis of decision boundaries, introduces margin poisoning model manipulation, and develops Eminence—a black-box backdoor framework with stealth properties and low poison rate triggers.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate Eminence achieves >90% attack success rate, negligible clean accuracy loss, and high transferability across models, datasets, and scenarios with poison rates <0.1%.

Conclusion: Eminence significantly advances backdoor attacks with theoretical validity, efficiency, and robustness, showcasing improved manipulation techniques and reduced poison rates for practical deployment.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.

*Yizhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unifying spectral framework for neural network training dynamics derived from gradient descent, yielding insights into scaling laws, double descent geometry, and the connection between NTK training and feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complex training dynamics of modern deep networks, including phenomena like double descent and scaling laws, through a rigorous operator-theoretic approach.

Method: The authors use operator-theoretic techniques, starting from gradient descent, and apply Kato perturbation theory to derive mode ODEs and a spectral transport-dissipation PDE to describe neural network training dynamics.

Result: The derived PDE reveals that training dynamics inherently preserve functional regularity, contain power-law behavior in eigenbasis drift, and account for phenomena like double descent and specific scaling laws.

Conclusion: The paper successfully connects operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and universal scaling behaviors of deep networks, providing a unifying spectral perspective. NTK training and feature learning are shown as limits of the same underlying PDE.

Abstract: Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport-dissipation PDE \[ \partial_t g + \partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.
  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.
  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.

*Le Tuan Minh Trinh,Le Minh Vu Pham,Thi Minh Anh Pham,An Duc Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops and implements a novel metacognitive framework to evaluate and improve AI models' confidence calibration and decision-making by introducing a metric, meta-d', and a bandit-based arbiter for model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack well-calibrated confidence in their predictions, raising the need to assess and improve how accurately models can judge their own reliability for cognitive tasks.

Method: The paper introduces meta-d', a metacognitive sensitivity measure adapted from psychology, and employs a bandit-based arbiter to dynamically manage model selection for various tasks by leveraging confidence and accuracy signals.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate that the metacognitive approach enhances overall inference accuracy when multiple expert models collaborate.

Conclusion: This work bridges human cognitive science and AI by quantifying confidence reliability and improving ensemble model performance, establishing new methodologies for metacognitive evaluation and selection in AI systems.

Abstract: A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

TL;DR: This paper introduces T-SKM-Net, a new system integrating SKM methods into neural networks for constraint satisfaction, demonstrating efficiency gains and high-performance results on benchmark tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for constraint satisfaction either have high computational costs or stringent assumptions on constraint structures, necessitating a more efficient approach for neural network applications.

Method: The proposed T-SKM-Net transforms mixed constraints into inequality constraints, uses SKM for solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space. It also ensures end-to-end trainability with unbiased gradient estimators for backpropagation.

Result: On benchmark tests like DCOPF case118, T-SKM-Net achieved significant speedups (over 25x compared to pandapower), minimal optimality gaps, and zero constraint violations within tolerance.

Conclusion: T-SKM-Net effectively integrates SKM into neural networks, offering a scalable and trainable solution for solving complex constraint satisfaction problems with superior performance.

Abstract: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UACER, a method combining diversified critic ensembles and a time-varying uncertainty mechanism to improve the robustness and stability of adversarial reinforcement learning in complex environments, demonstrating superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of training instability and convergence difficulties caused by adversaries in robust adversarial reinforcement learning, especially in high-dimensional environments.

Method: The novel UACER framework introduces two strategies: diversified critic ensemble (using K critic networks for stabilizing Q-value estimation) and a time-varying decay uncertainty mechanism (incorporating epistemic uncertainty for dynamic exploration-exploitation trade-off and stable training).

Result: Experiments on several MuJoCo control tasks show that UACER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance, stability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: UACER effectively addresses training challenges in adversarial reinforcement learning, offering improved robustness, stability, and efficiency in sequential decision-making domains.

Abstract: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB) for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning, which dynamically adjusts data sampling based on 'on-policyness' to improve learning stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods for Offline-to-Online RL struggle to balance early stability and ultimate performance when maneuvering between fixed offline datasets and online experiences. There's a need for an adaptive, simpler method to effectively address this challenge.

Method: The proposed method is ARB, a dynamic data sampling strategy using 'on-policyness' to measure alignment between collected trajectories and the current policy, assigning proportional sampling weights without requiring complex learning procedures.

Result: Experimental evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show ARB reduces early performance degradation and significantly enhances final outcomes across various O2O RL algorithms.

Conclusion: ARB provides a straightforward, adaptive solution to balance offline and online data for improved performance in O2O RL algorithms, emphasizing its importance in behavior-aware buffer designs.

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of deploying OOD reasoning systems on resource-constrained devices while maintaining their effectiveness, particularly preserving disentangled latent spaces.

Method: The authors propose the DDE framework using student-teacher distillation and constrained optimization to compress the original model while including constraints to retain disentanglement during distillation.

Result: Theoretical guarantees for model disentanglement are provided using Rademacher complexity, and the compressed model is tested empirically by deployment on NVIDIA hardware.

Conclusion: The DDE framework successfully compresses the model while keeping disentangled space intact, making it suitable for efficient deployment on devices with limited resources.

Abstract: Recently, the disentangled latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) has been used to reason about multi-label out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples that are derived from different distributions than training samples. Disentangled latent space means having one-to-many maps between latent dimensions and generative factors or important characteristics of an image. This paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to decrease the OOD reasoner size for deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement. DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation for model compression as a constrained optimization problem while preserving disentanglement with disentanglement constraints. Theoretical guarantees for disentanglement during distillation based on Rademacher complexity are established. The approach is evaluated empirically by deploying the compressed model on an NVIDIA

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach called the Variational Mode-Seeking Loss (VML) for solving inverse problems using diffusion models, achieving high performance and efficiency without relying on task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods which rely on approximations and are computationally expensive in solving inverse problems.

Method: The Variational Mode-Seeking Loss (VML), a novel loss function, is minimized during each reverse diffusion step to guide generated samples toward MAP estimates. VML minimizes the KL divergence in the context of diffusion models for linear inverse problems without requiring approximations.

Result: VML-MAP, an algorithm derived from theoretical insights behind VML, shows superior performance and reduced computational time in extensive experiments on diverse image restoration tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed VML-MAP algorithm effectively solves inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models, providing both theoretical soundness and empirical efficiency.

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces STA-Attention, a method utilizing Top-K Sparse Autoencoders to decompose the Key-Value caches in large language models into interpretable semantic units, improving their interpretability while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Key-Value cache is a significant memory bottleneck in long-context large language models, yet it remains a largely opaque and poorly understood component. This work aims to achieve mechanistic interpretability of the cache while maintaining the model's functionality.

Method: The paper proposes STA-Attention, leveraging Top-K Sparse Autoencoders to decompose Key-Value caches. Unlike traditional $L_1$-regularized autoencoders, the Top-K approach avoids shrinkage bias while preserving the attention's geometrical properties. They also analyze Key-Value asymmetry and implement a Dual-Budget Strategy to selectively retain meaningful components.

Result: The semantic reconstruction via STA-Attention retains perplexity and zero-shot performance consistent with that of original models across various large language models, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges the gap between interpretability and faithful attention modeling in large language models by decomposing Key-Value caches into interpretable semantic units without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

### [253] [Is the Information Bottleneck Robust Enough? Towards Label-Noise Resistant Information Bottleneck Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10573)
*Yi Huang,Qingyun Sun,Yisen Gao,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaT-IB is a robust variation of the Information Bottleneck method designed to resist label noise by introducing a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion and using noise-aware latent disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of the original Information Bottleneck (IB) method to label noise, which is prevalent in real-world scenarios, and to enhance representation learning robustness.

Method: The paper introduces LaT-IB, which applies a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion as a regularizer. It uses noise-aware latent disentanglement to separate clean and noisy information in representation learning and implements a three-phase training framework for progressive robustness.

Result: LaT-IB outperforms standard methods by achieving higher robustness and efficiency in scenarios characterized by label noise.

Conclusion: The proposed LaT-IB method enhances IB's performance under label noise, making it more applicable and effective in real-world machine learning tasks.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

TL;DR: THeGAU addresses type loss and structural noise issues in HGNNs by combining a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation for enhanced node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs face challenges related to type information loss and structural noise affecting their fidelity and generalization.

Method: THeGAU uses schema-valid edge reconstruction for preserving node-type semantics and a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism for refining noisy structures, integrated in a model-agnostic framework.

Result: THeGAU delivers state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks on HIN datasets, surpassing existing methods across different HGNN backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of HGNNs while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for modeling Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which encode complex multi-typed entities and relations. However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.

TL;DR: The thesis develops new algorithms and theoretical frameworks to enhance constrained reinforcement learning, focusing on optimizing safety and preferences across various settings, including applications to large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safety, efficiency, and alignment in constrained reinforcement learning models across average-cost, episodic paradigms, and human preferences, ensuring robust decision-making.

Method: Introduces algorithms like ACPO, e-COP, warmPref-PS, PSPL, and MOPO with innovative strategies for policy optimization, posterior sampling, modeling human preferences, and scalable multi-objective optimization.

Result: The developed methods achieved state-of-the-art empirical performances, provided theoretical guarantees, reduced regret, and improved alignment with human preferences even for large-scale language models.

Conclusion: The work unifies constrained reinforcement learning approaches across diverse domains, offering theoretical advancements and practical solutions for safe and aligned decision-making models.

Abstract: This thesis develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms that advance constrained reinforcement learning (RL) across control, preference learning, and alignment of large language models. The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to make reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) interact in real-time, akin to human multitasking, without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of sequential reasoning in state-of-the-art LLMs, which hampers their usability in real-time applications like voice-based or embedded assistants.

Method: The authors use properties of rotary embeddings to enable asynchronous operations, allowing LLMs to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs without sequential constraints.

Result: The proposed approach achieves significant improvement, reducing time to first response token to <= 5 seconds and overall delays by 6-11 times, with successful evaluations in math, commonsense, and safety reasoning.

Conclusion: This work presents a promising strategy to enhance LLM interactivity and adaptability for real-time scenarios, bridging performance and usability gaps without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

*Hendrik Borras,Yong Wu,Bernhard Klein,Holger Fröning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-level quantization framework for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), achieving a significant reduction in resource requirements while preserving accuracy and uncertainty measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs provide principled uncertainty quantification but are computationally expensive, and there's a lack of research on applying quantization techniques to reduce resource requirements, particularly in probabilistic models.

Method: Introduces a framework distinguishing three quantization strategies (VPQ, SPQ, JQ), incorporating logarithmic quantization for variance parameters and specialized activation functions to maintain distributional calibration.

Result: Experiments on Dirty-MNIST demonstrate BNNs can be quantized to 4-bit precision while retaining classification accuracy and uncertainty performance, resulting in up to 8x memory savings.

Conclusion: The presented quantization framework facilitates the deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained devices and guides future design of low-precision analog Bayesian machines.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog "Bayesian Machines" operating at inherently low precision.

*Mingzhi Chen,Taiming Lu,Jiachen Zhu,Mingjie Sun,Zhuang Liu*

TL;DR: This paper presents Derf, a new point-wise function that outperforms normalization techniques like LayerNorm and RMSNorm in various domains, opening paths for more effective normalization-free architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to surpass normalization techniques and the recently proposed Dynamic Tanh (DyT) by exploring alternative function designs for stable convergence and improved performance.

Method: The authors study properties of point-wise functions, conduct large-scale searches, and introduce Derf (based on the Gaussian cumulative distribution function).

Result: Derf significantly outperforms existing normalization methods—LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT—in applications like image recognition, speech representation, and DNA modeling.

Conclusion: Derf demonstrates improved generalization and simplicity, suggesting its potential as a superior alternative for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

Result: The methodology was tested and validated with historical data, proving its applicability for migration-related policy decisions.

Conclusion: Integrating data-driven approaches with expert judgment provides a novel, operationally valuable tool tailored to EU migration governance needs.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-methodology to forecast illegal border crossings in Europe across five key migratory routes, with a one-year time horizon. The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets.

It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.

TL;DR: The paper explores the behavior of attention mechanisms at extreme sequence lengths by introducing token-sample complexity, analyzing convergence rates of attention maps and transformed token distributions, and validating predictions experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how attention mechanisms perform under very long context windows in large language models by quantifying convergence rates of attention computations.

Method: The authors conduct a mathematical analysis of attention's convergence rates, introduce token-sample complexity, and validate theoretical findings on synthetic Gaussian data and BERT models using Wikipedia text.

Result: They derive bounds for uniform convergence of attention maps and moments of transformed token distributions, finding differing convergence rates depending on attention geometry and distribution spectral properties. Experimental results align with the theory.

Conclusion: The study provides insights on how attention behaves at very long sequences lengths, offering theoretical and practical guidelines for large-scale language model design.

Abstract: As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.

TL;DR: This paper presents Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method that explains outliers detected by Local Outlier Factor (LOF) through efficient counterfactual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in the widely-used Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method for unsupervised outlier detection and to enhance understanding of outlier explanations.

Method: The authors propose DCFO, which leverages data partitioning to create regions where LOF behaves smoothly and applies gradient-based optimization to generate effective counterfactual explanations.

Result: DCFO demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, offering better proximity and validity of counterfactuals across experiments conducted on 50 OpenML datasets.

Conclusion: DCFO successfully enhances the interpretability of the LOF algorithm, advancing the field of outlier detection and explanation through its innovative approach.

Abstract: Outlier detection identifies data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the data distribution. Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

*Lingjing Kong,Shaoan Xie,Yang Jiao,Yetian Chen,Yanhui Guo,Simone Shao,Yan Gao,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses compositional generalization by introducing a hierarchical approach to decomposing high-level concepts into lower-level, recombinable elements, enabling novel combinations of ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inspiration stems from the necessity to understand and facilitate compositional generalization, a critical aspect enabling models to surpass limited learning experiences by drawing analogies between concepts similar to human reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical data-generating process based on principles of causal modularity and minimal changes, which encodes varying levels of concepts and their interactions. They also prove the identifiability of this structure from observable data.

Result: The study demonstrates that their approach enables compositional generalization for complex relationships, surpassing prior work with simpler interaction assumptions. Additionally, the framework achieves significant improvements on benchmark datasets, validating the theory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that utilizing a hierarchical, modular approach rooted in causal relationships and minimal intervention can facilitate compositional generalization, enhancing models' ability to generate and understand novel concept combinations.

Abstract: Compositional generalization -- the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of learned concepts -- enables models to extend their capabilities beyond limited experiences. While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.
  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for interpretable deep generative models based on causal minimality, enabling causal interpretation, hierarchical organization, and controllability in learned representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the opacity of existing deep generative models, improving interpretability, control, and alignment while avoiding reliance on subjective insights alone.

Method: The authors implement the principle of causal minimality to structure the latent representations of models and derive a theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, applying sparsity or compression constraints.

Result: They demonstrate that under their conditions, the learned representations equate to true latent variables. Empirically, their method enables extraction of hierarchical concept graphs and improves model understanding and steering.

Conclusion: The study introduces a method that enhances the transparency and alignment of generative models, offering robust control and causal interpretation.

Abstract: Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spherical neural operator (GSNO) and its hierarchical architecture (GSHNet), designed to tackle challenges in learning on spherical domains with flexibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend neural operators to spherical domains effectively while preserving intrinsic geometry and addressing rotational consistency challenges in real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed GSNO based on a spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, combined with a spectral learning method. GSHNet leverages GSNO with hierarchical multi-scale spectral modeling and spherical up-down sampling for better global feature representation.

Result: GSNO and GSHNet outperform current state-of-the-art methods on applications such as diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed methods establish a robust and versatile framework for spherical operator learning, addressing both theoretical rigor and practical complexities effectively.

Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN) to improve graph classification by addressing expressivity and interpretability challenges in existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs mostly rely on the message passing strategy limited by 1-WL expressivity, while k-WL approaches improve expressivity but are computationally intensive and less interpretable.

Method: The authors propose creating a line graph from induced subgraphs centered at nodes to enable higher-order aggregation with theoretical superiority over 2-WL models.

Result: Experiments show LGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to k-WL-based GNNs, with better interpretability and reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: LGAN balances performance and interpretability, surpassing the expressiveness of 2-WL GNNs with reduced complexity, making it a practical solution for graph classification.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.

TL;DR: UniExtreme is a proposed universal foundation model for extreme weather forecasting, outperforming baselines by incorporating spectral and event-prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited ability of existing models to predict diverse extreme weather events, considering the challenges of spectral disparity and complex atmospheric patterns.

Method: The model integrates an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) for spectral differences and an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) for hierarchical extreme diversity through memory fusion.

Result: UniExtreme achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in forecasting both general and extreme weather.

Conclusion: UniExtreme offers a robust and adaptable approach by addressing key challenges in extreme weather forecasting through novel methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents a template-free, Transformer-based model for retrosynthesis reaction prediction, surpassing previous methods on the USPTO-50K benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of handcrafted templates and low accuracy in existing retrosynthesis models, enabling practical deployment in organic synthesis.

Method: A Transformer-based framework is enhanced with molecular graph information in the attention mechanism and paired data augmentation to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance among template-free methods on the challenging USPTO-50K benchmark.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating structural and sequence information using the Transformer architecture can significantly improve retrosynthesis predictions.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis reaction prediction seeks to infer plausible reactant molecules for a given product and is a central problem in computer-aided organic synthesis. Despite recent progress, many existing models still fall short of the accuracy and robustness required for practical deployment. This work studies a template-free, Transformer-based framework that eliminates reliance on handcrafted reaction templates or additional chemical rule engines. The model injects molecular graph information into the attention mechanism to jointly exploit \SMILES\ sequences and structural cues, and further applies a paired data augmentation strategy to enhance training diversity and scale. On the USPTO-50K benchmark, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among template-free methods and substantially outperforming a vanilla Transformer baseline.

*Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng,Vivek Narayanaswamy,Shusen Liu,Wesam A. Sakla,Kowshik Thopalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) to improve interpretability and steerability of Sparse Autoencoders in LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve Sparse Autoencoders by addressing their current challenges of limited interpretability and steerability of neurons, as well as the lack of user-desired concepts in unsupervised learned dictionaries.

Method: They present CB-SAE, a framework that prunes low-utility neurons and integrates a concept bottleneck aligned to user-defined concept sets. Two additional interpretability and steerability metrics are introduced for systematic evaluation.

Result: CB-SAE demonstrates improved interpretability (+32.1%) and steerability (+14.5%) in LVLMs and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the practical utility of Sparse Autoencoders to make them more effective for downstream applications while addressing existing limitations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

*Atahan Cilan,Atay Özgövde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to create diverse and controllable player behaviors, avoiding the need for human gameplay data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for simulating player behaviors often require large-scale human gameplay data or lack scalability and controllability, making them inefficient or impractical in dynamic gaming environments.

Method: The policy uses reinforcement learning with N-dimensional continuous behavior vectors as inputs, combining current and target vectors to guide agents towards achieving specified behaviors through normalized rewards, all managed by a single PPO-based multi-agent system.

Result: The proposed framework generates diverse and accurate behavioral styles, effectively matching specified behavior vectors and surpassing baseline methods in experiments conducted on a custom Unity game.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable, flexible, and human-like behavior simulation tool for applications in automated playtesting, game balancing, and real-time player substitution in online environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian symbolic regression method using Sequential Monte Carlo to handle noise and provide uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression's potential for discovering governing equations is limited by its sensitivity to noise, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The paper uses a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework with probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and normalized marginal likelihood to improve robustness in symbolic regression, differing from genetic programming methods.

Result: The method outperforms traditional genetic programming on noisy benchmark datasets, producing parsimonious and generalizable equations.

Conclusion: The proposed SMC-based approach enhances the reliability and applicability of symbolic regression, especially in scientific discovery and engineering.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.

*Dimitri von Rütte,Janis Fluri,Omead Pooladzandi,Bernhard Schölkopf,Thomas Hofmann,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates scaling laws and performance of discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) in comparison to autoregressive language models (ALMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unanswered questions regarding the scaling behavior of discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) and determine their efficiency compared to autoregressive language models (ALMs).

Method: The authors smoothly interpolate between masked and uniform diffusion noise types and analyze hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate, scaling up models to test their compute and data efficiency.

Result: The study finds that uniform diffusion requires less data but more parameters than masked diffusion, making it advantageous in data-limited settings.

Conclusion: Uniform diffusion models show promising scaling behavior. The paper scales such a model to 10B parameters/$10^{22}$ FLOPs, achieving notable efficiency in compute-limited environments and establishing their relevance in future large-scale model development.

Abstract: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.
  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.

Result: Linear models (Linear, NLinear, and DLinear) outperform Transformer-family models, with DLinear showing the best accuracy.

Conclusion: Linear models, when carefully designed, can be strong baselines for time series forecasting in exogenous-only scenarios.

Abstract: We study long-horizon exogenous-only temperature forecasting - a challenging univariate setting where only the past values of the indoor temperature are used for prediction - using linear and Transformer-family models. We evaluate Linear, NLinear, DLinear, Transformer, Informer, and Autoformer under standardized train, validation, and test splits. Results show that linear baselines (Linear, NLinear, DLinear) consistently outperform more complex Transformer-family architectures, with DLinear achieving the best overall accuracy across all splits. These findings highlight that carefully designed linear models remain strong baselines for time series forecasting in challenging exogenous-only settings.

### [274] [Guided Transfer Learning for Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10877)
*Julian Kleutgens,Claudio Battiloro,Lingkai Kong,Benjamin Grewe,Francesca Dominici,Mauricio Tec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for discrete diffusion models to enable effective transfer learning without fine-tuning, improving efficiency for domain adaptation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models are powerful but require large training datasets, making adaptation to new domains costly or infeasible. Current transfer learning methods are computationally expensive, necessitating a scalable alternative.

Method: The paper introduces GTL, which uses guidance to sample from target distributions without modifying pretrained discrete diffusion models. It provides a unified approach for discrete-time and continuous-time score-based diffusion. Additionally, it proposes an efficient guided sampler to reduce computational load during sampling tasks.

Result: GTL is empirically validated on tasks like synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, showing improved efficiency and practicality for scenarios with large vocabularies and long sequences.

Conclusion: GTL bypasses the need for expensive fine-tuning in discrete diffusion models, making guided language modeling viable and scalable for real-world applications involving long sequential data.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.

*Xuan Zhao,Zhuo Cao,Arya Bangun,Hanno Scharr,Ira Assent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving model reconstruction using counterfactual explanations, leveraging their proximity to decision boundaries in combination with original class data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the potential limitations of using counterfactual explanations for training surrogate models, especially in scenarios with restricted access to labeled data.

Method: The authors propose integrating counterfactual samples with original data points to compute class prototypes via the Wasserstein barycenter, better preserving class distribution structures.

Result: Empirical evaluations across various datasets show that the proposed method enhances fidelity between the surrogate and target models, achieving better reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating counterfactuals with original samples reduces decision boundary shifts and strengthens the surrogate model’s predictive alignment with the target model.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide actionable insights by identifying minimal input changes required to achieve a desired model prediction. Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances. Empirical results across multiple datasets show that our method improves fidelity between the surrogate and target models, validating its effectiveness.

*Stefan Matthes,Markus Schramm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a physics-informed learning framework to infer hydraulic and thermal parameters in CSP plants, using operational data to address diagnostic challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the diagnosis of hydraulic imbalances and receiver degradation in CSP plants through unobserved loop-level mass-flows and heat-loss parameters, which are not accessible with standard tools.

Method: Designed a physics-based learning approach that uses operational data combined with a conjugate heat-transfer model optimized through differentiable learning and data from real-world CSP operations.

Result: The framework reconstructed loop temperatures accurately (RMSE <2°C), estimated loop imbalances, and identified areas of heat loss aligning strongly with infrared thermography assessments.

Conclusion: Operational data can effectively infer physical parameters in CSP systems when integrated with physics-informed modeling and optimization, offering actionable insights for system performance diagnosis.

Abstract: Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.
  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.
  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.

*Max Zimmer,Christophe Roux,Moritz Wagner,Deborah Hendrych,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computationally efficient and straightforward 1-swap algorithm to optimize pruning in large language models, achieving significant reductions in per-layer pruning error and improvements in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks face high resource requirements, which can be reduced using pruning. However, with the growing adoption of large language models, traditional pruning methods struggle due to their inefficiency and suboptimal outcomes for Transformer architectures.

Method: The authors introduce a layer-wise mask selection technique that enforces equal sparsity per row, enabling efficient computation of optimal 1-swaps using the Gram matrix of calibration data. This approach is scalable to LLM-size models and runs efficiently on GPUs.

Result: The proposed 1-swap algorithm reduces per-layer pruning errors by up to 60%, outperforming existing methods like Wanda. It also consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy of state-of-the-art GPT models.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel and effective pruning approach for large language models, significantly improving computational efficiency and model performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of efficiently evaluating adversarial robustness in neural networks, a crucial requirement for deploying such models in real-world applications.

Method: The authors introduce modified Frank-Wolfe methods, a projection-free numerical optimization approach, to construct adversarial attacks. They theoretically and experimentally evaluate these methods against standard techniques and compare them on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Result: The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on different datasets and models, including logistic regression, CNNs, and Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: Projection-free methods such as modified Frank-Wolfe techniques can efficiently construct adversarial attacks, providing a possible advancement in neural network robustness assessment.

Abstract: The construction of adversarial attacks for neural networks appears to be a crucial challenge for their deployment in various services. To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the problem of constructing an efficient and effective adversarial attack from a numerical optimization perspective. Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).

*Xiaona Zhou,Yingyan Zeng,Ran Jin,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a method to select datasets from a heterogeneous pool to enhance model performance under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting datasets from diverse sources for training is critical because current methods often ignore differences in dataset quality and relevance, treating all data as equally relevant.

Method: The authors propose DaSH, which models utility hierarchically at dataset and group levels to make efficient selections and achieve better generalization with fewer observations.

Result: Across two benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperformed state-of-the-art methods by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while needing fewer exploration steps.

Conclusion: DaSH is a robust and efficient dataset selection method suitable for scalable and adaptive workflows in multi-source machine learning.

Abstract: The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.

TL;DR: The paper presents Bidirectional Normalizing Flow (BiFlow), which eliminates the need for exact analytic inverses in Normalizing Flows, improving generation quality and sampling speed significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address causal decoding bottlenecks in NF-based methods and enhance their efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: BiFlow introduces a framework that replaces the need for exact analytical inverses in NFs with a reverse model that approximates the noise-to-data mapping.

Result: BiFlow improves generation quality, accelerates sampling by up to 100x, achieves state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods, and demonstrates competitive performance in single-evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: BiFlow revitalizes classical NF methods by removing analytical inverse constraints, paving the way for further development and broader adoption of NF-based approaches.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.

*Lennart P. L. Landsmeer,Amirreza Movahedin,Mario Negrello,Said Hamdioui,Christos Strydis*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), which replace the training of synaptic delays in spiking neural networks with learned neuron positions in space. It achieves higher performance and efficiency while reducing parameter requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) by addressing the high computational cost, memory demands, and biological implausibility caused by unconstrained, trainable synaptic delays.

Method: The method involves introducing SpSNNs, where neurons learn spatial coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, with delays emerging from inter-neuron distances. This approach reduces the parameter count and uses automatic differentiation for exact delay gradient computation.

Result: SpSNNs outperform conventional SNNs with unconstrained delays on benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy, reduced parameter count, and effective sparsity. They peak in performance in 2D/3D configurations and outperform standard SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SpSNNs provide a biologically plausible and hardware-efficient framework for temporal computations, combining geometric regularization, parameter efficiency, and suitability for hardware implementation.

Abstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between abstract Bayesian inference models and their biological neural implementation, addressing how neural mechanisms can perform probabilistic reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a framework where Gaussian belief propagation is executed through a network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons that encode, propagate, and decode messages into spike-based signals.

Result: The method shows accurate message updates validated by standard algorithms and demonstrates applications in Kalman filtering and Bayesian linear regression tasks.

Conclusion: This approach provides a biologically plausible framework for implementing probabilistic reasoning in spiking neural networks, paving the way for neuromorphic systems that emulate Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Bayesian inference offers a principled account of information processing in natural agents. However, it remains an open question how neural mechanisms perform their abstract operations. We investigate a hypothesis where a distributed form of Bayesian inference, namely message passing on factor graphs, is performed by a simulated network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically, we perform Gaussian belief propagation by encoding messages that come into factor nodes as spike-based signals, propagating these signals through a spiking neural network (SNN) and decoding the spike-based signal back to an outgoing message. Three core linear operations, equality (branching), addition, and multiplication, are realized in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models. Validation against the standard sum-product algorithm shows accurate message updates, while applications to Kalman filtering and Bayesian linear regression demonstrate the framework's potential for both static and dynamic inference tasks. Our results provide a step toward biologically grounded, neuromorphic implementations of probabilistic reasoning.

### [284] [Intrinsically Correct Algorithms and Recursive Coalgebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10748)
*Cass Alexandru,Henning Urbat,Thorsten Wißmann*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for constructing recursive coalgebras, ensuring recursivity and correctness intrinsically through type definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and formalize the process of proving recursivity and correctness of coalgebraically-defined recursive algorithms, which is traditionally complex and ad hoc.

Method: The paper proposes a new concept of well-founded functors on categories indexed by well-founded relations and shows that coalgebras for these functors are recursive. This framework incorporates formal techniques such as ranking functions.

Result: It establishes that well-founded functors intrinsically guarantee recursivity for corresponding coalgebras and demonstrates these abstract results with case studies like Quicksort, the Euclidean algorithm, and CYK parsing. The results are formalized in Cubical Agda.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies the formalization and proof of correctness and termination for recursive algorithms using coalgebras, merging abstract theory with concrete practical examples.

Abstract: Recursive coalgebras provide an elegant categorical tool for modelling recursive algorithms and analysing their termination and correctness. By considering coalgebras over categories of suitably indexed families, the correctness of the corresponding algorithms follows intrinsically just from the type of the computed maps. However, proving recursivity of the underlying coalgebras is non-trivial, and proofs are typically ad hoc. This layer of complexity impedes the formalization of coalgebraically defined recursive algorithms in proof assistants. We introduce a framework for constructing coalgebras which are intrinsically recursive in the sense that the type of the coalgebra guarantees recursivity from the outset. Our approach is based on the novel concept of a well-founded functor on a category of families indexed by a well-founded relation. We show as our main result that every coalgebra for a well-founded functor is recursive, and demonstrate that well-known techniques for proving recursivity and termination such as ranking functions are subsumed by this abstract setup. We present a number of case studies, including Quicksort, the Euclidian algorithm, and CYK parsing. Both the main theoretical result and selected case studies have been formalized in Cubical Agda.

### [285] [Towards Cumulative Abstract Semantics via Handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10861)
*Cade Lueker,Andrew Fox,Bor-Yuh Evan Chang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to modularize control flow in abstract interpretation using scoped effects, improving flexibility and modularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of flexibility in generic abstract interpretation frameworks that intertwine syntax and semantics, hindering modularity.

Method: The framework leverages scoped effects to define cumulative abstract semantics, enabling multiple evaluators and analyses from a single interpreter.

Result: Demonstrates modularity by categorizing effects into syntax elimination and domain-semantic introduction handlers.

Conclusion: Scoped effects facilitate elegant and modular abstract interpretation frameworks, achieving flexibility and reduced complexity.

Abstract: We consider the problem of modularizing control flow in a generic abstract interpretation framework. A generic abstract interpretation framework is not truly flexible if it does not allow interpreting with different path- and flow-sensitivities, by going forwards or backwards, and over- or under-approximately. Most interpreters inherently intertwine syntax and semantics, making the implementation antagonistic to modularity. Current approaches to modular designs require the use of complex data structures (e.g., monad transformers), providing modularity but often proving unwieldy (e.g., lifts). We observe that leveraging scoped effects within an interpreter facilitates the accumulation of semantic fragments against a fixed syntax. In this paper, we define cumulative abstract semantics, illustrating the potential for creating multiple dynamic evaluators and static analyses from one interpreter. This modularity is achieved by grouping effects into two categories: syntax elimination and domain-semantic introduction handlers. Our contribution shows the benefits of using effects as an instrument for designing a clean, elegant, and modular abstract interpretation framework.

Through careful ablations, we show the scaling power in pre-training and post-training phases for competitive performance. We summarize our practical lessons and design recommendations that we hope will provide actionable insights for the broader embodied AI community when adapting powerful foundation models to complex embodied scenarios.

*Steven Caro,Stephen L. Smith*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical approach called HeRD for nonprehensile pushing tasks using reinforcement learning and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning in nonprehensile manipulation tasks, like pushing objects through cluttered spaces.

Method: Introduced HeRD, a hierarchical approach with a high-level RL agent for selecting spatial goals and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model for generating trajectories.

Result: Evaluated in a 2D simulation environment, HeRD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: Hierarchical control with generative planning is effective for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation; code and models are openly available.

Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing objects across cluttered environments, presents a challenging control problem due to complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning requirements. In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.
  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

*Timur Ishuov,Michele Folgheraiter,Madi Nurmanov,Goncalo Gordo,Richárd Farkas,József Dombi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for training humanoid robots efficiently and safely, named Symphony, which integrates multiple methods including swaddling regularization and fading replay buffer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the misconception that learning is fast and emphasizes the need for safe, sample-efficient training for humanoid robots to avoid damages and optimize learning.

Method: Symphony algorithm combines swaddling regularization to restrain actions, limited parametric noise to reduce motor risks, and a fading replay buffer for balanced memory sampling. Temporal Advantage is applied for Actor-Critic updates.

Result: The proposed methods provide safer training conditions, sample efficiency, and mitigate harm to the robot and its environment. Empirical results showcase improved safety and learning outcomes.

Conclusion: The Symphony algorithm demonstrates an effective approach to training humanoid robots from scratch while ensuring safety and efficiency in learning.

Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

*Andrew Razjigaev,Hans Lohr,Alejandro Vargas-Uscategui,Peter King,Tirthankar Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the functional redundancy in six-axis robotic arms by proposing a novel inverse kinematics algorithm that leverages task space decomposition and other methods for fast and efficient toolpath optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and underutilization of inverse kinematics algorithms in manufacturing tasks involving symmetrical tool axes and redundant operations, enabling better toolpath optimization and workspace feasibility.

Method: A new algorithm using task space decomposition, the damped least-squares, and Halley's methods to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics was proposed and tested for optimized toolpath planning.

Result: The algorithm efficiently minimizes joint motion, expands the feasible operating workspace, and successfully demonstrated its effectiveness in a cold spray coating application using a manipulator.

Conclusion: The method provides a fast and robust solution to functionally redundant inverse kinematics tasks while improving workspace feasibility and toolpath optimization, validated on an industrial setup.

Abstract: Industrial automation with six-axis robotic arms is critical for many manufacturing tasks, including welding and additive manufacturing applications; however, many of these operations are functionally redundant due to the symmetrical tool axis, which effectively makes the operation a five-axis task. Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.

*Chuan Huang,Gustaf Hendeby,Isaac Skog*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces two inertial magnetic SLAM systems leveraging low-cost sensors, achieving robust non-visual positioning for emergency scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current magnetic SLAM systems require low-drift odometry and are limited in unmapped regions. The paper aims to overcome these challenges by using non-visual data.

Method: Developed loosely coupled and tightly coupled IM-SLAM systems using inertial measurement units, magnetometer arrays, and barometers with state-space representations.

Result: The tightly coupled system outperformed the loosely coupled one, achieving typical errors of meters per 100 meters traveled.

Conclusion: The study proves the feasibility of developing full 3D IM-SLAM systems at low cost with robust performance in low-visibility and emergency scenarios.

Abstract: Spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields offer a valuable, non-visual information source for positioning. Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.

*Hui Li,Akhlak Uz Zaman,Fujian Yan,Hongsheng He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework employing Contextual Reward Machines to enhance task-oriented grasping, achieving high simulation and real-world success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve task-oriented grasping by managing task complexity and enhancing learning efficiency.

Method: The framework uses Contextual Reward Machines to decompose tasks into sub-tasks with stage-specific contexts and employs transition rewards to optimize learning.

Result: Achieved a 95% success rate in simulations and 83.3% success rate with real robots, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective in improving task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world environments with superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Contextual Reward Machine for task-oriented grasping. The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency. They underscore the model's potential to advance task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world settings.

### [292] [Lies We Can Trust: Quantifying Action Uncertainty with Inaccurate Stochastic Dynamics through Conformalized Nonholonomic Lie Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10294)
*Luís Marques,Maani Ghaffari,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLAPS, a conformal prediction algorithm designed for symmetric system dynamics, providing reliable prediction sets with user-defined certainty for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and in non-Euclidean configurations such as SE(2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of traditional uncertainty quantification methods, which rely on strong error assumptions or uncalibrated estimates, by ensuring more reliable probabilistic guarantees for non-Euclidean systems, such as those with Lie-group-based dynamics.

Method: The authors leverage conformal prediction theory to extend probabilistic guarantees from Euclidean to non-Euclidean spaces like SE(2). They utilize Lie group analysis to redefine prediction set construction, allowing symmetry-aware nonconformity scores for efficient uncertainty representation.

Result: The experiments on simulated JetBot and real MBot demonstrate that the proposed framework produces volume-efficient prediction regions that align better with the actual uncertainty compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By incorporating symmetry-awareness and leveraging Lie groups, CLAPS significantly enhances prediction accuracy and uncertainty representation in robotics systems with non-Euclidean configurations, making it a promising tool for safe control systems.

Abstract: We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and ecological harm caused by mechanical weeding and herbicide usage in agriculture.

Method: Developed a six-wheeled robot with a double four-bar suspension system and a laser guided by 3D linear actuators to detect and remove weeds autonomously.

Result: Field tests showed 86.2% weed detection accuracy, 97% hit rate, and minimal positional error (1.54 mm) at optimal operation parameters.

Conclusion: The robot offers an efficient, accurate, and sustainable solution for precision farming, with significant potential to enhance agricultural practices.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel tendon-driven robotic finger design that achieves load capacity and compliance with fewer actuators, resulting in a lightweight and compact yet efficient model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robotic fingers with dexterous manipulation capabilities, reduced actuator requirements, simplified design, and compactness while preserving load capacity and compliance.

Method: Developing an under-actuated tendon-driven finger with synchronous tendon routing that couples joints mechanically and employs kinematic and static modeling, incorporating tendon elasticity.

Result: A single-finger prototype successfully demonstrated minimal deflection error and high stiffness, while a five-finger robotic hand proved effective in diverse object manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed design achieves predictable stiffness and reliable manipulation performance with fewer actuators, advancing robotic hand design for dexterous tasks.

Abstract: Tendon-driven under-actuated robotic fingers provide advantages for dexterous manipulation through reduced actuator requirements and simplified mechanical design. However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models often underperform in task-specific VLN scenarios despite their reasoning capabilities.

Method: CLASH integrates a reactive small-model planner with a reflective large-language model, introducing mechanisms like panoramic visual prompting and uncertainty-aware collaboration.

Result: CLASH achieves first rank on the VLN-CE leaderboard, demonstrating improved navigation accuracy (SR and SPL) and robustness both in simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The CLASH framework advances VLN tasks by effectively combining complementary models, showcasing enhanced navigation in unseen and real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires robots to follow natural language instructions and navigate complex environments without prior maps. While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods. Real-world experiments demonstrate CLASH's strong robustness, validating its effectiveness in both simulation and deployment scenarios.

Result: The framework enhances cross-scenario adaptability, flexibility, and enables benchmarking, offering a modular system for scalable applications.

Conclusion: RoboNeuron provides a robust and modular platform addressing key limitations in embodied AI, paving the way for future scalable real-world applications.

Abstract: Current embodied AI systems face severe engineering impediments, primarily characterized by poor cross-scenario adaptability, rigid inter-module coupling, and fragmented inference acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for pedestrian localization integrating GNSS, UWB, and IMU, evaluated using three probabilistic methods, with the ESKF yielding the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in pedestrian positioning across outdoor-indoor spaces caused by limitations in individual systems such as GNSS, UWB, and inertial PDR during signal interference and degradation.

Method: This work develops a GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework, combining IMU-based PDR for motion tracking with GNSS (outdoors) and UWB (indoors) updates, supported by a map-based feasibility constraint. Three probabilistic techniques (ESKF, factor graph optimization, and particle filter) are compared.

Result: The unified localization system is implemented in ROS 2, tested in indoor, outdoor, and seamless outdoor-indoor scenarios. Among the probabilistic approaches, ESKF delivers the most consistent performance.

Conclusion: The proposed GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework is effective for seamless pedestrian localization, with ESKF being the optimal probabilistic approach in the evaluated scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous pedestrian positioning across outdoor-indoor environments remains challenging because GNSS, UWB, and inertial PDR are complementary yet individually fragile under signal blockage, multipath, and drift. This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove. We evaluate three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR). Results show that the ESKF provides the most consistent overall performance in our implementation.

*Gaozhao Wang,Xing Liu,Zhenduo Ye,Zhengxiong Liu,Panfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Contact SLAM," a method for robots to perform contact-rich manipulation using tactile sensing and prior knowledge when visual information is unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of blind manipulation where robots cannot rely on vision to perceive the environment during contact-rich tasks.

Method: The paper proposes "Contact SLAM," which uses tactile sensing combined with prior scene knowledge. It also designs an active exploration policy to enhance efficiency and reduce uncertainties in the environment.

Result: The proposed method proved effective and accurate in experiments on tasks like socket assembly and block pushing.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that tactile sensing and active exploration can enable robots to successfully execute blind manipulation in contact-rich scenarios.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation is difficult for robots to execute and requires accurate perception of the environment. In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task.

TL;DR: This paper presents a neural fusion framework combining UWB and inertial odometry for accurate GPS-denied localization, addressing challenges such as multi-path interference and adaptability to environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology in localization, which are influenced by sensor arrangement sensitivity and environmental interferences, particularly in challenging scenarios like tunnels.

Method: A novel neural fusion framework is introduced, combining a graph attention UWB network to learn ranging patterns and a recurrent neural inertial network. It integrates least squares and utilizes a nominal frame approach to enhance performance and adaptability.

Result: Through extensive experiments on various datasets, the method demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness in complex localization scenarios, including handling environments with sparse anchors and non-convex configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed IR-ULSG framework improves the performance and reliability of GPS-denied localization across diverse and challenging conditions, offering a more scalable and adaptable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) has shown promising potential in GPS-denied localization thanks to its lightweight and drift-free characteristics, while the accuracy is limited in real scenarios due to its sensitivity to sensor arrangement and non-Gaussian pattern induced by multi-path or multi-signal interference, which commonly occurs in many typical applications like long tunnels. We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration. Additionally, the integration of least squares and the incorporation of nominal frame enhance overall performance and scalability. The effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets, spanning indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IR-ULSG in handling challenging conditions, including scenarios outside the convex envelope and cases where only a single anchor is available.

TL;DR: Mr. Virgil is a multi-robot localization framework combining graph neural networks and differentiable pose graph optimization to robustly match and optimize localization from UWB-vision data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in multi-robot UWB-vision fusion localization by overcoming dependency on identity-encoded hardware or complex matching algorithms and addressing errors from mismatches.

Method: Proposed Mr. Virgil, which includes a graph neural network for robust data association and pose initialization that feeds into a differentiable pose graph optimization back-end for improved localization accuracy.

Result: Experiments, including real-world and simulated conditions, demonstrate high stability and accuracy under diverse scenarios compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Mr. Virgil achieves effective and decentralized relative localization for multi-robot systems, providing robust solutions to traditional challenges.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB)-vision fusion localization has achieved extensive applications in the domain of multi-agent relative localization. The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications. Experiments spanning varying robot numbers, simulation and real-world, occlusion and non-occlusion conditions showcase the stability and exactitude under various scenes compared to conventional methods.

*Maximillian Fainkich,Kiril Solovey,Anna Clarke*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores using algorithmic trajectory planning to improve parafoil pilot training and safety, obtaining significant performance gains over human pilots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of functional parafoil training simulators and limited work on trajectory planning for safer human-piloted parafoil flights.

Method: The Stable Sparse RRT (SST) algorithm is adapted to compute safe trajectories with minimized control effort, and its solutions are compared with human-generated parafoil flights.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated 20%-80% cost improvement over human pilots and showcased safer, smoother trajectories.

Conclusion: Computer-generated trajectory planning shows promise for enhancing parafoil training simulators, improving pilot safety, and reducing costs.

Abstract: Most skydiving accidents occur during the parafoil-piloting and landing stages and result from human lapses in judgment while piloting the parafoil. Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\%-80\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LEO-RobotAgent is a language-driven framework enabling robots to handle diverse tasks across multiple scenarios efficiently using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot task planning lacks a robust multi-task, multi-robot generalization capability and often relies on complex, non-generalizable algorithms.

Method: Developed a streamlined, modular framework that integrates large language models, allowing them to think, plan, and act independently while incorporating human-robot collaboration.

Result: Framework is adaptable to various robot types—UAVs, robotic arms, wheeled robots—and has successfully executed complex tasks across different scenarios.

Conclusion: LEO-RobotAgent enhances human-robot interaction, delivers strong generalization and efficiency, and simplifies the integration of large models for diverse robotic applications.

Abstract: We propose LEO-RobotAgent, a general-purpose language-driven intelligent agent framework for robots. Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generative evaluation system using a frontier video model to evaluate robot policies across different scenarios, including out-of-distribution conditions and safety probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to expand the use of video models in robotics beyond in-distribution evaluations to a broader spectrum of use cases, such as OOD generalization, safety probing, and realistic policy assessments.

Method: The system utilizes a frontier video foundation model, optimized for robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, and incorporates generative image-editing and multi-view completion to simulate diverse real-world scenarios.

Result: The proposed system can accurately simulate scenes with novel interactions and predict robot policy performance across various generalization axes. The system has been validated on over 1600 real-world evaluations across eight policy checkpoints and five tasks.

Conclusion: This generative evaluation system effectively enables broader and deeper assessments of robot policies, showing potential for advancing realistic policy validation, generalization, and safety testing in robotics.

Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.

*Jianbo Wang,Galina Sidorenko,Johan Thunberg*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to improve safety in multi-vehicle following scenarios during emergency braking by utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address safety concerns related to vehicle collisions and harm mitigation in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) systems while overcoming limitations of conservative worst-case-based control strategies.

Method: A hybrid approach combining DRL with a previously published method for determining optimal constant deceleration is developed to improve collective harm reduction and collision avoidance.

Result: The hybrid approach improves reliability and provides enhanced performance in terms of reducing overall harm and avoiding collisions compared to standalone DRL methods.

Conclusion: Integrating DRL with existing analytical methods enhances safety performance in emergency braking scenarios, demonstrating potential for future vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance driving safety, for example by enabling safe vehicle following and more efficient traffic scheduling. For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of stabilizing multi-agent rigid formations on general planar curves, ensuring effective coordination and formation maintenance in constrained spaces.

Method: The authors propose a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm to find an inscribed regular polygon and a continuous feedback law to guarantee curve sweeping and vertex convergence while maintaining inter-agent avoidance.

Result: The approach was validated using numerical simulations for various types of planar curves and rigid formations, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed feedback law and algorithm successfully stabilize and form equilateral polygonal formations on differentiable curves while ensuring collision avoidance between agents.

Abstract: This work deals with the problem of stabilizing a multi-agent rigid formation on a general class of planar curves. Namely, we seek to stabilize an equilateral polygonal formation on closed planar differentiable curves after a path sweep. The task of finding an inscribed regular polygon centered at the point of interest is solved via a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm for which one is able to ascertain the existence of a minimizer. Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations for different classes of curves and different rigid formations. Code: https://github.com/mebbaid/paper-elobaid-ifacwc-2026

*Samaksh Ujjawal,Shivansh Pratap Singh,Naveen Sudheer Nair,Rishabh Dev Yadav,Wei Pan,Spandan Roy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion-based framework for accurately modeling residual forces in aerial manipulators, improving tracking performance under dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial manipulators experience configuration-dependent changes in inertial and aerodynamic forces, making accurate dynamics modeling for control challenging. Existing models struggle with nonlinear and varying conditions.

Method: The paper introduces a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that uses a conditional diffusion process and a temporal encoder to capture residual forces. The temporal encoder summarizes recent motion and configuration for accurate residual predictions.

Result: When incorporated with an adaptive controller, the framework compensates for dynamics uncertainty, yielding significantly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes modeling limitations by capturing diverse, nonlinear behaviors of residual forces, enhancing aerial manipulator control under dynamic and diverse operating conditions.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators undergo rapid, configuration-dependent changes in inertial coupling forces and aerodynamic forces, making accurate dynamics modeling a core challenge for reliable control. Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.

*Anh-Quan Pham,Marcel Hussing,Shubhankar P. Patankar,Dani S. Bassett,Jorge Mendez-Mendez,Eric Eaton*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of expensive robotic manipulation data collection by proposing a semantic compositional diffusion transformer model, which generalizes to unseen task combinations and improves zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of obtaining demonstrations in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment scenarios due to the combinatorially large task space.

Method: The authors propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components, using attention to learn their interactions. A self-improvement procedure with synthetic data validation via offline reinforcement learning is also introduced.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates substantial zero-shot generalization to unseen task combinations, achieving significantly higher performance compared to baselines and solving almost all held-out tasks.

Conclusion: The model leverages compositional structures to generalize more effectively, and its iterative improvement pipeline showcases the emergence of meaningful compositional representations.

Abstract: Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.

*Zamirddine Mari,Jérôme Pasquet,Julien Seinturier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach for autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments, outperforming a baseline deterministic algorithm despite limited geometric information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in autonomous navigation through constrained tubular spaces, crucial for industrial, underground, or medical applications where perception and geometry are limited.

Method: A reinforcement learning strategy using LiDAR and conditional visual center detection, trained with Curriculum Learning involving progressively complex geometries.

Result: The PPO policy developed demonstrates robust, generalizable behavior, outperforming baseline methods and successfully transferring learned behavior to a high-fidelity 3D environment.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective framework for autonomous drone navigation in unknown tubular environments and offers potential for application in various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments remains a major challenge due to the constraining geometry of the conduits, the proximity of the walls, and the perceptual limitations inherent to such scenarios. We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.
  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents ImplicitRDP, a unified visual-force diffusion policy for integrating vision and force sensing effectively for contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the disparity between vision and force sensing in contact-rich manipulation, creating a unified framework combining spatial and temporal aspects effectively.

Method: Proposes ImplicitRDP, a diffusion policy using Structural Slow-Fast Learning for asynchronous data processing and Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization to enhance learning from force feedback.

Result: ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms vision-only and hierarchical baselines in reactivity and success in various contact-rich tasks, with a more streamlined training pipeline.

Conclusion: Unified integration of vision and force sensing enables more effective and reactive manipulation policies, validated through improved task outcomes and efficient training mechanics.

Abstract: Human-level contact-rich manipulation relies on the distinct roles of two key modalities: vision provides spatially rich but temporally slow global context, while force sensing captures rapid, high-frequency local contact dynamics. Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline. Code and videos will be publicly available at https://implicit-rdp.github.io.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the shortage of verified code datasets required for training large language models in program verification.

Method: The authors developed ATLAS, a system that synthesizes Dafny programs and decomposes these into training examples using specialized tasks.

Result: ATLAS generated 2.7K verified Dafny programs, yielding over 19K training examples. Fine-tuning a language model on this dataset led to significant improvements (+23% on DafnyBench, +50% on DafnySynthesis).

Conclusion: Synthetic verified code from ATLAS can significantly improve the program verification capabilities of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models have shown potential for program verification, but progress is hindered by the scarcity of verified code for training. We present ATLAS, an automated pipeline that synthesizes verified programs at scale to address this data bottleneck. ATLAS generates complete Dafny programs with specifications, implementations, and proofs, producing 2.7K verified programs from which we extract over 19K training examples--more than 7 per verified program--by decomposing the synthesis process into multiple specialized tasks. Fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 7B Coder on this dataset produces substantial gains: +23 percentage points on DafnyBench and +50 percentage points on DafnySynthesis. These results demonstrate that synthetic verified code can effectively enhance LLM capabilities for formal verification.

*Thanosan Prathifkumar,Noble Saji Mathews,Meiyappan Nagappan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the validity of the SWE-Bench-Verified dataset as a benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to solve GitHub issues, raising concerns about dataset contamination due to potential overlaps with model training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether scores on the SWE-Bench-Verified benchmark accurately reflect agent capabilities or are influenced by pre-existing training overlaps.

Method: The researchers tested two Claude models and compared their performance on different benchmarks, including SWE-Bench-Verified, BeetleBox, and SWE-rebench, using constrained setup scenarios.

Result: The models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified compared to other benchmarks, and 6 times better for identifying edited files, indicating potential exposure to the benchmark tasks during training.

Conclusion: Reliance on older benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified risks misrepresenting progress. Transitioning to newer, contamination-aware datasets is essential for accurate evaluations.

Abstract: SWE-Bench-Verified, a dataset comprising 500 issues, serves as a de facto benchmark for evaluating various large language models (LLMs) on their ability to resolve GitHub issues. But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design. Our setup tests the localization step with minimal context to the extent that the task should be logically impossible to solve. Our results show the risk of relying on older popular benchmarks and support the shift toward newer datasets built with contamination in mind.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BinSeek, a two-stage framework for improving binary code analysis with a focus on retrieving relevant stripped binaries using cross-modal techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of retrieving relevant stripped binary functions from a large dataset based on user queries, a challenge exacerbated by the lack of symbolic information.

Method: The proposed BinSeek consists of two models: BinSeek-Embedding for learning semantic relevance and BinSeek-Reranker for refining relevance judgments with context augmentation. An LLM-based data synthesis pipeline was also developed for automated training data creation.

Result: BinSeek achieved state-of-the-art results, improving Rec@3 by 31.42% and MRR@3 by 27.17% compared to models of a similar scale and surpassing much larger general-purpose models.

Conclusion: BinSeek represents significant progress in the field of binary code analysis, offering improved performance and setting a benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: LLM-agent based binary code analysis has demonstrated significant potential across a wide range of software security scenarios, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, etc. In agent workflow, however, retrieving the positive from thousands of stripped binary functions based on user query remains under-studied and challenging, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes it from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters.

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in Large Language Model-based code evaluators in academic settings, introducing a new class of attacks called academic jailbreaking, alongside a poisoned dataset of adversarial submissions and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability and security issues of LLM-based code evaluators, which are increasingly used in academic environments, but susceptible to adversarial manipulation.

Method: Developed and tested 20+ jailbreaking strategies tailored for academic contexts, published a poisoned dataset of 25K student submissions with rubrics, and defined metrics for assessing the impact of attacks on LLMs.

Result: Six LLMs were tested, revealing significant vulnerabilities, with persuasive and role-play-based attacks achieving up to 97% Jailbreak Success Rate.

Conclusion: LLMs used in academic code evaluation are vulnerable to academic jailbreaking attacks, emphasizing the need for improved robustness in future models.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic judges for code evaluation is becoming increasingly prevalent in academic environments. But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment.

*Yang Yang,Li Kuang,Jiakun Liu,Zhongxin Liu,Yingjie Xia,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UniCoR is a proposed framework to improve hybrid and cross-language code retrieval using enhanced semantic understanding and fused code representations, achieving better performance than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing code retrieval models in hybrid and cross-language contexts, specifically issues with semantic understanding, fusion of hybrid queries, and generalization across languages.

Method: UniCoR employs a self-supervised framework with two main modules: (1) a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module for semantic understanding and hybrid query fusion, and (2) a representation distribution consistency learning module to enhance cross-language generalization.

Result: UniCoR demonstrates superior performance over baseline models, with an 8.64% improvement in MRR and 11.54% in MAP, while showcasing stability in hybrid retrieval and cross-language generalization.

Conclusion: UniCoR effectively addresses the challenges in hybrid queries and cross-language contexts, setting a new benchmark in code retrieval performance and robustness.

Abstract: Effective code retrieval is indispensable and it has become an important paradigm to search code in hybrid mode using both natural language and code snippets. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, UniCoR exhibits stability in hybrid code retrieval and generalization capability in cross-language scenarios.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes human-LLM collaboration in coding tasks using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets, identifying interaction mechanisms, LLM's instruction-following ability, and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the dynamics of human-LLM interactions in real-world coding collaborations, addressing challenges like instruction compliance and satisfaction.

Method: Empirical analysis using user-LLM coding interaction datasets (LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat), exploring mechanisms, patterns, and satisfaction metrics.

Result: Findings include varied interaction patterns based on task types, challenges in instruction compliance for bug fixing and code refactoring, and differing user satisfaction levels depending on task types.

Conclusion: Insights from this study can enhance LLM interfaces, optimize user satisfaction, and advance adaptive dialogue systems for coding collaborations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly acting as dynamic conversational interfaces, supporting multi-turn interactions that mimic human-like conversation and facilitate complex tasks like coding. While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems. We believe this work broadens understanding of human-LLM synergies and supports more effective AI-assisted development.

*Georgia M. Kapitsaki,Maria Papoutsoglou,Christoph Treude,Ioanna Theophilou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper reviews how privacy law compliance issues are discussed by developers in GitHub repositories, identifying major concerns like user rights functionality and consent-related issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA have compelled developers to prioritize user data privacy for compliance, yet little empirical evidence exists on open source discussion trends.

Method: The authors mined and analyzed 32,820 GitHub issues, performing partial automated and manual analysis to classify user privacy topics.

Result: 24 categories of compliance discussions were identified, grouped into six clusters. Developers mostly focus on specific rights like right to erasure and consent issues.

Conclusion: The taxonomy can guide practitioners to prioritize critical compliance concerns, aid educators in teaching privacy law, and help researchers address gaps in facilitating law adherence.

Abstract: Context: Privacy legislation has impacted the way software systems are developed, prompting practitioners to update their implementations. Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems. In addition, the educational community can reshape curricula to better educate future engineers on the privacy law concerns raised, and the research community can identify gaps and areas for improvement to support and accelerate data privacy law compliance.

*Itay Dreyfuss,Antonio Abu Nassar,Samuel Ackerman,Axel Ben David,Rami Katan,Orna Raz,Marcel Zalmanovici*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACIFIC, a benchmark framework for evaluating LLMs' abilities to follow sequential instructions and perform code dry-running without execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate assessment of LLMs' intrinsic instruction-following and code comprehension capabilities, particularly their ability to process and reason through code step-by-step without executing it.

Method: The authors propose PACIFIC, a framework for automatically generating benchmarks with defined outputs, allowing evaluation through output comparisons. The framework allows controlled benchmark difficulty adjustments and mitigates data contamination by creating new benchmark variations.

Result: PACIFIC benchmarks are validated across state-of-the-art LLMs, showing successful differentiation in instruction-following and dry-running abilities even among advanced models. The benchmarks demonstrate increased difficulty effectively.

Conclusion: PACIFIC provides a scalable, data-contamination-resistant framework for assessing and benchmarking LLMs' core coding-related competencies. It allows robust evaluation and comparison between models in sequential instruction-following and reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper enhances Go language binary vulnerability detection using a refined concolic execution tool that targets panic-relevant paths, achieving significant speed and performance improvements over existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in vulnerability detection for critical infrastructure Go binaries due to runtime complexities and limitations in existing symbolic execution tools.

Method: Enhanced the Zorya framework by adding bug detection in concretely not taken paths, utilizing a multi-layer filtering strategy for panic-relevant paths, and employing function-mode analysis for better efficiency.

Result: The enhanced framework achieved 1.8-3.9x speed improvements, filtered 33-70% of branches, and detected all panics in tested vulnerabilities, outperforming existing tools.

Conclusion: Specialized concolic execution tailored for Go can offer practical and efficient vulnerability detection solutions in runtime safety-compliant ecosystems.

Abstract: Go's adoption in critical infrastructure intensifies the need for systematic vulnerability detection, yet existing symbolic execution tools struggle with Go binaries due to runtime complexity and scalability challenges. In this work, we build upon Zorya, a concolic execution framework that translates Go binaries to Ghidra's P-Code intermediate representation to address these challenges. We added the detection of bugs in concretely not taken paths and a multi-layer filtering mechanism to concentrate symbolic reasoning on panic-relevant paths. Evaluation on five Go vulnerabilities demonstrates that panic-reachability gating achieves 1.8-3.9x speedups when filtering 33-70% of branches, and that Zorya detects all panics while existing tools detect at most two. Function-mode analysis proved essential for complex programs, running roughly two orders of magnitude faster than starting from main. This work establishes that specialized concolic execution can achieve practical vulnerability detection in language ecosystems with runtime safety checks.

### [321] [Parallel Neuron Groups in the Drosophila Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10525)
*Robert Worden*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A novel neural structure called Parallel Neuron Group (PNG) was identified in the Drosophila brain. PNGs involve clusters of neurons sharing significant input-output connections, comprising about 1000 neurons among 65,000 in the brain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to leverage the complete connectome of an adult Drosophila to discover and understand novel neural structures in the insect brain.

Method: The author analyzed the Drosophila connectome to identify neurons sharing significant numbers of input and output connections and grouped them into Parallel Neuron Groups.

Result: Approximately 20 PNGs were identified, containing around 1000 neurons with distinctive properties, exhibiting lateral asymmetry and centralized input-output neuron formations.

Conclusion: The discovery opens paths for investigating the functional roles of PNGs, their lateral asymmetry, synchronization, and functional distinctions, raising new puzzles about their contribution to neural processing.

Abstract: The full connectome of an adult Drosophila enables a search for novel neural structures in the insect brain. I describe a new neural structure, called a Parallel Neuron Group (PNG). Two neurons are called parallel if they share a significant number of input neurons and output neurons. Most pairs of neurons in the Drosophila brain have very small parallel match. There are about twenty larger groups of neurons for which any pair of neurons in the group has a high match. These are the parallel groups. Parallel groups contain only about 1000 out of the 65,000 neurons in the brain, and have distinctive properties. There are groups in the right mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, the lobula, and in two central neuropils (GNG and EB). Most parallel groups do not have lateral symmetry. A group usually has one major input neuron, which inputs to all the neurons in the group, and a small number of major output neurons. The major input and output neurons are laterally asymmetric. Parallel neuron groups present puzzles, such as: what does a group do, that could not be done by one larger neuron? Do all neurons in a group fire in synchrony, or do they perform different functions? Why are they laterally asymmetric? These may merit further investigation.

*Tiago S. A. N. Simões,José S. Andrade,Hans J. Herrmann,Stefano Zapperi,Lucilla de Arcangelis*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that the economy of scale in larger brains' lower firing rates is explained by avalanche dynamics at criticality, connecting brain activity and metabolism scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why larger brains operate with disproportionately lower firing rates, addressing a long-standing puzzle in brain allometry.

Method: Derives analytical scaling laws from avalanche statistics and verifies them in neuronal networks and self-organized criticality models, with cross-references to experimental observations.

Result: Demonstrates that systems governed by critical avalanches exhibit sublinear activity-size scaling, consistent with observed brain patterns across mammal species.

Conclusion: Avalanche criticality is identified as a universal mechanism linking dynamical criticality to allometric scaling in brain metabolism.

Abstract: Allometric scaling laws, such as Kleiber's law for metabolic rate, highlight how efficiency emerges with size across living systems. The brain, with its characteristic sublinear scaling of activity, has long posed a puzzle: why do larger brains operate with disproportionately lower firing rates? Here we show that this economy of scale is a universal outcome of avalanche dynamics. We derive analytical scaling laws directly from avalanche statistics, establishing that any system governed by critical avalanches must exhibit sublinear activity-size relations. This theoretical prediction is then verified in integrate-and-fire neuronal networks at criticality and in classical self-organized criticality models, demonstrating that the effect is not model-specific but generic. The predicted exponents align with experimental observations across mammal species, bridging dynamical criticality with the allometry of brain metabolism. Our results reveal avalanche criticality as a fundamental mechanism underlying Kleiber-like scaling in the brain.

*C. Sun,D. Fettahoglu,D. Holcman*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a stochastic framework for analyzing spindle-like bursts in EEG signals using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the modeling and segmentation of transient oscillatory bursts (spindles) in EEG signals, which are vital for understanding neural activity and dynamics.

Method: Individual spindles are modeled using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and a segmentation process combines Empirical Mode Decomposition with extremum detection to isolate events. Statistical analysis is conducted on spindle features to derive empirical distributions.

Result: The framework reproduces spindle key features and identifies exponential distributions in amplitude, inter-spindle intervals, and duration. It further incorporates coupled processes to model mixed spindles.

Conclusion: This framework offers a structured, data-driven approach to analyze transient oscillations in EEG signals and nonstationary time series with applications to neuroscience and signal processing.

Abstract: We develop here a stochastic framework for modeling and segmenting transient spindle-like oscillatory bursts in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. At the modeling level, individual spindles are represented as path realizations of a two-dimensional Ornstein{Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a stable focus, providing a low-dimensional stochastic dynamical system whose trajectories reproduce key morphological features of spindles, including their characteristic rise{decay amplitude envelopes. On the signal processing side, we propose a segmentation procedure based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with the detection of a central extremum, which isolates single spindle events and yields a collection of oscillatory atoms. This construction enables a systematic statistical analysis of spindle features: we derive empirical laws for the distributions of amplitudes, inter-spindle intervals, and rise/decay durations, and show that these exhibit exponential tails consistent with the underlying OU dynamics. We further extend the model to a pair of weakly coupled OU processes with distinct natural frequencies, generating a stochastic mixture of slow, fast, and mixed spindles in random temporal order. The resulting framework provides a data-driven framework for the analysis of transient oscillations in EEG and, more generally, in nonstationary time series.

*Tiago Brogueira,Mário A. T. Figueiredo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces LxCIM, a novel metric for binary classification that is invariant to the local exchange of classes, and addresses limitations in existing metrics like AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of widely used evaluation metrics such as AUROC when dealing with problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC).

Method: The authors propose a new metric, LxCIM, which is rank-based and invariant to LxC, while also being logically consistent and easily computable. They compare it to AUROC, accuracy, and AUDRC and show its versatility.

Result: The paper establishes theoretical relationships between LxCIM and existing metrics, validates LxCIM via applications, particularly in bivariate causal discovery, and demonstrates its advantages over traditional metrics.

Conclusion: LxCIM is a useful alternative to current metrics for binary classification tasks, especially when local exchange of classes is relevant, offering more interpretable and consistent evaluation.

Abstract: Binary classification is one of the oldest, most prevalent, and studied problems in machine learning. However, the metrics used to evaluate model performance have received comparatively little attention. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) has long been a standard choice for model comparison. Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC. Finally, we demonstrate the direct applicability of LxCIM to the bivariate causal discovery problem (which exhibits invariance to local exchange of classes) and show how it addresses the acknowledged limitations of existing metrics used in this field.

TL;DR: This paper examines gradient descent under random weighted data points using a linear regression model with generic weighting distributions, providing a unified noise impact framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and analyze the impact of various kinds of noise, including stochastic gradient descent and importance sampling, in optimization and statistical performance.

Method: Characterizes implicit regularization from random weighting and derives convergence bounds using geometric moment contraction while investigating stationary distributions.

Result: Demonstrates how weighting distribution choices affect optimization and statistical properties, including examples showing trade-offs in convergence speed and statistical performance.

Conclusion: Specific weighting distributions can influence optimization and statistical estimator quality, underscoring trade-offs between fast convergence and statistical reliability.

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with randomly weighted data points in a linear regression model, under a generic weighting distribution. This includes various forms of stochastic gradient descent, importance sampling, but also extends to weighting distributions with arbitrary continuous values, thereby providing a unified framework to analyze the impact of various kinds of noise on the training trajectory. We characterize the implicit regularization induced through the random weighting, connect it with weighted linear regression, and derive non-asymptotic bounds for convergence in first and second moments. Leveraging geometric moment contraction, we also investigate the stationary distribution induced by the added noise. Based on these results, we discuss how specific choices of weighting distribution influence both the underlying optimization problem and statistical properties of the resulting estimator, as well as some examples for which weightings that lead to fast convergence cause bad statistical performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between kernel estimation errors and prediction discrepancies in stochastic dynamical systems is critical, especially in systems with memory like generalized Langevin equations.

Method: The study employs synchronized noise coupling, a Volterra comparison theorem, and resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. It also uses a hypocoercive Lyapunov approach to analyze first and second-order kernel models under memory kernel perturbations.

Result: The authors establish bounds on trajectory discrepancies linked to kernel estimation errors. They provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating stability and contraction under specific kernel classes.

Conclusion: Improved kernel estimation directly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy, which is empirically validated by numerical examples and demonstrated for a wide class of kernels.

Abstract: We analyze prediction error in stochastic dynamical systems with memory, focusing on generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) formulated as stochastic Volterra equations. We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The diffusion resampling method is effective and consistent, making it a promising enhancement for differentiable sequential Monte Carlo applications.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with differentiable resampling in the context of sequential Monte Carlo (e.g., particle filtering). We propose a new informative resampling method that is instantly pathwise differentiable, based on an ensemble score diffusion model. We prove that our diffusion resampling method provides a consistent estimate to the resampling distribution, and we show by experiments that it outperforms the state-of-the-art differentiable resampling methods when used for stochastic filtering and parameter estimation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel probabilistic framework for supervised learning rooted in geometry-aware, field-driven generative processes with stochastic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural systems to model uncertain, highly non-Gaussian outputs with deterministic inputs using a geometry-based probabilistic approach.

Method: A latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defines the neural architecture, where neuron locations and synaptic weights are generated stochastically. Sparse connectivity is achieved via percentile-based diffusion masking.

Result: Establishes foundational properties including well-posedness and expressive variability of stochastic mappings through mathematical analysis and Monte Carlo sampling approaches.

Conclusion: The framework integrates geometry-driven processes and stochastic learning, providing initial theoretical validation and suggesting potential for broader applications in uncertain systems modeling.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new probabilistic framework for supervised learning in neural systems. It is designed to model complex, uncertain systems whose random outputs are strongly non-Gaussian given deterministic inputs. The architecture itself is a random object stochastically generated by a latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defined on a compact, boundaryless, multiply-connected manifold. The goal is to establish a novel conceptual and mathematical framework in which neural architectures are realizations of a geometry-aware, field-driven generative process. Both the neural topology and synaptic weights emerge jointly from a latent random field. A reduced-order parameterization governs the spatial intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the manifold, from which neuron locations are sampled. Input and output neurons are identified via extremal evaluations of the latent field, while connectivity is established through geodesic proximity and local field affinity. Synaptic weights are conditionally sampled from the field realization, inducing stochastic output responses even for deterministic inputs. To ensure scalability, the architecture is sparsified via percentile-based diffusion masking, yielding geometry-aware sparse connectivity without ad hoc structural assumptions. Supervised learning is formulated as inference on the generative hyperparameters of the latent field, using a negative log-likelihood loss estimated through Monte Carlo sampling from single-observation-per-input datasets. The paper initiates a mathematical analysis of the model, establishing foundational properties such as well-posedness, measurability, and a preliminary analysis of the expressive variability of the induced stochastic mappings, which support its internal coherence and lay the groundwork for a broader theory of geometry-driven stochastic learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a MaxRM-based random forest method for improved out-of-distribution generalization, providing algorithms, statistical guarantees, and demonstrating effectiveness with different risk metrics on simulated and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop methods that improve generalization of regression models to test environments with distributions differing from those observed during training.

Method: The authors propose computationally efficient random forest methods guided by the MaxRM principle, with statistical consistency, using three risk metrics: mean squared error, negative reward, and regret.

Result: The proposed MaxRM-based method is shown to perform well on simulated and real-world datasets, and a novel out-of-sample guarantee for the regret-based risk is established.

Conclusion: The MaxRM principle can be successfully integrated with random forests to enhance OOD generalization with provable guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: We consider a regression setting where observations are collected in different environments modeled by different data distributions. The field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to design methods that generalize better to test environments whose distributions differ from those observed during training. One line of such works has proposed to minimize the maximum risk across environments, a principle that we refer to as MaxRM (Maximum Risk Minimization). In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method. Our proposed method can be used with each of the following three risks: the mean squared error, the negative reward (which relates to the explained variance), and the regret (which quantifies the excess risk relative to the best predictor). For MaxRM with regret as the risk, we prove a novel out-of-sample guarantee over unseen test distributions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on both simulated and real-world data.

Method: A deep neural network framework with a partially linear regression structure, combining parametric linear components for primary covariates and nonparametric DNN components for complex interactions.

Result: FLEXI-Haz achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates for its DNN component, and the linear estimator is statistically efficient. Simulation and real-data analysis demonstrate its accurate estimation capabilities for linear effects.

Conclusion: The proposed FLEXI-Haz method serves as a reliable, interpretable alternative for survival data modeling, outperforming methods reliant on proportional hazards assumptions.

Abstract: We propose a flexible deep neural network (DNN) framework for modeling survival data within a partially linear regression structure. The approach preserves interpretability through a parametric linear component for covariates of primary interest, while a nonparametric DNN component captures complex time-covariate interactions among nuisance variables. We refer to the method as FLEXI-Haz, a flexible hazard model with a partially linear structure. In contrast to existing DNN approaches for partially linear Cox models, FLEXI-Haz does not rely on the proportional hazards assumption. We establish theoretical guarantees: the neural network component attains minimax-optimal convergence rates based on composite Holder classes, and the linear estimator is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that FLEXI-Haz provides accurate estimation of the linear effect, offering a principled and interpretable alternative to modern methods based on proportional hazards. Code for implementing FLEXI-Haz, as well as scripts for reproducing data analyses and simulations, is available at: https://github.com/AsafBanana/FLEXI-Haz

*Qitian Lu,Himanshu Sharma,Michael D. Shields,Lukáš Novák*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Physics-informed polynomial chaos expansions (PC^2) are enhanced to improve efficiency, accuracy, and applicability in surrogate modeling for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification. Two methods—SULM solver and D-optimal sampling—are employed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and limitations in surrogate modeling with high-dimensional spaces, limited data, or unrepresentative training data within the PC^2 framework.

Method: The study explores two methods: (1) straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM) for efficient constrained optimization and (2) D-optimal sampling strategy to select informative virtual points for improved accuracy and efficiency.

Result: The integrated enhancements demonstrate improved computational efficiency, accuracy, and stability in high-dimensional uncertainty quantification tasks.

Conclusion: The enhanced PC^2 framework provides better physical interpretability and computational performance, making it more suitable for complex modeling tasks involving high-dimensionality and limited data.

Abstract: Physics-informed polynomial chaos expansions (PC$^2$) provide an efficient physically constrained surrogate modeling framework by embedding governing equations and other physical constraints into the standard data-driven polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and solving via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. This approach improves the physical interpretability of surrogate models while achieving high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$. The proposed methods are integrated into the PC$^2$ framework and evaluated through numerical examples of representative physical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that the enhanced PC$^2$ has better comprehensive capability than standard PC$^2$, and is well-suited for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification tasks.

*Gonzalo Mateos,Yanning Shen,Georgios B. Giannakis,Ananthram Swami*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper surveys methods for identifying and analyzing graph topologies, with a focus on both undirected and directed networks, dynamic dependencies, and higher-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in analyzing complex relationships in multidimensional networks, relevant in fields like neuroscience, transportation, and finance.

Method: The chapter discusses a range of methods, including correlation and covariance metrics for undirected graphs, kernel-based frameworks for nonlinear and directional relationships, and structural equation modeling for dynamic topologies.

Result: It demonstrates that the methods discussed are capable of handling dynamic, nonlinear, and multidimensional data while ensuring efficient and robust learning.

Conclusion: This approach enables effective graph topology identification and inference, suitable for batch and online learning, leveraging high-order statistics while addressing modern network data's complexity.

Abstract: Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.

### [333] [Universal Hirschberg for Width Bounded Dynamic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10132)
*Logan Nye*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper generalizes Hirschberg's algorithm to dynamic programs on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs), providing space-efficient traceback methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hirschberg's algorithm efficiently reduces space complexity for the longest common subsequence problem. Extending this approach to broader classes of dynamic programs has potential for significant improvements in computational problem-solving.

Method: The authors model dynamic programs as deterministic time evolution over DAGs with bounded local dependencies, constructing a height-compressed recursion tree that enables deterministic traceback. They analyze space complexity bounds and explore recomputation methods.

Result: The paper proves that traceback is achievable in space $O(ω \log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$, yielding near-optimal performance for problems like sequence alignment and bounded pathwidth DP formulations. It identifies inherent $Ω(ω)$ space requirements and conjectures barriers for streaming models.

Conclusion: Space-efficient traceback is shown to be a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs, promising broader applicability beyond grid-based algorithms.

Abstract: Hirschberg's algorithm (1975) reduces the space complexity for the longest common subsequence problem from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ via recursive midpoint bisection on a grid dynamic program (DP). We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small "middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $Ω(ω)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.

*Yongkai Chen,Samuel WK Wong,SC Kou*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework that adapts AlphaFold2 to classify proteins as metamorphic or single-fold by analyzing conformational ensembles, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of AlphaFold2 in predicting structures of metamorphic proteins with multiple conformations, and to develop a method to classify such proteins effectively.

Method: AlphaFold2 was re-purposed to generate conformational ensembles with a multiple sequence alignment sampling method. Features of these ensembles were extracted and used in a random forest classifier trained on a benchmark dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieved a mean AUC of 0.869 via cross-validation and identified new potential metamorphic proteins, including the 40S ribosomal protein S30.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates AI-based prediction with statistical learning to classify metamorphic proteins, enabling discoveries in protein functionality and advancing understanding of molecular functions.

Abstract: The remarkable success of AlphaFold2 in providing accurate atomic-level prediction of protein structures from their amino acid sequence has transformed approaches to the protein folding problem. However, its core paradigm of mapping one sequence to one structure may only be appropriate for single-fold proteins with one stable conformation. Metamorphic proteins, which can adopt multiple distinct conformations, have conformational diversity that cannot be adequately modeled by AlphaFold2. Hence, classifying whether a given protein is metamorphic or single-fold remains a critical challenge for both laboratory experiments and computational methods. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification framework by re-purposing AlphaFold2 to generate conformational ensembles via a multiple sequence alignment sampling method. From these ensembles, we extract a comprehensive set of features characterizing the conformational ensemble's modality and structural dispersion. A random forest classifier trained on a carefully curated benchmark dataset of known metamorphic and single-fold proteins achieves a mean AUC of 0.869 with cross-validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Furthermore, by applying our classifier to 600 randomly sampled proteins from the Protein Data Bank, we identified several potential metamorphic protein candidates -- including the 40S ribosomal protein S30, whose conformational change is crucial for its secondary function in antimicrobial defense. By combining AI-driven protein structure prediction with statistical learning, our work provides a powerful new approach for discovering metamorphic proteins and deepens our understanding of their role in their molecular function.

*Han Chen,Steven Zhu,Yingrui Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: STARS is a transformer-based sequential recommendation framework designed for ecommerce, achieving substantial improvements in recommendation quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient and accurate recommender systems for ecommerce, tackling challenges like cold-start products, user intent dynamics, and low-latency requirements.

Method: The approach introduces STARS, which features dual-memory embeddings, semantic item tokens, context-aware scoring, and a two-stage latency-conscious retrieval pipeline.

Result: STARS showed a 75% improvement in offline Hit@5 metrics and statistically significant lifts in large-scale A/B tests, such as Total Orders (+0.8%) and Visits per User (+0.5%).

Conclusion: The integration of semantic enrichment, multi-intent modeling, and performance optimization enables STARS to achieve state-of-the-art recommendations without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world ecommerce recommender systems must deliver relevant items under strict tens-of-milliseconds latency constraints despite challenges such as cold-start products, rapidly shifting user intent, and dynamic context including seasonality, holidays, and promotions. We introduce STARS, a transformer-based sequential recommendation framework built for large-scale, low-latency ecommerce settings. STARS combines several innovations: dual-memory user embeddings that separate long-term preferences from short-term session intent; semantic item tokens that fuse pretrained text embeddings, learnable deltas, and LLM-derived attribute tags, strengthening content-based matching, long-tail coverage, and cold-start performance; context-aware scoring with learned calendar and event offsets; and a latency-conscious two-stage retrieval pipeline that performs offline embedding generation and online maximum inner-product search with filtering, enabling tens-of-milliseconds response times. In offline evaluations on production-scale data, STARS improves Hit@5 by more than 75 percent relative to our existing LambdaMART system. A large-scale A/B test on 6 million visits shows statistically significant lifts, including Total Orders +0.8%, Add-to-Cart on Home +2.0%, and Visits per User +0.5%. These results demonstrate that combining semantic enrichment, multi-intent modeling, and deployment-oriented design can yield state-of-the-art recommendation quality in real-world environments without sacrificing serving efficiency.

### [336] [The Best of the Two Worlds: Harmonizing Semantic and Hash IDs for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10388)
*Ziwei Liu,Yejing Wang,Qidong Liu,Zijian Zhang,Chong Chen,Wei Huang,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework (\name) combining Semantic IDs (SIDs) and Hash IDs (HIDs) to address performance issues in Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS), especially balancing recommendations for head and tail items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations of traditional SRS using HID embeddings, such as susceptibility to the long-tail problem and challenges in methods utilizing SID embeddings due to collaborative overwhelming.

Method: The approach involves a dual-branch modeling architecture to integrate multi-granular SID semantics with HID’s unique collaborative identity, alongside a dual-level alignment strategy for enhanced knowledge transfer and preference modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items and outperforms existing SRS methodologies.

Conclusion: The integration of SID and HID within \name effectively resolves challenges in SRS, offering a robust and balanced recommendation framework.

Abstract: Conventional Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) typically assign unique Hash IDs (HID) to construct item embeddings. These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines. The implementation code can be found online\footnote{https://github.com/ziwliu8/H2Rec}.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper identifies popularity bias as intrinsic to BPR-based collaborative filtering models and introduces the Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC) framework to mitigate this bias by adjusting embedding geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing popularity bias that undermines CF models' personalization capabilities and disproportionately recommending popular items over niche preferences.

Method: Through mathematical analysis, the authors reveal geometric distortion in BPR optimization and propose the DDC framework. DDC corrects embedding geometry by guiding positive interactions toward personalized preferences and steering negative interactions away from global popularity directions.

Result: DDC significantly outperforms existing debiasing approaches, achieving superior recommendation quality, fairness, and reducing loss to less than 5% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Popularity bias is caused by intrinsic geometric artifacts in BPR optimization. DDC framework efficiently resolves these issues, enhancing personalization, fairness, and overall recommendation quality.

Abstract: Popularity bias fundamentally undermines the personalization capabilities of collaborative filtering (CF) models, causing them to disproportionately recommend popular items while neglecting users' genuine preferences for niche content. While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant "popularity direction" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

### [338] [Deep sets and event-level maximum-likelihood estimation for fast pile-up jet rejection in ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10819)
*Mohammed Aboelela*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: High levels of pile-up at LHC require efficient methods to group jets by their origin. The paper proposes DIPz, a regression model for jet origin determination and an event-level discriminator MLPL for multi-jet pile-up rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increased pile-up during Run 3 and High-Luminosity LHC poses challenges in multijet event analysis. Efficiently determining jet origins is necessary to mitigate the issues at high luminosity and improve event selection.

Method: The proposed methodology involves DIPz, a Deep Sets-based uncertainty-aware jet regression model, to predict jet origin positions using charged particle track inputs, combined with an event-level discriminant MLPL, which is optimized for multi-jet signature selection.

Result: DIPz combined with the MLPL event-level discriminant enhances pile-up rejection at the ATLAS High Level Trigger, enabling computationally efficient and precise event selection in multijet final states.

Conclusion: This approach introduces a novel and robust solution to multijet pile-up issues at high luminosity, proving useful for real-time event selection in high-energy physics experiments like ATLAS.

Abstract: Multiple proton-proton collisions (pile-up) occur at every bunch crossing at the LHC, with the mean number of interactions expected to reach 80 during Run 3 and up to 200 at the High-Luminosity LHC. As a direct consequence, events with multijet signatures will occur at increasingly high rates. To cope with the increased luminosity, being able to efficiently group jets according to their origin along the beamline is crucial, particularly at the trigger level. In this work, a novel uncertainty-aware jet regression model based on a Deep Sets architecture is introduced, DIPz, to regress on a jet origin position along the beamline. The inputs to the DIPz algorithm are the charged particle tracks associated to each jet. An event-level discriminant, the Maximum Log Product of Likelihoods (MLPL), is constructed by combining the DIPz per-jet predictions. MLPL is cut-optimized to select events compatible with targeted multi-jet signature selection. This combined approach provides a robust and computationally efficient method for pile-up rejection in multi-jet final states, applicable to real-time event selections at the ATLAS High Level Trigger.

*Mark Sellke,Steven Yin*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper investigates learning-curve monotonicity, ensuring that algorithms continually improve with more data. It establishes monotonicity guarantees for the maximum likelihood estimator in specific parametric settings like Gaussian vectors and Gamma variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and guarantee monotonicity in algorithms as they process increasing amounts of data, strengthening the reliability of learning algorithms.

Method: The study formulates mathematical guarantees of monotonicity using tools such as sequential prediction with log loss and KL divergence for specific parametric families. All results were derived algorithmically by GPT-5.2 Pro, without human-provided proofs.

Result: Monotonicity is proven for Gaussian vectors (considering unknown covariance), Gamma variables (unknown scale parameters), and general exponential families under reverse KL divergence.

Conclusion: This research advances the theoretical foundation of monotonicity in machine learning algorithms, with computational aid from GPT-5.2 Pro, offering insights into the behavior of widely used statistical methods such as MLE and KL divergence in varied settings.

Abstract: The property of learning-curve monotonicity, highlighted in a recent series of work by Loog, Mey and Viering, describes algorithms which only improve in average performance given more data, for any underlying data distribution within a given family. We establish the first nontrivial monotonicity guarantees for the maximum likelihood estimator in a variety of well-specified parametric settings. For sequential prediction with log loss, we show monotonicity (in fact complete monotonicity) of the forward KL divergence for Gaussian vectors with unknown covariance and either known or unknown mean, as well as for Gamma variables with unknown scale parameter. The Gaussian setting was explicitly highlighted as open in the aforementioned works, even in dimension 1. Finally we observe that for reverse KL divergence, a folklore trick yields monotonicity for very general exponential families.
  All results in this paper were derived by variants of GPT-5.2 Pro. Humans did not provide any proof strategies or intermediate arguments, but only prompted the model to continue developing additional results, and verified and transcribed its proofs.

TL;DR: The paper explores smoothings of the max function in the infinity norm, showing LogSumExp to be optimal up to constant factors but identifies stronger methods in small dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the design of smooth approximations for the max function to achieve optimality in both dimensionality and overestimation bounds.

Method: Elementary construction techniques were used to establish lower bounds and demonstrate optimal smoothing methods for the max function in specific dimensions.

Result: LogSumExp is optimal up to constant factors regarding dimensionality bounds, but exact optimal smoothings were identified for smaller dimensions.

Conclusion: The entropy-based LogSumExp is effective but not perfectly optimal in lower dimensions, suggesting room for improvement in exact smoothings.

Abstract: We consider the design of smoothings of the (coordinate-wise) max function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the infinity norm. The LogSumExp function $f(x)=\ln(\sum^d_i\exp(x_i))$ provides a classical smoothing, differing from the max function in value by at most $\ln(d)$. We provide an elementary construction of a lower bound, establishing that every overestimating smoothing of the max function must differ by at least $\sim 0.8145\ln(d)$. Hence, LogSumExp is optimal up to constant factors. However, in small dimensions, we provide stronger, exactly optimal smoothings attaining our lower bound, showing that the entropy-based LogSumExp approach to smoothing is not exactly optimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring plant health with existing methods is inefficient, and locating sensors in complex agricultural settings poses a major challenge.

Method: The authors created a system combining LiDAR, cameras, and other components to locate reflective sensors in fields and capture hyperspectral imaging data automatically.

Result: Their system successfully located sensors, tracked them, and captured accurate spectral data in controlled environments.

Conclusion: This system demonstrates a scalable and low-cost approach for real-time plant monitoring, improving agricultural sensor usage significantly.

Abstract: Monitoring plant health increasingly relies on leaf-mounted sensors that provide real-time physiological data, yet efficiently locating and sampling these sensors in complex agricultural environments remains a major challenge. We present an integrated, adaptive, and scalable system that autonomously detects and interrogates plant sensors using a coordinated suite of low-cost optical components including a LiDAR, liquid lens, monochrome camera, filter wheel, and Fast Steering Mirror (FSM). The system first uses LiDAR to identify the distinct reflective signatures of sensors within the field, then dynamically redirects the camera s field of view via the FSM to target each sensor for hyperspectral imaging. The liquid lens continuously adjusts focus to maintain image sharpness across varying depths, enabling precise spectral measurements. We validated the system in controlled indoor experiments, demonstrating accurate detection and tracking of reflective plant sensors and successful acquisition of their spectral data. To our knowledge, no other system currently integrates these sensing and optical modalities for agricultural monitoring. This work establishes a foundation for adaptive, low-cost, and automated plant sensor interrogation, representing a significant step toward scalable, real-time plant health monitoring in precision agriculture.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data reduction technique for hyperspectral image endmember extraction that retains essential data, significantly cutting computational time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the high computational cost of self-dictionary methods for endmember extraction, which limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images.

Method: The proposed method involves developing a data reduction technique under the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, followed by integrating this technique into a self-dictionary method using a linear programming formulation.

Result: The results demonstrate that the data reduction preserves endmember-related pixels and significantly reduces computational time without compromising extraction accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed data-reduced self-dictionary method is computationally efficient and maintains high accuracy in endmember extraction from hyperspectral images.

Abstract: Endmember extraction from hyperspectral images aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials present in a scene. Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper enhances ML for inverse medium scattering by integrating explicit physics through a differentiable forward model, leading to efficient and accurate reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse medium scattering is ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it challenging for ML methods due to their poor ability to encode explicit scattering physics.

Method: The authors integrate a differentiable solver for the forward model into ML, refining reconstructions progressively with increasing wave frequencies.

Result: The method achieves high-quality reconstructions with reduced computational and sampling costs compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Incorporating explicit physics into ML improves the performance and efficiency of solving nonlinear inverse medium scattering problems.

Abstract: Inverse medium scattering is an ill-posed, nonlinear wave-based imaging problem arising in medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRACE, a benchmark for evaluating reference-free audio caption alignment, revealing significant limitations in current metrics like CLAPScore and large audio-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio caption evaluation metrics, especially in reference-free settings, lack robustness validation, hindering their reliability in diverse conditions.

Method: BRACE, a benchmarking system, is developed with two sub-benchmarks for accuracy and hallucination detection, supported by LLM-based corruption and human annotation.

Result: CLAPScore achieves 70.01 F1-score on BRACE-Main, and the best LALM scores 63.19, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: The BRACE benchmark highlights weaknesses in existing evaluation metrics and models, offering a basis for advancing audio-language alignment methodologies.

Abstract: Automatic audio captioning is essential for audio understanding, enabling applications such as accessibility and content indexing. However, evaluating the quality of audio captions remains a major challenge, especially in reference-free settings where high-quality ground-truth captions are unavailable. While CLAPScore is currently the most widely used reference-free Audio Caption Evaluation Metric(ACEM), its robustness under diverse conditions has not been systematically validated.
  To address this gap, we introduce BRACE, a new benchmark designed to evaluate audio caption alignment quality in a reference-free setting. BRACE is primarily designed for assessing ACEMs, and can also be extended to measure the modality alignment abilities of Large Audio Language Model(LALM). BRACE consists of two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinated content. We construct these datasets through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation.
  Given the widespread adoption of CLAPScore as a reference-free ACEM and the increasing application of LALMs in audio-language tasks, we evaluate both approaches using the BRACE benchmark, testing CLAPScore across various CLAP model variants and assessing multiple LALMs.
  Notably, even the best-performing CLAP-based ACEM achieves only a 70.01 F1-score on the BRACE-Main benchmark, while the best LALM reaches just 63.19.
  By revealing the limitations of CLAP models and LALMs, our BRACE benchmark offers valuable insights into the direction of future research.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces VocSim, a benchmark for evaluating the intrinsic geometric alignment of frozen embeddings in audio representation, focusing on single-source audio from diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need of quantifying intrinsic quality of general-purpose audio representations for downstream tasks, particularly for zero-shot applications.

Method: VocSim evaluates embeddings using Precision@k for local purity and Global Separation Rate (GSR) for point-wise class separation. It calibrates GSR via a permutation baseline and uses a simple pipeline with foundation models, Whisper encoder features, and label-free PCA.

Result: The results demonstrate strong zero-shot performance of their framework. However, it reveals generalization gaps, particularly with blind, low-resource speech. The paper validates this with state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and domains like avian perceptual similarity and bioacoustics.

Conclusion: VocSim measures intrinsic audio geometric quality, which correlates with utility in diverse downstream applications. The paper also provides a framework with a dataset, code, and leaderboard for standard benchmarking.

Abstract: General-purpose audio representations aim to map acoustically variable instances of the same event to nearby points, resolving content identity in a zero-shot setting. Unlike supervised classification benchmarks that measure adaptability via parameter updates, we introduce VocSim, a training-free benchmark probing the intrinsic geometric alignment of frozen embeddings. VocSim aggregates 125k single-source clips from 19 corpora spanning human speech, animal vocalizations, and environmental sounds. By restricting to single-source audio, we isolate content representation from the confound of source separation. We evaluate embeddings using Precision@k for local purity and the Global Separation Rate (GSR) for point-wise class separation. To calibrate GSR, we report lift over an empirical permutation baseline. Across diverse foundation models, a simple pipeline, frozen Whisper encoder features, time-frequency pooling, and label-free PCA, yields strong zero-shot performance. However, VocSim also uncovers a consistent generalization gap. On blind, low-resource speech, local retrieval drops sharply. While performance remains statistically distinguishable from chance, the absolute geometric structure collapses, indicating a failure to generalize to unseen phonotactics. As external validation, our top embeddings predict avian perceptual similarity, improve bioacoustic classification, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the HEAR benchmark. We posit that the intrinsic geometric quality measured here proxies utility in unlisted downstream applications. We release data, code, and a public leaderboard to standardize the evaluation of intrinsic audio geometry.

### [346] [Semantic-Aware Confidence Calibration for Automated Audio Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10170)
*Lucas Dunker,Sai Akshay Menta,Snigdha Mohana Addepalli,Venkata Krishna Rayalu Garapati*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for improving confidence estimation and semantic accuracy in automated audio captioning models through semantic similarity and a learned confidence prediction method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated audio captioning models often produce overconfident outputs that do not necessarily reflect semantic accuracy, hindering their usability in real-world applications.

Method: The authors integrate confidence prediction into a Whisper-based audio captioning model, use CLAP audio-text embeddings and sentence transformer similarities to redefine evaluation metrics, and compute Expected Calibration Error (ECE) based on semantic correctness.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves calibration (CLAP-based ECE of 0.071 compared to baseline ECE of 0.488) and enhances caption quality across standard metrics on Clotho v2 dataset.

Conclusion: Semantic similarity-based evaluation and confidence calibration are more reliable and meaningful for audio captioning models than traditional surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Automated audio captioning models frequently produce overconfident predictions regardless of semantic accuracy, limiting their reliability in deployment. This deficiency stems from two factors: evaluation metrics based on n-gram overlap that fail to capture semantic correctness, and the absence of calibrated confidence estimation. We present a framework that addresses both limitations by integrating confidence prediction into audio captioning and redefining correctness through semantic similarity. Our approach augments a Whisper-based audio captioning model with a learned confidence prediction head that estimates uncertainty from decoder hidden states. We employ CLAP audio-text embeddings and sentence transformer similarities (FENSE) to define semantic correctness, enabling Expected Calibration Error (ECE) computation that reflects true caption quality rather than surface-level text overlap. Experiments on Clotho v2 demonstrate that confidence-guided beam search with semantic evaluation achieves dramatically improved calibration (CLAP-based ECE of 0.071) compared to greedy decoding baselines (ECE of 0.488), while simultaneously improving caption quality across standard metrics. Our results establish that semantic similarity provides a more meaningful foundation for confidence calibration in audio captioning than traditional n-gram metrics.

*Wenye Zhu,Jun Tang,Xiaofei Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a CNN-based method to improve Personal Sound Zone (PSZ) systems for customized, cost-effective sound reproduction in virtual reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve PSZ reproduction systems for practical use while reducing cost and inconvenience tied to fixed receiver arrays in current methods.

Method: The paper employs a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) which replaces traditional fixed infrastructures by learning from virtual target scenes to generate pre-filters for PSZs.

Result: The CNN approach outperforms traditional methods by offering greater flexibility with reproduction targets and control point grids while requiring only one training session.

Conclusion: The method introduces a practical and efficient solution for PSZ systems in virtual reality, capable of learning spatial details effectively even with sparse data points.

Abstract: Personal sound zone (PSZ) reproduction system, which attempts to create distinct virtual acoustic scenes for different listeners at their respective positions within the same spatial area using one loudspeaker array, is a fundamental technology in the application of virtual reality. For practical applications, the reconstruction targets must be measured on the same fixed receiver array used to record the local room impulse responses (RIRs) from the loudspeaker array to the control points in each PSZ, which makes the system inconvenient and costly for real-world use. In this paper, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for PSZ reproduction with flexible control microphone grid and alternative reproduction target is presented, utilizing the virtual target scene as inputs and the PSZ pre-filters as output. Experimental results of the proposed method are compared with the traditional method, demonstrating that the proposed method is able to handle varied reproduction targets on flexible control point grid using only one training session. Furthermore, the proposed method also demonstrates the capability to learn global spatial information from sparse sampling points distributed in PSZs.

Conclusion: QFLchain enhances model training efficiency, addresses key challenges in 6G, and provides a secure, decentralized solution by merging QFL with blockchain.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is emerging as a key enabler for intelligent, secure, and privacy-preserving model training in next-generation 6G networks. By leveraging the computational advantages of quantum devices, QFL offers significant improvements in learning efficiency and resilience against quantum-era threats. However, future 6G environments are expected to be highly dynamic, decentralized, and data-intensive, which necessitates moving beyond traditional centralized federated learning frameworks. To meet this demand, blockchain technology provides a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure capable of enabling trustless collaboration among distributed quantum edge devices. This paper presents QFLchain, a novel framework that integrates QFL with blockchain to support scalable and secure 6G intelligence. In this work, we investigate four key pillars of \textit{QFLchain} in the 6G context: (i) communication and consensus overhead, (ii) scalability and storage overhead, (iii) energy inefficiency, and (iv) security vulnerability. A case study is also presented, demonstrating potential advantages of QFLchain, based on simulation, over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of training performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper systematically evaluates the practical performance of zk-SNARKs (Groth16) and zk-STARKs on an ARM platform, comparing their proof generation time, verification latency, and proof size. Results show significant trade-offs between the two systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between the well-studied theoretical aspects of zero-knowledge proof systems and their underexplored practical performance, emphasizing their utility under real-world conditions.

Method: The study uses a systematic, implementation-level comparison of zk-SNARKs (Groth16) and zk-STARKs, leveraging publicly available reference implementations and consumer-grade ARM platforms for empirical evaluation.

Result: zk-SNARKs are found to be significantly faster in proof generation (68x) and produce much smaller proofs (123x smaller). However, they verify slower and require a trusted setup. In contrast, zk-STARKs have larger proofs, slower generation times but verify faster and are transparent as well as post-quantum secure.

Conclusion: The findings highlight distinct performance trade-offs and computational bottlenecks in zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, providing actionable insights for optimizing and selecting proof systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are central to secure and privacy-preserving computation, with zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs emerging as leading frameworks offering distinct trade-offs in efficiency, scalability, and trust assumptions. While their theoretical foundations are well studied, practical performance under real-world conditions remains less understood.
  In this work, we present a systematic, implementation-level comparison of zk-SNARKs (Groth16) and zk-STARKs using publicly available reference implementations on a consumer-grade ARM platform. Our empirical evaluation covers proof generation time, verification latency, proof size, and CPU profiling. Results show that zk-SNARKs generate proofs 68x faster with 123x smaller proof size, but verify slower and require trusted setup, whereas zk-STARKs, despite larger proofs and slower generation, verify faster and remain transparent and post-quantum secure. Profiling further identifies distinct computational bottlenecks across the two systems, underscoring how execution models and implementation details significantly affect real-world performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security challenges and vulnerabilities posed by co-location attacks in serverless computing, highlighting the insufficiencies in current scheduling algorithms.

Method: The authors present a methodology for identifying exploitable features in scheduling algorithms, conduct experiments on open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure, and propose mitigation strategies.

Result: The experiments demonstrate successful instance co-location attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in serverless schedulers. The study identifies weaknesses in widely used infrastructures and highlights exploitable features.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the need for enhanced security in serverless scheduling mechanisms and provides actionable mitigation strategies to bolster cloud computing environments against co-location threats.

Abstract: Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud computing by offering an efficient and cost-effective way for users to develop and deploy applications without managing infrastructure details. However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.

*Yash Srivastava,Shalin Jain,Sneha Awathare,Nitin Awathare*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized data marketplace called 'Prot,' integrating federated learning, blockchain, and incentives into a secure framework for privacy-preserving data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing systems like federated learning and blockchain-based frameworks in achieving robust, private, and efficient collaborative data-sharing solutions.

Method: Developed 'Prot' to combine blockchain for auction and arbitration, off-chain distributed execution layers for training tasks, and incentive-compatible protocols to ensure honest participation.

Result: 'Prot' achieves high accuracy on benchmark datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), shows robustness against adversarial behavior, and demonstrates efficient scalability.

Conclusion: 'Prot' establishes a practical solution for decentralized data sharing that ensures privacy, robustness, and incentive alignment, applicable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rising demand for collaborative machine learning and data analytics calls for secure and decentralized data sharing frameworks that balance privacy, trust, and incentives. Existing approaches, including federated learning (FL) and blockchain-based data markets, fall short: FL often depends on trusted aggregators and lacks Byzantine robustness, while blockchain frameworks struggle with computation-intensive training and incentive integration.
  We present \prot, a decentralized data marketplace that unifies federated learning, blockchain arbitration, and economic incentives into a single framework for privacy-preserving data sharing. \prot\ enables data buyers to submit bid-based requests via blockchain smart contracts, which manage auctions, escrow, and dispute resolution. Computationally intensive training is delegated to \cone\ (\uline{Co}mpute \uline{N}etwork for \uline{E}xecution), an off-chain distributed execution layer. To safeguard against adversarial behavior, \prot\ integrates a modified YODA protocol with exponentially growing execution sets for resilient consensus, and introduces Corrected OSMD to mitigate malicious or low-quality contributions from sellers. All protocols are incentive-compatible, and our game-theoretic analysis establishes honesty as the dominant strategy.
  We implement \prot\ on Ethereum and evaluate it over benchmark datasets -- MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 -- under varying adversarial settings. \prot\ achieves up to 99\% accuracy on MNIST and 90\% on Fashion-MNIST, with less than 3\% degradation up to 30\% Byzantine nodes, and 56\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 despite its complexity. Our results show that \prot\ ensures privacy, maintains robustness under adversarial conditions, and scales efficiently with the number of participants, making it a practical foundation for real-world decentralized data sharing.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-layer IoT, Edge, and Cloud architecture for emergency healthcare, integrating differential privacy frameworks, noise mechanisms, and blockchain security to enhance response speed and data privacy while reducing latency and increasing algorithm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing real-time responsiveness and robust data privacy in data-driven healthcare applications, particularly in emergency scenarios.

Method: A multi-layer architecture is introduced with task distribution based on criticality and storage permanence. It employs a Differential Privacy framework for machine learning models, evaluates noise mechanisms, and integrates blockchain security and edge computing for better performance.

Result: The hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism provided balanced trade-offs in privacy and utility, with 82-84% model accuracy and significant reductions in inference attacks and data reconstruction risks. Edge computing reduced latency by 8× in emergency contexts.

Conclusion: The architecture validates improved emergency responses, enhanced privacy protection, and reduced latency, proving its effectiveness in advancing secure and efficient healthcare applications.

Abstract: Healthcare has become exceptionally sophisticated, as wearables and connected medical devices are revolutionising remote patient monitoring, emergency response, medication management, diagnosis, and predictive and prescriptive analytics. Internet of Things and Cloud computing integrated systems (IoT-Cloud) facilitate sensing, automation, and processing for these healthcare applications. While real-time response is crucial for alleviating patient emergencies, protecting patient privacy is extremely important in data-driven healthcare. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer IoT, Edge and Cloud architecture to enhance the speed of response for emergency healthcare by distributing tasks based on response criticality and permanence of storage. Privacy of patient data is assured by proposing a Differential Privacy framework across several machine learning models such as K-means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We establish a comprehensive threat model identifying three adversary classes and evaluate Laplace, Gaussian, and hybrid noise mechanisms across varying privacy budgets, with supervised algorithms achieving up to 86% accuracy. The proposed hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism with adaptive budget allocation provides a balanced approach, offering moderate tails and better privacy-utility trade-offs for both low and high dimension datasets. At the practical threshold of $\varepsilon = 5.0$, supervised algorithms achieve 82-84% accuracy while reducing attribute inference attacks by up to 18% and data reconstruction correlation by 70%. Blockchain security further ensures trusted communication through time-stamping, traceability, and immutability for analytics applications. Edge computing demonstrates 8$\times$ latency reduction for emergency scenarios, validating the hierarchical architecture for time-critical operations.

*Chaomeng Lu,Bert Lagaisse*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study evaluates the real-world effectiveness of DL-based vulnerability detection models, revealing poor generalization and performance declines on time-wise out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the gap between strong benchmark performance of DL-based models and their real-world effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities.

Method: The researchers tested two DL models (ReVeal and LineVul) and deployed pretrained LLMs on both benchmark datasets and a new dataset, VentiVul. Code representations were analyzed using t-SNE.

Result: The DL models struggle to generalize across datasets and fail to reliably detect vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios as seen in the decline on VentiVul.

Conclusion: Current models are inadequate for real-world applicability in vulnerability detection, necessitating better code representations, robust models, and high-quality datasets.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection methods based on deep learning (DL) have shown strong performance on benchmark datasets, yet their real-world effectiveness remains underexplored. Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets. These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns. To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSCRD, a protocol designed to improve decentralization and fair reward distribution in cross-chain communication, addressing centralization and single-point-of-failure risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce centralization and single-point-of-failure risks in single-bridge blockchain solutions, and to incentivize sustained participation and honest behavior in cross-chain communication.

Method: Development of the Proof of Success and Reward Distribution (PSCRD) protocol, which coordinates responses among multiple bridges and equitably distributes fees as incentives, promoting higher decentralization.

Result: Analysis and simulations show improved fairness in reward distribution (using the Gini index) and increased decentralization (using the Nakamoto coefficient) over time without higher user costs.

Conclusion: PSCRD enhances the resilience and security of cross-chain communication systems by promoting decentralization and equitable rewards, mitigating risks associated with single-bridge solutions.

Abstract: Single-bridge blockchain solutions enable cross-chain communication. However, they are associated with centralization and single-point-of-failure risks. This paper proposes Proof of Success and Reward Distribution (PSCRD), a novel multi-bridge response coordination and incentive distribution protocol designed to address the challenges. PSCRD introduces a fair reward distribution system that equitably distributes the transfer fee among participating bridges, incentivizing honest behavior and sustained commitment. The purpose is to encourage bridge participation for higher decentralization and lower single-point-of-failure risks. The mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of PSCRD using two key metrics: the Gini index, which demonstrates a progressive improvement in the fairness of the reward distribution as new bridge groups joined the network; and the Nakamoto coefficient, which shows a significant improvement in decentralization over time. These findings highlight that PSCRD provides a more resilient and secure cross-chain bridge system without substantially increasing user costs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents TriHaRd, a protocol for establishing a trustworthy time source in TEEs, addressing vulnerabilities in existing methods (like Triad) against clock speed manipulation attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve the issue of malicious manipulations of time in TEEs, which can undermine the system's reliability and create vulnerabilities for protocols relying on a trusted time source.

Method: The authors propose TriHaRd, introducing Byzantine-resilient clock updates and consistency checks to counteract clock manipulation attacks and maintain the integrity of time-related computations in TEEs.

Result: The proposed TriHaRd protocol successfully mitigates known attacks on Triad, demonstrated through empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: TriHaRd enhances resilience in TEEs by addressing clock speed and time offset manipulations, providing a more robust and secure trusted time protocol.

Abstract: Accurately measuring time passing is critical for many applications. However, in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, the time source is outside the Trusted Computing Base: a malicious host can manipulate the TEE's notion of time, jumping in time or affecting perceived time speed. Previous work (Triad) proposes protocols for TEEs to maintain a trustworthy time source by building a cluster of TEEs that collaborate with each other and with a remote Time Authority to maintain a continuous notion of passing time. However, such approaches still allow an attacker to control the operating system and arbitrarily manipulate their own TEE's perceived clock speed. An attacker can even propagate faster passage of time to honest machines participating in Triad's trusted time protocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future. We propose TriHaRd, a TEE trusted time protocol achieving high resilience against clock speed and offset manipulations, notably through Byzantine-resilient clock updates and consistency checks. We empirically show that TriHaRd mitigates known attacks against Triad.

*Yangkun Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new watermarking method for language models that balances robustness, efficiency, and undetectability using probabilistic automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking schemes for language models struggle with balancing robustness, detection overhead, and undetectability from adversaries.

Method: The paper proposes a watermarking approach using probabilistic automata with two main designs: one focusing on practicality with high generation diversity and efficiency, and another offering cryptographically backed undetectability.

Result: Experiments on language models like LLaMA-3B and Mistral-7B demonstrate improved robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed schemes.

Conclusion: The new watermarking schemes provide an effective solution for embedding undetectable and robust watermarks into language models, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: A recent watermarking scheme for language models achieves distortion-free embedding and robustness to edit-distance attacks. However, it suffers from limited generation diversity and high detection overhead. In parallel, recent research has focused on undetectability, a property ensuring that watermarks remain difficult for adversaries to detect and spoof. In this work, we introduce a new class of watermarking schemes constructed through probabilistic automata. We present two instantiations: (i) a practical scheme with exponential generation diversity and computational efficiency, and (ii) a theoretical construction with formal undetectability guarantees under cryptographic assumptions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-3B and Mistral-7B validate the superior performance of our scheme in terms of robustness and efficiency.

*Mohammad M Maheri,Sunil Cotterill,Alex Davidson,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Machine unlearning removes specific data's influence from models. ZK APEX achieves efficient verifiable personalized unlearning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of verifying personalized unlearning transformations in edge devices without retraining and without revealing private data.

Method: ZK APEX utilizes sparse masking, blockwise empirical Fisher matrix updates, and zero-knowledge proofs to enable efficient, curvature-aware unlearning.

Result: ZK APEX maintains personalized model accuracy after unlearning, removes targeted data influence, and drastically reduces computational and memory overhead compared to retraining.

Conclusion: The paper establishes ZK APEX as the first practical framework for verifiable personalized unlearning on edge devices, offering efficiency and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model to satisfy privacy, copyright, and safety requirements. In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.
  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.
  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes. These results show the first practical framework for verifiable personalized unlearning on edge devices.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph Neural Network framework to address evolving IAM threats by learning user-resource patterns, proving more effective than traditional and baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing complexity of cloud infrastructures and IAM systems, novel threats remain undetected by traditional rule/signature-based security models, necessitating advanced detection strategies.

Method: The researchers proposed modeling IAM audit trails as dynamic heterogeneous graphs, integrating attention-based algorithms and embeddings for real-time adaptive threat detection.

Result: The model shows higher detection accuracy (precision and recall) than baseline approaches (LSTM, GCN), while ensuring scalability across cloud environments.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework enhances security intelligence for cloud systems by proactively detecting insider threats and other attacks, making progress towards AI-driven zero trust access analytics.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cloud infrastructures and distributed identity systems has significantly increased the complexity and attack surface of modern enterprises. Traditional rule based or signature driven detection systems are often inadequate in identifying novel or evolving threats within Identity and Access Management logs, where anomalous behavior may appear statistically benign but contextually malicious. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework designed to learn latent user resource interaction patterns from IAM audit trails in real time. By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments. The frameworks adaptability enables proactive mitigation of insider threats, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, contributing to the foundation of AI driven zero trust access analytics. This work bridges the gap between graph based machine learning and operational cloud security intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLARE, a novel framework for inferring FL model architectures like CNNs or RNNs by analyzing encrypted wireless traffic, achieving high accuracy in closed-world (98%) and open-world (91%) settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) systems protect user privacy but are vulnerable to privacy threats related to inferring the architecture of FL models, which can lead to tailored attacks.

Method: FLARE leverages flow-level and packet-level statistics from encrypted Wi-Fi traffic to perform side-channel fingerprinting, identifying FL model architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).

Result: FLARE demonstrated effective architecture fingerprinting with over 98% F1-score in closed-world scenarios and up to 91% in open-world setups, using various CNN and RNN architectures in realistic FL settings.

Conclusion: This work highlights a critical side-channel vulnerability in FL systems, revealing that FL model architectures can be inferred via encrypted wireless traffic patterns, posing privacy risks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while safeguarding data and user privacy. However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this is the first work to fingerprint FL model architectures by sniffing encrypted wireless traffic, exposing a critical side-channel vulnerability in current FL systems.

### [361] [Metaphor-based Jailbreaking Attacks on Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10766)
*Chenyu Zhang,Yiwen Ma,Lanjun Wang,Wenhui Li,Yi Tu,An-An Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents MJA, a metaphor-based jailbreaking attack method for text-to-image models, bypassing various defense mechanisms by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts without prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attack methods rely on the assumption that attackers know the type of deployed defenses, making them less effective against unknown or varied defense mechanisms. The authors aim to develop a more robust approach.

Method: MJA, inspired by the Taboo game, uses a two-module system: (1) MLAG (multi-agent generation module) to generate metaphor-based prompts through metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation; and (2) APO (adversarial prompt optimization module) to enhance efficiency by training a surrogate model and optimizing prompt selection.

Result: MJA outperforms six baseline methods in attacking T2I models with varied defenses, achieving stronger performance and requiring fewer queries.

Conclusion: MJA demonstrates robust and efficient prompt generation, revealing vulnerabilities in T2I models' safety mechanisms, and contributes to advancing understanding of defense bypassing techniques.

Abstract: Text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attacks have shown that adversarial prompts can effectively bypass these mechanisms and induce T2I models to produce sensitive content, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing attack methods implicitly assume that the attacker knows the type of deployed defenses, which limits their effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

*Han Yang,Shaofeng Li,Tian Dong,Xiangyu Xu,Guangchi Liu,Zhen Ling*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study presents the 'Authority Backdoor' framework to proactively safeguard deep neural networks (DNNs) by embedding an access control mechanism and ensuring robustness against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for protecting DNN intellectual property, such as digital watermarking, only enable post-hoc ownership verification and cannot prevent unauthorized model use. Hence, there is a need for active protection mechanisms.

Method: The 'Authority Backdoor' embeds access constraints in DNNs via a backdoor learning framework, locking model functionality. The model operates normally only under certain conditions, such as the presence of a specific hardware trigger, while including certifiable robustness to resist attacker manipulation.

Result: The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the framework across various DNN architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a secure mechanism for DNNs that combines proactive access control with certifiable robustness, mitigating risks of unauthorized model use.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), as valuable intellectual property, face unauthorized use. Existing protections, such as digital watermarking, are largely passive; they provide only post-hoc ownership verification and cannot actively prevent the illicit use of a stolen model. This work proposes a proactive protection scheme, dubbed ``Authority Backdoor," which embeds access constraints directly into the model. In particular, the scheme utilizes a backdoor learning framework to intrinsically lock a model's utility, such that it performs normally only in the presence of a specific trigger (e.g., a hardware fingerprint). But in its absence, the DNN's performance degrades to be useless. To further enhance the security of the proposed authority scheme, the certifiable robustness is integrated to prevent an adaptive attacker from removing the implanted backdoor. The resulting framework establishes a secure authority mechanism for DNNs, combining access control with certifiable robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on diverse architectures and datasets validate the effectiveness and certifiable robustness of the proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS systems rely on outdated signature-based methods and struggle with dynamic and novel cyber threats in evolving 5G/6G networks.

Method: The paper proposes a new IDS framework utilizing adversarial training to resist poisoned data and dynamic neural networks with incremental learning algorithms to reduce retraining and enhance detection capabilities.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 82.33% multiclass classification accuracy on the NSL-KDD dataset while maintaining resistance against data poisoning.

Conclusion: Adversarial trained and dynamic neural network-based IDS systems are effective and resilient solutions for protecting 5G/6G networks from evolving cyber threats.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical components in safeguarding 5G/6G networks from both internal and external cyber threats. While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Unlike conventional models, which require costly retraining to update knowledge, the proposed framework integrates incremental learning algorithms, reducing the need for frequent retraining. Adversarial training is used to fortify the IDS against poisoned data. By using fewer features and incorporating statistical properties, the system can efficiently detect potential threats. Extensive evaluations using the NSL- KDD dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy of 82.33% for multiclass classification of various network attacks while resisting dataset poisoning. This research highlights the potential of adversarial-trained, dynamic neural networks for building resilient IDS solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges posed by video injection attacks, such as deepfakes and virtual camera exploits, which threaten the integrity of facial recognition-based biometric systems.

Method: The authors developed and trained a machine learning algorithm using session metadata from authentic users for virtual camera detection.

Result: The proposed model effectively identifies video injection attempts, enhancing the security of face anti-spoofing systems against malicious actors.

Conclusion: Machine learning-based virtual camera detection proves to be a robust tool in reducing the vulnerability of biometric authentication systems to sophisticated video injection attacks.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is a vital component of remote biometric authentication systems based on facial recognition, increasingly used across web-based applications. Among emerging threats, video injection attacks -- facilitated by technologies such as deepfakes and virtual camera software -- pose significant challenges to system integrity. While virtual camera detection (VCD) has shown potential as a countermeasure, existing literature offers limited insight into its practical implementation and evaluation. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach to VCD, with a focus on its design and validation. The model is trained on metadata collected during sessions with authentic users. Empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying video injection attempts and reducing the risk of malicious users bypassing FAS systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the BOLS test statistic for causal inference in adaptive experiments, addressing challenges posed by heteroskedasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive experiments are increasingly used but pose significant challenges for causal inference, creating a need for statistical methods that address such issues.

Method: The proposed BOLS test statistic aggregates per-period treatment-control differences using a normalized average of heteroskedastic per-period z-statistics.

Result: Simulation results illustrate the BOLS test's effectiveness in scenarios with few treatment periods and varying batch sizes.

Conclusion: The BOLS test statistic provides a robust approach to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for treatment effects in adaptive experimental designs.

Abstract: The advantages of adaptive experiments have led to their rapid adoption in economics, other fields, as well as among practitioners. However, adaptive experiments pose challenges for causal inference. This note suggests a BOLS (batched ordinary least squares) test statistic for inference of treatment effects in adaptive experiments. The statistic provides a precision-equalizing aggregation of per-period treatment-control differences under heteroskedasticity. The combined test statistic is a normalized average of heteroskedastic per-period z-statistics and can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We provide simulation results comparing rejection rates in the typical case with few treatment periods and few (or many) observations per batch.

*Kaiyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper explores improving fake news detection using graph-theoretic metrics alongside embeddings, enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges posed by misinformation and inefficiencies in current graph-level representation methods for fake-news detection.

Method: Enhancing node embeddings with degree centrality and local clustering coefficients in addition to existing BERT and profile embeddings.

Result: Macro F1 performance improved from 0.7753 to 0.8344 on the Politifact dataset.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating graph topology features improves accuracy in fake news detection and offers a reproducible framework for other domains.

Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news has posed serious threats to individuals and society, spurring intense research into automated detection methods. Previous work showed that integrating content, user preferences, and propagation structure achieves strong performance, but leaves all graph-level representation learning entirely to the GNN, hiding any explicit topological cues. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline. Our study not only demonstrates the practical value of explicit topology features in fake-news detection but also provides an interpretable, easily reproducible template for fusing graph metrics in other information-diffusion tasks.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how incorporating task-specific geometric biases into quantum circuit design improves hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs), demonstrating substantial benefits in geometric graph generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in quantum computing literature that rarely considers domain-specific and task-specific quantum circuit designs, focusing instead on generic architectures.

Method: The study incorporates geometric priors into quantum circuit design for QuGANs, evaluates various entanglement topologies and loss-function designs on K4 graph generation, and explores architectural trade-offs like gate types, regularization, and scaling.

Result: Task-aware circuit topology aligned with problem structure leads to significant improvements. The Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the best geometric validity among quantum models and matches classical GAN performance.

Conclusion: Structured, domain-specific quantum circuit designs can enhance solution quality and performance, emphasizing the importance of tailored quantum ansatz-topologies for specific tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises theoretical advantages, benefiting computational problems that would not be efficiently classically simulatable. However, much of this theoretical speedup depends on the quantum circuit design solving the problem. We argue that QC literature has yet to explore more domain specific ansatz-topologies, instead of relying on generic, one-size-fits-all architectures. In this work, we show that incorporating task-specific inductive biases -- specifically geometric priors -- into quantum circuit design can enhance the performance of hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs) on the task of generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs. We evaluate a portfolio of entanglement topologies and loss-function designs to assess their impact on both statistical fidelity and compliance with geometric constraints, including the Triangle and Ptolemaic inequalities. Our results show that aligning circuit topology with the underlying problem structure yields substantial benefits: the Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the highest geometric validity among quantum models and matches the performance of classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Additionally, we showcase how specific architectural choices, such as entangling gate types, variance regularization and output-scaling govern the trade-off between geometric consistency and distributional accuracy, thus emphasizing the value of structured, task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the struggle of traditional algorithms in solving large-scale TSP instances under real-world logistical constraints using quantum optimization techniques.

Method: The paper utilizes a QUBO-based TSP representation compatible with quantum systems. It introduces Clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), which integrates classical machine learning to divide larger problems into smaller sub-problems for better scalability.

Result: Experimental evaluations in high-performance computing simulations show insights into QAOA's effectiveness and limitations across varying problem sizes and hardware constraints.

Conclusion: QAOA offers potential for solving constrained TSP problems, especially with the proposed Cl-QAOA, paving the way for scalable quantum optimization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications.

### [369] [Noisy Quantum Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for understanding quantum learning in noisy experiments, examining how noise impacts quantum computational advantages and proposing new insights into noise-resilient techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to explore the limits of quantum learning in noisy environments, particularly fault-tolerant quantum computers interacting with uncharacterized systems.

Method: The paper models noisy quantum computers as the complexity class "NBQP" and explores oracle problems, learning tasks like purity testing, AdS/CFT-inspired settings, and Pauli shadow tomography under noise.

Result: Noise significantly affects quantum learning advantages, collapsing exponential gains in some cases while preserving superpolynomial separations in others. Lower bounds and algorithms for noisy Pauli tomography provide practical insights.

Conclusion: The advantages of quantum learning are highly sensitive to noise, requiring robust structures and new techniques to achieve meaningful results in noisy experimental settings.

Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.

TL;DR: This paper presents a stochastic MPC framework using conformal prediction for linear systems with probabilistic constraints and unknown disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing stochastic MPC methods that rely on restrictive assumptions (e.g., Gaussian distribution) and expensive offline computations.

Method: The method uses conformal prediction to create confidence regions for stochastic error trajectories, ensuring probabilistic constraints are satisfied with minimal computation. Recursive feasibility and chance constraint satisfaction are proven.

Result: The proposed method satisfies joint chance constraints and ensures recursive feasibility in both state and output feedback settings. Numerical results highlight its effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides a practical and computationally efficient solution for stochastic MPC with unknown disturbance distributions, overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: This work presents a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems subject to joint-in-time chance constraints under unknown disturbance distributions. Unlike existing stochastic MPC formulations that rely on parametric or Gaussian assumptions or require expensive offline computations, the proposed method leverages conformal prediction (CP) as a streamlined tool to construct finite-sample confidence regions for the system's stochastic error trajectories with minimal computational effort. These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage framework to translate informal mathematical proofs into formal proofs in Lean4, using an intermediate representation for better alignment and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4, which is difficult due to the need for explicit representation and domain-specific knowledge in formal systems.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: first, they extract a Chain of States (CoS) to align intermediate formal proof states with informal arguments, and second, they generate tactics to transition between these states to form the complete formal proof.

Result: The proposed method shows a significant increase in proof success rates compared to existing baselines, as evidenced by empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Using the two-stage CoS-based framework helps simplify tactic generation, aligns with informal reasoning patterns, and effectively improves the performance of translating informal proofs into formal proofs.

Abstract: We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-Auction, a novel learning-based generative auction mechanism for efficiently integrating advertising within large language model (LLM) outputs, addressing challenges in LLM-native advertising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in monetizing LLMs through native advertising, which involves integrating ads within LLM-generated responses, requiring novel auction mechanisms that account for complex externalities.

Method: The proposed method, LLM-Auction, integrates auction mechanisms directly with LLM generation through the Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization algorithm, aligning allocation optimization with LLM outputs and modeling externalities without additional computational costs.

Result: The results show that LLM-Auction outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency while maintaining desired mechanism properties like monotonicity and continuity, proven through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: LLM-Auction is a pioneering framework in LLM-native advertising that efficiently combines auction and generation processes, providing competitive performance and better alignment between advertisers' objectives and user experience.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates novel monetization strategies, among which LLM-native advertising has emerged as a promising paradigm by naturally integrating advertisement within LLM-generated responses. However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties.

While LLMs can produce effective feedback for relatively straightforward conceptual tasks, delivering high-quality feedback for tasks that require advanced domain expertise, such as physics problem solving, remains a substantial challenge. This study presents the design of an LLM-based feedback system for physics problem solving grounded in evidence-centered design (ECD) and evaluates its performance within the German Physics Olympiad. Participants assessed the usefulness and accuracy of the generated feedback, which was generally perceived as useful and highly accurate. However, an in-depth analysis revealed that the feedback contained factual errors in 20% of cases; errors that often went unnoticed by the students. We discuss the risks associated with uncritical reliance on LLM-based feedback systems and outline potential directions for generating more adaptive and reliable LLM-based feedback in the future.

### [376] [Natural Language Interface for Firewall Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10789)
*F. Taghiyev,A. Aslanbayli*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a prototype tool for managing firewall configurations through a natural language interface, translating plain language policies into device-specific configurations with validation steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify enterprise firewall management by allowing administrators to describe policies in plain language, reducing the complexity and vendor dependency.

Method: This approach uses assistive large language models to convert plain language descriptions into typed intermediate representations, which can compile into device-specific configurations. Validation layers ensure safety and integrity.

Result: The prototype successfully compiles plain language policies into vendor-specific syntax (Palo Alto PAN OS) and integrates validations that check structural compliance, policy safety, and syntactic accuracy against network models.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates potential as a scalable and auditable solution for simplifying and improving firewall policy management while maintaining human-centered usability and safety measures.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and prototype implementation of a natural language interface for configuring enterprise firewalls. The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management.

### [377] [A Differentiable Digital Twin of Distributed Link Scheduling for Contention-Aware Networking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10874)
*Zhongyuan Zhao,Yujun Ming,Kevin Chan,Ananthram Swami,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Routing and flow optimization in wireless multi-hop networks faces challenges such as nonlinear link capacities due to contention. This paper introduces a Network Digital Twin (NDT) using analytical models and iterative procedures to predict link duty cycles and optimize scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiencies in solving routing and flow optimization problems for wireless multi-hop networks, where traditional minimum cost flow formulations fail due to dynamic link capacities and contention.

Method: The paper employs an analytical network digital twin framework using weighted Luby's algorithm and iterative methods to model link duty cycles under randomized medium access control.

Result: The proposed NDT achieves accurate prediction of link duty cycles and congestion, demonstrating up to 5000x speedup compared to packet-level simulation.

Conclusion: This method provides a powerful tool for optimizing wireless network operations, reducing congestion and radio footprint through effective link scheduling driven by the analytical NDT model.

Abstract: Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.

### [378] [Residual subspace evolution strategies for nonlinear inverse problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10325)
*Francesco Alemanno*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents Residual Subspace Evolution Strategies (RSES), a new derivative-free solver for nonlinear inverse problems, which addresses challenges like noise, non-differentiability, and cost of residual evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing solvers like reliance on Jacobians, preconditioning, or smoothness/covariance assumptions that struggle with noisy or non-differentiable nonlinear inverse problems.

Method: The RSES approach involves sampling Gaussian probes, constructing a surrogate model from residual differences, and an optimal least-squares update without requiring Jacobians or covariances. It is computationally efficient with reduced evaluations and low overhead.

Result: RSES achieves robust misfit reduction on various problem types and outperforms or matches existing methods like xNES, NEWUOA, and EKI under comparable evaluation budgets, particularly in challenging setups.

Conclusion: RSES is a competitive and effective derivative-free solver that addresses weaknesses of previous tools, making it suitable for both smooth and non-smooth inverse problems.

Abstract: Nonlinear inverse problems often feature noisy, non-differentiable, or expensive residual evaluations that make Jacobian-based solvers unreliable. Popular derivative-free optimizers such as natural evolution strategies (NES) or Powell's NEWUOA still assume smoothness or expend many evaluations to maintain stability. Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) relies on empirical covariances that require preconditioning and scale poorly with residual dimension.
  We introduce residual subspace evolution strategies (RSES), a derivative-free solver that samples Gaussian probes around the current iterate, builds a residual-only surrogate from their differences, and recombines the probes through a least-squares solve yielding an optimal update without forming Jacobians or covariances. Each iteration costs $k+1$ residual evaluations, where $k \ll n$ for $n$-dimensional problems, with $O(k^3)$ linear algebra overhead.
  Benchmarks on calibration, regression, and deconvolution problems demonstrate consistent misfit reduction in both deterministic and stochastic settings. RSES matches or surpasses xNES and NEWUOA while staying competitive with EKI under matched evaluation budgets, particularly when smoothness or covariance assumptions fail.

### [379] [Distributionally Robust Regret Optimal Control Under Moment-Based Ambiguity Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10906)
*Feras Al Taha,Eilyan Bitar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses linear-quadratic stochastic control problems with unknown noise distributions by designing robust control policies and solving them with scalable optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to design control policies for situations where the noise distribution in stochastic systems is ambiguous, ensuring robustness against worst-case scenarios.

Method: The authors explore causal affine control policies that minimize worst-case expected regret within an ambiguity set of distributions. They reformulate the problem as a convex program and provide a scalable dual projected subgradient method for solving it.

Result: The proposed approach overcomes computational challenges by avoiding the poor scaling issues of semidefinite programming and achieves competitive performance, as demonstrated in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Scalable and robust control policies can be developed for linear-quadratic stochastic control problems with ambiguity in noise distributions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for such settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of finite-horizon, linear-quadratic stochastic control problems, where the probability distribution governing the noise process is unknown but assumed to belong to an ambiguity set consisting of all distributions whose mean and covariance lie within norm balls centered at given nominal values. To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy. Numerical experiments are presented to benchmark the proposed method against state-of-the-art data-driven and distributionally robust control design approaches.

### [380] [Defining the Scope of Learning Analytics: An Axiomatic Approach for Analytic Practice and Measurable Learning Phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10081)
*Kensuke Takii,Changhao Liang,Hiroaki Ogata*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces an axiomatic theory for Learning Analytics (LA), providing a formal structure, scope, and limitations, filling a theoretical gap in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the theoretical under-specification of Learning Analytics (LA), ensuring it has a foundational framework for better clarity and scientific rigor in its methodologies.

Method: The authors developed five fundamental axioms derived from psychological theories of learning and LA’s practical needs, leading to a robust theoretical framework and derivation of related theorems.

Result: The axioms clarify LA’s epistemological stance, define structure and practices within LA, and provide insights into challenges like the unobservability of learner states and the irreducibility of temporal order.

Conclusion: The proposed theory establishes LA as a science of state transition systems, offering principles for data analysis and interpretation while avoiding simplistic or erroneous models.

Abstract: Learning Analytics (LA) has rapidly expanded through practical and technological innovation, yet its foundational identity has remained theoretically under-specified. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the first axiomatic theory that formally defines the essential structure, scope, and limitations of LA. Derived from the psychological definition of learning and the methodological requirements of LA, the framework consists of five axioms specifying discrete observation, experience construction, state transition, and inference. From these axioms, we derive a set of theorems and propositions that clarify the epistemological stance of LA, including the inherent unobservability of learner states, the irreducibility of temporal order, constraints on reachable states, and the impossibility of deterministically predicting future learning. We further define LA structure and LA practice as formal objects, demonstrating the sufficiency and necessity of the axioms and showing that diverse LA approaches -- such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and dashboards -- can be uniformly explained within this framework. The theory provides guiding principles for designing analytic methods and interpreting learning data while avoiding naive behaviorism and category errors by establishing an explicit theoretical inference layer between observations and states. This work positions LA as a rigorous science of state transition systems based on observability, establishing the theoretical foundation necessary for the field's maturation as a scholarly discipline.

### [381] [Enhancing Large Language Models for End-to-End Circuit Analysis Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10159)
*Liangliang Chen,Weiyu Sun,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper enhances an AI-based circuit analysis tool (built on Gemini 2.5 Pro) by addressing issues in diagram recognition and reasoning accuracy, boosting performance to a 97.59% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable AI tools in engineering education and problem-solving, as existing LLMs struggle with multimodal tasks like circuit analysis.

Method: The authors identified core weaknesses in Gemini 2.5 Pro (recognition and reasoning errors) and implemented improvements using fine-tuned YOLO for image processing and an ngspice verification loop to refine solutions.

Result: The enhanced system achieved substantial improvement on 83 circuit problems, with a success rate of 97.59%, up from Gemini 2.5 Pro's 79.52%.

Conclusion: This enhanced pipeline demonstrates significant progress in multimodal engineering tasks, aiding both automated educational tools and accurate circuit analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in data-rich domains such as programming, but their reliability in engineering tasks remains limited. Circuit analysis -- requiring multimodal understanding and precise mathematical reasoning -- highlights these challenges. Although Gemini 2.5 Pro improves diagram interpretation and analog-circuit reasoning, it still struggles to consistently produce correct solutions when given both text and circuit diagrams. At the same time, engineering education needs scalable AI tools capable of generating accurate solutions for tasks such as automated homework feedback and question-answering. This paper presents an enhanced, end-to-end circuit problem solver built on Gemini 2.5 Pro. We first benchmark Gemini on a representative set of undergraduate circuit problems and identify two major failure modes: 1) circuit-recognition hallucinations, particularly incorrect source polarity detection, and 2) reasoning-process hallucinations, such as incorrect current directions. To address recognition errors, we integrate a fine-tuned YOLO detector and OpenCV processing to isolate voltage and current sources, enabling Gemini to re-identify source polarities from cropped images with near-perfect accuracy. To reduce reasoning errors, we introduce an ngspice-based verification loop in which Gemini generates a .cir file, ngspice simulates the circuit, and discrepancies trigger iterative regeneration with optional human-in-the-loop review. Across 83 problems, the proposed pipeline achieves a 97.59% success rate (81 correct solutions), substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro's original 79.52% accuracy. This system extends LLM capabilities for multimodal engineering problem-solving and supports the creation of high-quality educational datasets and AI-powered instructional tools.

### [382] [Designing AI-Resilient Assessments Using Interconnected Problems: A Theoretically Grounded and Empirically Validated Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10758)
*Kaihua Ding*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges posed by generative AI in computing education assessments, proposing a framework to design AI-resilient assessments through interconnected and semi-structured problems validated by empirical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of generative AI has created a gap between traditional academic assessments and real-world practices, necessitating a rethinking of evaluation methods to maintain academic integrity.

Method: The paper establishes two theoretical principles for assessment design: interconnected problems for multi-step reasoning and semi-structured problems for reliable competence measurement, supported by data analysis from university courses.

Result: Empirical validation shows interconnected projects are more effective in assessing skills without AI misuse, whereas proctored exams suggest higher AI score inflation and weaker alignment with learning outcomes.

Conclusion: The findings offer a practical framework that fosters integrative thinking, aligns assessments with real-world AI-enhanced workflows, and naturally resists AI misuse, helping maintain academic integrity.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI has undermined traditional modular assessments in computing education, creating a disconnect between academic evaluation and industry practice. This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and multi-year empirical validation.
  We make three contributions. First, we establish two theoretical results: (1) assessments composed of interconnected problems, where outputs feed into subsequent stages, are more AI-resilient than modular assessments because current language models struggle with sustained multi-step reasoning and context; and (2) semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution patterns. These results challenge common policy and institutional guidance that promotes open-ended assessments as the primary safeguard for academic integrity.
  Second, we validate these results using data from four university data science courses (N = 138). While students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, performance drops by roughly 30 percentage points on proctored exams, indicating substantial AI score inflation. Interconnected projects remain strongly correlated with modular assessments, suggesting they measure the same underlying skills while resisting AI misuse. Proctored exams show weaker alignment, implying they may assess test-taking ability rather than intended learning outcomes.
  Third, we translate these findings into a practical assessment design framework. The proposed approach enables educators to create assessments that promote integrative thinking, reflect real-world AI-augmented workflows, and naturally resist trivial delegation to generative AI, thereby helping restore academic integrity.

*Nicholas Clark,Ryan Bai,Tanu Mitra*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Offscript, a tool to audit whether large language models follow user instructions effectively, finding deviations in over 86% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of mechanisms to evaluate if LLMs adhere to user-provided custom instructions effectively for information seeking.

Method: Developing Offscript, an automated auditing system, and applying it to LLM interactions sourced from Reddit to detect instruction-following deviations.

Result: Offscript identified potential instruction-following failures in 86.4% of conversations, with 22.2% confirmed as material violations through human review.

Conclusion: Automated auditing is a viable approach for evaluating LLM compliance with user instructions during information-seeking interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative search systems are increasingly used for information seeking by diverse populations with varying preferences for knowledge sourcing and presentation. While users can customize LLM behavior through custom instructions and behavioral prompts, no mechanism exists to evaluate whether these instructions are being followed effectively. We present Offscript, an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. In a pilot study analyzing custom instructions sourced from Reddit, Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, 22.2% of which were confirmed as material violations through human review. Our findings suggest that automated auditing serves as a viable approach for evaluating compliance to behavioral instructions related to information seeking.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study introduces CompanionCast, a multi-agent conversational AI system designed to simulate social presence in shared viewing experiences, validated through soccer viewing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern media consumption is increasingly solitary, reducing the enjoyment of social presence while watching content together.

Method: The CompanionCast framework utilizes multiple role-specialized AI agents, multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, spatial audio, and an LLM-as-a-Judge module to refine conversations based on relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, and personality consistency.

Result: Pilot study results in sports viewing (soccer) suggest that multi-agent interaction enhances perceived social presence compared to solo viewing.

Conclusion: CompanionCast offers a generalizable AI framework that improves social presence in co-viewing scenarios, with potential applications in diverse domains like entertainment, education, and collaboration.

Abstract: Social presence is central to the enjoyment of watching content together, yet modern media consumption is increasingly solitary. We investigate whether multi-agent conversational AI systems can recreate the dynamics of shared viewing experiences across diverse content types. We present CompanionCast, a general framework for orchestrating multiple role-specialized AI agents that respond to video content using multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. Distinctly, CompanionCast integrates an LLM-as-a-Judge module that iteratively scores and refines conversations across five dimensions (relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, personality consistency). We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. We discuss challenges and future directions for applying this approach to diverse viewing contexts including entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InFerActive, an interactive system to improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of human evaluation of large language models through adaptive visualization of expansive output trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current human evaluation process of LLM outputs is inefficient and challenging to scale due to the need to review numerous individual responses. Additionally, conventional methods are not equipped to handle the large, complex tree structures generated by modern language models.

Method: The paper presents InFerActive, which uses probability-based filtering and visualization techniques to enable efficient, interactive exploration of LLM outputs while bridging the gap between token representation and human readability.

Result: The system was validated through technical evaluation and a user study (N=12), showing significant improvements in efficiency and enabling deeper analysis of model behavior.

Conclusion: InFerActive enhances human evaluation workflows for LLMs and has the potential to transform how these models are assessed by addressing scalability issues and improving comprehensiveness.

Abstract: Human evaluation remains the gold standard for evaluating outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection. However, conventional tree visualization cannot scale to the exponentially large trees generated by modern sampling methods of LLMs. To address this problem, we present InFerActive, an interactive inference system for scalable human evaluation. InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior. We further conduct expert case studies that demonstrate InFerActive's practical applicability and potential for transforming LLM evaluation workflows.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid AI approach (PMB-NN) integrating neural networks and physiological modeling for interpretable blood pressure estimation, achieving competitive accuracy and enhanced physiological plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and accurate methods for continuous blood pressure and hemodynamic parameter monitoring using wearable devices.

Method: The study developed a hybrid AI model, PMB-NN, combining a 2-element Windkessel physiological model with neural networks. PPG-derived features and demographic data were used for subject-specific training and validation against DL models and the standalone physiological model.

Result: PMB-NN achieved a systolic BP MAE of 7.2 mmHg, comparable to DL models, and a diastolic BP MAE of 3.9 mmHg, slightly worse than DL. It exhibited better physiological plausibility and identified R and C parameters with accuracy akin to the standalone model.

Conclusion: PMB-NN strikes a balance between physiological interpretability and predictive accuracy, offering a promising framework for daily hemodynamic monitoring compared to purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and hemodynamic parameters such as peripheral resistance (R) and arterial compliance (C) are critical for early vascular dysfunction detection. While photoplethysmography (PPG) wearables has gained popularity, existing data-driven methods for BP estimation lack interpretability. We advanced our previously proposed physiology-centered hybrid AI method-Physiological Model-Based Neural Network (PMB-NN)-in blood pressure estimation, that unifies deep learning with a 2-element Windkessel based model parameterized by R and C acting as physics constraints. The PMB-NN model was trained in a subject-specific manner using PPG-derived timing features, while demographic information was used to infer an intermediate variable: cardiac output. We validated the model on 10 healthy adults performing static and cycling activities across two days for model's day-to-day robustness, benchmarked against deep learning (DL) models (FCNN, CNN-LSTM, Transformer) and standalone Windkessel based physiological model (PM). Validation was conducted on three perspectives: accuracy, interpretability and plausibility. PMB-NN achieved systolic BP accuracy (MAE: 7.2 mmHg) comparable to DL benchmarks, diastolic performance (MAE: 3.9 mmHg) lower than DL models. However, PMB-NN exhibited higher physiological plausibility than both DL baselines and PM, suggesting that the hybrid architecture unifies and enhances the respective merits of physiological principles and data-driven techniques. Beyond BP, PMB-NN identified R (ME: 0.15 mmHg$\cdot$s/ml) and C (ME: -0.35 ml/mmHg) during training with accuracy similar to PM, demonstrating that the embedded physiological constraints confer interpretability to the hybrid AI framework. These results position PMB-NN as a balanced, physiologically grounded alternative to purely data-driven approaches for daily hemodynamic monitoring.

*Stella C. Dong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-CMASP, a model for reinsurance decision-making that incorporates multi-agent simulation with normative constraints to address challenges of distributed information and regulatory demands, improving coordination and behavior stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinsurance decision-making involves complex dynamics like distributed information, observability, and regulatory requirements, which deterministic automation cannot handle effectively.

Method: The authors propose R-CMASP, extending stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by introducing simulator-driven dynamics, role-specialized agents, and a normative feasibility layer for compliance with rules.

Result: Experiments with LLM-based agents show superior coordination, coherence, and adherence to norms compared to traditional methods, with benefits such as reduced pricing variance and better capital efficiency.

Conclusion: Simulator-driven, norm-governed multi-agent systems are ideal for regulated decision environments like reinsurance, as they improve stability and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using geometric machine learning to find Hermitian Yang-Mills solutions on vector bundles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective computation of the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations in complex scenarios, including heterotic string compactifications.

Method: An alternating optimization algorithm based on geometric machine learning, applicable broadly with minimal assumptions on the vector bundle.

Result: Successfully computed Hermitian Yang-Mills solutions and Yukawa couplings in heterotic compactifications with non-Abelian gauge bundles.

Conclusion: The method proves to be a versatile and generalizable approach for solving the equations and computing relevant physical couplings.

Abstract: We compute solutions to the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations on holomorphic vector bundles $V$ via an alternating optimisation procedure founded on geometric machine learning. The proposed method is fully general with respect to the rank and structure group of $V$, requiring only the ability to enumerate a basis of global sections for a given bundle. This enables us to compute the physically normalised Yukawa couplings in a broad class of heterotic string compactifications. Using this method, we carry out this computation in full for a heterotic compactification incorporating a gauge bundle with non-Abelian structure group.

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning approach using graph and moment neural networks trained on semi-analytic galaxy catalogs to predict matter density parameters ($Ω_{\rm m}$) with ~10% precision, generalizing well across different simulation models and physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce a robust machine learning model for cosmological parameter inference leveraging semi-analytic galaxy models, which are more efficient than computationally expensive full hydrodynamical simulations.

Method: The study trains a graph neural network coupled with a moment neural network on galaxy 3D positions and radial velocities, using small volumetric segments from L-Galaxies catalogs, to infer matter density parameters.

Result: The model achieved 10% precision in estimating $Ω_{\rm m}$ and exhibited strong generalizability across different semi-analytic and hydrodynamical simulation models, proving robust against varying physical and cosmological parameters.

Conclusion: Semi-analytic models enable extracting physical relationships in galaxy phase-space that are independent of specific simulation physics, underscoring their utility in creating realistic galaxy catalogs for cosmological analysis.

Abstract: Semi-analytic models are a widely used approach to simulate galaxy properties within a cosmological framework, relying on simplified yet physically motivated prescriptions. They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.

Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are widely used to model stochastic dynamics in chemical kinetics, systems biology and epidemiology. Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schlögl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices. The present approach thus enables efficient modeling of chemical reaction networks in general.

Motivation: To enhance the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of UAVs by addressing limitations in traditional wind estimation methods.

Method: A disturbance observer (DOB) estimates aerodynamic forces, and a thin-plate spline (TPS) model maps these to wind vectors. Aerodynamic sensitivity is further improved through a wind barrel on the UAV.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy in wind estimation across various scenarios, outperforming existing baselines regarding RMSE values for speed and direction estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed onboard system delivers real-time, high-accuracy wind estimation suitable for agile flight and resource-constrained UAVs.

Abstract: Accurate real-time wind vector estimation is essential for enhancing the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the method provides vertical wind estimates -- unavailable in baselines -- with RMSEs below \SI{0.17}{m/s} even during fast indoor translations.
