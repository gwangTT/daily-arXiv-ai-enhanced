This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of\ndifferential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using\ndata from different structures, categories, and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with differential privacy to improve respiratory disease diagnosis under limited labeled data and privacy constraints.", "motivation": "To address the challenges of limited high-quality labeled medical datasets for respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained settings, and to ensure patient privacy in decentralized data environments.", "method": "The paper introduces a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm to reduce overfitting due to limited data, employs differential privacy noise to safeguard against gradient leakage, and uses a weighted average algorithm for aggregating diagnostic models in a federated setting.", "result": "The proposed framework demonstrates strong performance in diagnosing respiratory diseases across diverse data structures and distributions, all while maintaining privacy through differential privacy mechanisms.", "conclusion": "The study successfully combines federated learning, few-shot learning, and privacy preservation, presenting an effective and privacy-conscious approach to respiratory disease diagnosis."}}

However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly\nsensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs\nthat collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,\ncommunication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated\nTwin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT\nsynchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is\nGeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from\nvehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through\nMeta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local\nentities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures\nscalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our\nsystem is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that\nrenders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently\noutperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric\nerror and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically\nreducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,\ncontext-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs.
