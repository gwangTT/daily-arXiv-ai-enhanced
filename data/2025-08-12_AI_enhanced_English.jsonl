In this\npaper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from\ntraining data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more\ntamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable\ndata filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for\nminimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple\n6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial\nresistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M\ntokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training\nbaselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to\nunrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized\ndangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when\nit is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a\nneed for a defense-in-depth approach.

As a result, using different\ndata sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to\nheterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield\nunsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a\ncriterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the\nopen-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate\nelements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination.

To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT).

Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity.

The VGGSounder dataset is\ncommonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification.\nHowever, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSounder, including\nincomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities.\nThese lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively\nre-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically\ndesigned to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features\ndetailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific\nperformance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance\ndegradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion\nmetric.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper critiques the limitations of the VGGSounder dataset in audio-visual model evaluation and introduces an improved version with better annotations and performance metrics.", "motivation": "To address the deficiencies in the VGGSounder dataset, which include incomplete labels, overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities, thus ensuring a more reliable evaluation of audio-visual foundation models.", "method": "The authors comprehensively re-annotated the VGGSound dataset to create a multi-label test set with detailed modality-specific annotations.
