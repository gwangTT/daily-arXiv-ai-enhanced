Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space.

(2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

The submission\n  includes 10 pages and 6 figures", "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,\nincluding safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased\nmaintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our\nknowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety\nchallenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a hybrid control framework combining Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) to safely mitigate structural vibrations without needing explicit system models.", "motivation": "Model-based vibration control strategies like LQR require accurate and tedious system modeling, while model-free RL methods eliminate this need but pose risks during their random exploratory training phase.", "method": "A hybrid framework where an LQR controller, derived from a randomly selected and inaccurate model, safely guides the training of a model-free RL controller on physical systems.", "result": "The proposed hybrid control strategy addresses the training safety challenges of RL in vibration control and minimizes structural harm during the training phase.", "conclusion": "This approach ensures vibration mitigation without relying on precise system models, offering a verified solution to RL's safety challenges during training and advancing vibration control innovation."}}

To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers.

Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query.

Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box\noptimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a\ntheoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model\nso as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced\nexploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto\nchoice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla\nBO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping\nwith high-dimensional counterparts with {\\it irregular} variables (e.g.,\ncategorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates\nhave been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the\nLLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input\nvariables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we\nleverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters\ntogether with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational\nBayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only\ncomputationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits\nrecursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well\nas other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has\nbeen devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model\nweight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed\n(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the\nreal-world molecular optimization tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a Bayesian optimization framework using large language models (LLM) as surrogates to address high-dimensional black-box optimization problems, implementing adaptive approaches for improved efficiency.", "motivation": "High-dimensional black-box optimization challenges pose difficulties, especially with irregular variable types.

We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance\nNetwork (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and\nreliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human\nannotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image\nintuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,\nmaking the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to\nalign its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry\ndiagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and\nmedical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological\nimages.
