Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation\nerrors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing\nresources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we\npropose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).\nSince allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content\naccuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this\nsensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource\ntradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all\nusers with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC).

In this paper, we propose a motion-based\ntemporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric\nmulti-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets.\nOur method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event\ncameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from\nconventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method\nefficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are\nderived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration\npipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset\nand rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and\nrotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a\ncontinuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both\npublicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed\nmethod achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while\nexhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting\nits precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our\nimplementation will be made open-source.

As with any critical\nsafety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service\ndisruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary\ninterruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work\nrelies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.\nThis not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,\nbut it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and\noperational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance\nrecords, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source\nissues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern\nof PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM\nmovement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only\none input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to\nclassify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving\n>99.99\\% precision, <0.01\\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our\nmethodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on\nseveral electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench\nenvironments.

Recent\nadvancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing\nrecommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in\noptimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive\ngeneration mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential\ndependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable\nfor generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single\nrequest session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a\nframework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance\ngenerative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework\nreformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,\nwhere each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,\nand then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative\ntask in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline\nintegrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial\nincremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and\nemphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our\nextensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale\nindustrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend.

In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the\ngeneralization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it\nhelps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and\nrobustness to new, diverse data inputs.

Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability\nof IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent\nchallenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation)\nand also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of\nfoundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware\nreasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference.\nThe complete list of this survey is available at\nhttps://github.com/rh20624/Awesome-IMU-Sensing, which will be updated\ncontinuously.", "AI": {"tldr": "This survey reviews 229 papers and 25 datasets on IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), focusing on methods to improve generalization affected by domain shifts.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address poor generalization in HAR systems, which limits their application in real-world settings.", "method": "The paper categorizes approaches into model-centric methods (pre-training, end-to-end, LLM-based) and data-centric techniques (multi-modal learning, data augmentation).", "result": "The survey highlights the current progress in IMU-based HAR methodologies and datasets, illustrating their broad applicability.", "conclusion": "Future directions include better handling of data scarcity, efficient systems, and the integration of advanced modeling techniques like foundation and large language models."}}
