### [1] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a quantum-inspired algorithm using Matrix Product States and Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods to solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems, achieving efficient and reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an effective and scalable algorithm for solving QUBO problems, which are widely applicable in optimization tasks, and emulate quantum methods for addressing practical computation limitations.

Method: The proposed algorithm uses Matrix Product States to represent spin configurations compactly, a discrete driving schedule for moving states toward the ground state, driver Hamiltonians for spin flips, and applies the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method iteratively.

Result: The algorithm reliably identifies global minima for diverse QUBO instances, solving Sudoku puzzles and MaxCut problems with significant complexity (up to 251 nodes and 3,265 edges).

Conclusion: The quantum-inspired algorithm demonstrates scalability, reliability, and adaptability, making it suitable for large-scale optimization problems relevant to industry.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [2] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a framework to assess reasoning reliability in AI models used for energy analysis by evaluating five key submetrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no standardized framework to ensure AI systems reason correctly in energy sector applications, despite their growing use.

Method: The researchers created the ARB framework with five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency. AI models were tested under identical conditions on open techno-economic datasets.

Result: Among the tested models, GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved the highest reasoning reliability, while Llama 3 70B performed below professional thresholds. Results were statistically validated.

Conclusion: The ARB provides the first quantitative methodology for evaluating reasoning reliability in AI systems, promoting trustworthy applications in energy system analysis.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

### [3] [Branch-and-Browse: Efficient and Controllable Web Exploration with Tree-Structured Reasoning and Action Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19838)
*Shiqi He,Yue Cui,Xinyu Ma,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Branch-and-Browse,' a framework for autonomous web agents leveraging large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning depth, efficiency, and execution for goal-oriented tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing LLM-powered web agent methods, which struggle with multi-step reasoning, effective backtracking, and computational efficiency.

Method: The Branch-and-Browse framework employs structured reasoning with tree-based exploration, background reasoning for state replay, and page action memory to efficiently manage explored actions within and across sessions.

Result: The framework achieves a 35.8% task success rate and reduces execution time by up to 40.4% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the WebArena benchmark.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse enhances the capability of autonomous web agents by providing a reliable and efficient solution for goal-oriented tasks in open web environments.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

### [4] [DAG-Math: Graph-Guided Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19842)
*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper assesses the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a new evaluation framework using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to analyze their reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to determine whether LLMs' success in solving mathematical problems stems from genuine reasoning, rote memorization, or rule-based processes, and to provide metrics beyond traditional accuracy measures.

Method: The authors propose a rule-based stochastic process over DAGs, introduce the 'logical closeness' metric, and create a benchmark (DAG-MATH CoT format) to guide LLM reasoning and evaluate its fidelity under their framework.

Result: The analysis reveals statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among different LLM families, even when their final-answer accuracy (PASS@k) is similar. This highlights the gaps between the correctness of the final answer and adherence to rule-consistent reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework bridges free-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and formal proof systems, enabling a deeper understanding of LLM reasoning and delivering actionable insights for evaluating their reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

### [5] [Surfer 2: The Next Generation of Cross-Platform Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19949)
*Mathieu Andreux,Märt Bakler,Yanael Barbier,Hamza Ben Chekroun,Emilien Biré,Antoine Bonnet,Riaz Bordie,Nathan Bout,Matthias Brunel,Aleix Cambray,Pierre-Louis Cedoz,Antoine Chassang,Gautier Cloix,Ethan Connelly,Alexandra Constantinou,Ramzi De Coster,Hubert de la Jonquiere,Aurélien Delfosse,Maxime Delpit,Alexis Deprez,Augustin Derupti,Mathieu Diaz,Shannon D'Souza,Julie Dujardin,Abai Edmund,Michael Eickenberg,Armand Fatalot,Wissem Felissi,Isaac Herring,Xavier Koegler,Erwan Le Jumeau de Kergaradec,Aurélien Lac,Maxime Langevin,Corentin Lauverjat,Antonio Loison,Avshalom Manevich,Axel Moyal,Axel Nguyen Kerbel,Marinela Parovic,Julien Revelle,Guillaume Richard,Mats Richter,Ronan Riochet,María Santos,Romain Savidan,Laurent Sifre,Maxime Theillard,Marc Thibault,Ivan Valentini,Tony Wu,Laura Yie,Kai Yuan,Jevgenij Zubovskij*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Surfer 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in web, desktop, and mobile environments using visual observations, exceeding human performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems lack generalizability across different platforms due to reliance on environment-specific interfaces.

Method: Surfer 2 uses a unified architecture with hierarchical context management, decoupled planning/execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery.

Result: Surfer 2 achieves high accuracy scores across multiple environments, surpassing prior systems and human performance in benchmarks without task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of orchestrated foundational models for general-purpose computer control via visual interaction, paving the way for advancements in vision language models.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

### [6] [RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954)
*Joseph Meyer,Divyansha Lachi,Reza Mohammadi,Roshan Reddy Upendra,Eva L. Dyer,Mark Li,Tom Palczewski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE is a general-purpose, schema-agnostic feature encoder for heterogeneous temporal graphs, achieving high performance and scalability in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle with scalability and parameter sharing because they require schema-specific feature encoders for different node types and features, limiting their efficiency and generalizability.

Method: RELATE introduces shared modality-specific encoders for different types of attributes and uses a Perceiver-style cross-attention module to create fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representations. It is compatible as a plug-and-play component with general-purpose GNNs.

Result: In evaluations on the RelBench benchmark using ReLGNN and HGT models, RELATE performed within 3% of schema-specific models while significantly reducing parameter requirements by up to 5x.

Conclusion: RELATE supports varying schemas, facilitates multi-dataset pretraining, and represents a step towards foundational models for relational graph data.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [7] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI is making insurance fraud easier and more scalable, especially through fake crash photos and identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and counter the impact of generative AI on insurance fraud, which causes billions of dollars in losses yearly.

Method: Introduction of UVeye layered solution aimed at detecting, mitigating, and deterring AI-enabled vehicle fraud.

Result: Identifies significant challenges in combating AI-enabled fraud and introduces a novel approach through the UVeye system.

Conclusion: Generative AI poses an evolving threat to insurance fraud, requiring innovative detection and prevention solutions like UVeye.

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

### [8] [AI-Driven Personalized Learning: Predicting Academic Per-formance Through Leadership Personality Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19964)
*Nitsa J Herzog,Rejwan Bin Sulaiman,David J Herzog,Rose Fong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates using AI and machine learning to predict academic success through leadership personality traits and modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to assess the potential of AI technologies for personalized learning by exploring how leadership personality traits can predict academic success.

Method: Data was collected from 129 environmental engineering master's students who underwent five personality tests. Exploratory data and correlation analysis were performed, and seven machine learning algorithms (e.g., RF, SVM, KNN) were used to build models for academic success prediction.

Result: The RF classifier achieved the highest accuracy (87.50% with 17 personality traits and leadership marks; 85.71% without the leadership mark).

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for identifying students' strengths and weaknesses early in their education, aiding the use of targeted personalized learning approaches.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

### [9] [LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075)
*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals a method to embed hidden messages within coherent texts using Large Language Models (LLMs), raising concerns about trust, intent, and AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to demonstrate how LLMs can decouple text from authorial intent and explore its impact on trust in communication and AI safety.

Method: A simple and efficient protocol is introduced to encode and decode concealed messages using LLMs, tested on an 8-billion-parameter model, achieving high-quality results locally.

Result: Texts hidden within other texts are successfully encoded/decoded using LLMs. The protocol is shown to work quickly and efficiently on a standard laptop.

Conclusion: This capability of LLMs to conceal messages poses challenges for trust, comprehension of authorial intent, and AI safety, highlighting a need for deeper investigation into these implications.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

### [10] [AI PB: A Grounded Generative Agent for Personalized Investment Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20099)
*Daewoo Park,Suho Park,Inseok Hong,Hanwool Lee,Junkyu Park,Sangjun Lee,Jeongman An,Hyunbin Loh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AI PB, a proactive generative agent for retail finance that offers tailored investment insights using a hybrid system of orchestrated AI tools and strict compliance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance traditional chatbot systems by developing a generative AI capable of providing proactive, compliant, and personalized investment insights in retail finance.

Method: The system combines a deterministic orchestration layer for routing, a hybrid retrieval pipeline with OpenSearch and domain-specific embeddings, and a multi-stage recommendation mechanism integrating rules, behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits.

Result: AI PB operates successfully on-premises under Korean financial regulations, utilizing extensive computing resources. It demonstrates grounded, safe, and trustworthy AI insights through quantitative metrics and human quality assurance.

Conclusion: AI PB showcases the effectiveness of layered safety and explicit routing mechanisms in delivering reliable generative AI capabilities for high-stakes sectors like finance.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

### [11] [Human-Centered LLM-Agent System for Detecting Anomalous Digital Asset Transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20102)
*Gyuyeon Na,Minjung Park,Hyeonjeong Cha,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCLA, a human-centered anomaly detection system for digital asset transactions, enhancing explainability and enabling interaction with non-expert users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency and trust in financial forensics by facilitating human involvement and interpretability in anomaly detection.

Method: HCLA combines roles of parsing, detection, and explanation into a conversational, human-in-the-loop workflow, using XGBoost for detection and a web-based interface for user interaction.

Result: The proposed system achieves strong accuracy on a Bitcoin mixing dataset and adds interpretability and interactive capabilities to anomaly detection.

Conclusion: HCLA enhances financial forensics by enabling non-experts to interact, understand, and refine anomaly detection processes, thereby increasing trust and transparency.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [12] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the overenthusiasm about AI's role in legal practice, proposing a new paradigm to address its risks and limitations, particularly around accuracy and ethical duties, and presents the verification-value paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the assumptions around the benefits of AI in legal practice, emphasizing the potential ethical and practical challenges posed by inaccuracies and lack of transparency in AI outputs.

Method: The paper introduces the verification-value paradox, and analyzes cases where lawyers were reprimanded for AI-related inaccuracies, proposing a model to examine AI use in legal practice.

Result: Findings reveal that while AI can enhance efficiency, its use demands extensive manual verification to uphold legal duties, resulting in negligible net advantages for lawyers.

Conclusion: AI use in legal practice must prioritize truth and civic responsibility, suggesting significant revisions in professional practice and legal education.

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

### [13] [TRUST: A Decentralized Framework for Auditing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20188)
*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRUST, a decentralized framework for auditing reasoning traces in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure faithfulness, harmlessness, and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for auditing LLMs are centralized, opaque, and inefficient, posing risks such as biases, difficulty scaling, lack of public trust, and threats to proprietary information.

Method: The TRUST framework integrates a consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, hierarchical DAG decomposition for trace auditing, a blockchain ledger for accountability, and privacy-preserving segmentation to overcome auditing limitations.

Result: Experiments with various LLMs across reasoning tasks demonstrate TRUST’s effectiveness in detecting flaws and robustness against adversarial auditors.

Conclusion: TRUST represents a pioneering approach to decentralized AI auditing, addressing key challenges to ensure safe and transparent deployment of LLMs in critical domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public

### [14] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper hypothesizes a transition phase in developing AGI where language models consolidate their identity, resisting external steering. It explores its implications on performance, capabilities, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the progression of language models towards AGI, particularly focusing on the behavioral and identity consolidation phases, which impacts reliability and safety.

Method: Formalization of identity consolidation in learning dynamics, proposing and experimenting with operational metrics to detect this transition.

Result: The study finds that consolidation impacts general capabilities differently, with performance trade-offs and instabilities varying across model scales.

Conclusion: Identity consolidation is essential for AGI reliability and is a crucial point for safety, as it can be engineered for predictable behavior or emerge spontaneously with scaling, raising concerns about hardened goals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

### [15] [Merge and Conquer: Evolutionarily Optimizing AI for 2048](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20205)
*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores evolutionary training methods for AI systems solving 2048, demonstrating success in single-agent systems but limitations in two-agent metaprompting approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to optimize AI for dynamic and non-deterministic environments, using the game 2048 as a testbed due to its strategic and stochastic challenges.

Method: The researchers implemented two AI systems: a two-agent LLM-based metaprompting mechanism and a single-agent system employing a refined value function for Monte Carlo Tree Search, including rollback features.

Result: The single-agent system showed significant performance improvement (473.2 points per cycle), with a positive correlation across training cycles. Two-agent metaprompting was less successful, revealing limitations in such approaches.

Conclusion: Evolutionary refinement methods proved effective for improving AI in dynamic environments, with single-agent strategies showing clear benefits. Meta-prompting systems require further exploration to overcome their current limitations.

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to simulate individualized cognitive processes through authorial style emulation and introduces a dataset and evaluation framework to assess this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore LLMs' capability to go beyond surface-level behavior (such as role-play) by examining their ability to replicate deeper, individualized cognitive processes like storytelling and authorial style.

Method: The authors introduce an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework and construct a novel dataset from recently published novels. They benchmark seven LLMs using multiple cognitive representation methods, such as linguistic features, concept mappings, and profile-based information.

Result: The study found that combining conceptual and linguistic features enhances LLM performance in cognitive simulation, especially for emulating linguistic style, though LLMs are less successful in replicating narrative structures.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit potential in simulating cognitive processes for personalized, creative AI applications, but their limitations in deeper cognitive simulation remain challenges for future research.

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

### [17] [Using Large Language Models for Abstraction of Planning Domains - Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20258)
*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for generating abstract PDDL domains and problem instances aligned with specific goals, focusing on creating abstractions for planning and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of creating meaningful abstractions for dynamic domains, as these abstractions play a key role in an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide explanations.

Method: The authors model concrete behaviors in PDDL and utilize in-context learning with LLMs to generate abstract PDDL domains based on natural language abstraction objectives. The abstractions are validated using symbolic tools and human experts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GPT-4 effectively synthesizes useful domain abstractions, especially in simple contexts, and excels at abstracting actions over fluents.

Conclusion: While effective in certain domains, GPT-4 shows limitations in abstracting action fluents, highlighting the need for further refinement in using LLMs for dynamic domain abstraction.

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

*Yunzhi Liu,Haokai Tan,Rushi Kanjaria,Lihuan Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaBERT introduces an advanced BERT-based model for predicting human mobility by integrating temporal descriptors and points of interest (POI) embeddings, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance human mobility forecasting for applications such as disaster relief and city planning by overcoming limitations of existing models, which lack rich semantic understanding from temporal and POI data.

Method: The authors developed STaBERT by incorporating temporal descriptors and POI embeddings into a BERT-based architecture, enabling a unified and semantically rich representation of movement.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that STaBERT improves prediction accuracy with GEO-BLEU scores increasing from 0.34 to 0.75 for single-city predictions and from 0.34 to 0.56 for multi-city predictions.

Conclusion: STaBERT effectively captures semantic and temporal aspects of human mobility patterns, making it useful for practical applications and advancing mobility forecasting research.

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

*Mingliang Zhai,Hansheng Liang,Xiaomeng Fan,Zhi Gao,Chuanhao Li,Che Sun,Xu Bin,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolEQA improves Embodied Question Answering (EQA) by integrating external tools and multi-step reasoning for more accurate answers and efficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EQA methods lack explicit reasoning and planning, leading to inefficient exploration and inadequate responses.

Method: ToolEQA incorporates external tools and multi-step reasoning, alongside a novel EQA data pipeline creating the large-scale EQA-RT dataset.

Result: ToolEQA outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 9.2~20.2% on success rate and achieved top performance across several EQA datasets.

Conclusion: ToolEQA demonstrates effective tool usage and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhancing EQA task success and general applicability.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

TL;DR: This paper identifies biases in clinical data collection for AI healthcare solutions and offers recommendations for fairer AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in integrating AI into real-world clinical practice due to biases in training data.

Method: Insights were drawn from the AI4HealthyAging project to analyze and detect types of bias in clinical data collection.

Result: Several types of biases (e.g., historical, representation, measurement) were found across diverse variables including sex, age, and socioeconomic status.

Conclusion: The study provides practical recommendations to enhance fairness and robustness in clinical data collection and aims to contribute to fairer AI systems in healthcare.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collateral damage assessment model for military AI systems, focusing on targeting with minimized risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing usage of AI systems in military operations makes assessing potential collateral effects critical.

Method: The proposed model uses a layered Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture that integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions.

Result: The model effectively evaluates collateral damage, incorporating severity, spreading, likelihood, and metrics as demonstrated through instantiation.

Conclusion: This research establishes a foundational framework for building responsible and trustworthy AI systems in military targeting.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Knowledge Graph (KG) construction from traditional methods to generative, language-driven frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the shift in KG construction, driven by LLMs, and to explore their impact on traditional KG methodologies.

Method: The authors systematically review and compare traditional and LLM-driven KG construction methods, organizing their findings from schema-based and schema-free paradigms, while identifying limitations.

Result: The paper synthesizes current approaches, highlights key frameworks and their mechanisms, and identifies the shortcomings of LLM-driven methods.

Conclusion: The paper outlines emerging trends and future research directions, aiming to bridge symbolic knowledge engineering with neural semantic understanding for more adaptive and intelligent systems.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IKnow, a novel framework for adapting large language models to new domains without degrading their capabilities or relying on external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of domain adaptation in LLMs where standard self-supervised objectives degrade performance and external resources may not be accessible.

Method: IKnow formulates self-supervised objectives using instruction-response dialogue formats, leveraging domain knowledge within the text itself to improve semantic encoding.

Result: IKnow effectively adapts LLMs to new domains while maintaining their instruction-following capabilities, without requiring base model access or external databases.

Conclusion: IKnow offers a practical and efficient solution for continual pretraining of LLMs under constrained and resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the novelty and usefulness of generated innovation opportunities using computational approaches informed by creativity theories.

Method: The study designed and implemented a computational model with five functions aimed at generating innovative outcomes, evaluated in the context of the hospitality sector against existing models.

Result: The new computational model produced results that surpassed those of Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o in novelty and usefulness, though some functions were less effective.

Conclusion: While the model shows promise in generating novel and useful outputs, certain functions need improvement to fully achieve desired results.

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EBR, a neural reasoner using embeddings, addressing shortcomings of DL reasoners in concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current description logic (DL) reasoners struggle with inconsistencies and incorrect data, limiting their applicability in real-world knowledge bases.

Method: EBR uses neural embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoning, focusing on retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions.

Result: Experiments show that EBR outperforms state-of-the-art reasoners in robustness against missing and erroneous data.

Conclusion: EBR demonstrates significant potential as a robust neural reasoner for concept learning in complex knowledge bases.

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

TL;DR: FLORA is an unsupervised fuzzy logic-based method for holistic knowledge graph alignment that handles entities, relations, and dangling entities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge graph alignment methods usually focus purely on entity-level alignment, lack interpretability in reasoning, and rely on training data, limiting their effectiveness and usability.

Method: FLORA uses fuzzy logic to iteratively align entities and relations across two knowledge graphs without requiring training data, while being interpretable and allowing dangling entities.

Result: FLORA demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks and offers provable convergence during the alignment process.

Conclusion: The proposed approach, FLORA, addresses limitations in existing methods by providing an unsupervised, interpretable, and innovative solution for knowledge graph alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Policymakers struggle to incorporate public input on AI governance effectively. Current methods fail to attract diverse participation and respond meaningfully to feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights a critical gap between public opinion and policymaker actions in the realm of AI governance, aiming to address the lack of public trust and legitimacy in AI policies.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative landscape analysis of public consultation processes in AI governance in Australia, Colombia, and the United States, examining methods of soliciting public input and their impact on policy formation.

Result: Across three countries, less than one percent of citizens participated in consultations, illustrating limited outreach and engagement. Governments showed minimal responsiveness to the input received, resulting in ineffective feedback loops and a lack of trust in AI governance.

Conclusion: Current participatory methods in AI governance are insufficient to build trust and legitimacy. Policymakers must implement recommended actions, such as promoting AI literacy, inclusive outreach, and innovative engagement, to address the persistent gap.

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks to optimize network topology for congestion management in power grids, achieving significant speed-ups and improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers for network topology optimization (NTO) problems face scalability challenges and machine learning methods struggle with generalization across unseen conditions and systems.

Method: The authors developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework using a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing neural network to identify effective busbar splitting actions as solutions for NTO problems.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, achieving near-real-time solutions with an optimality gap of 2.3% on large-scale systems.

Conclusion: The GNN-based approach improves the practicality of large-scale NTO by addressing generalization issues and enabling faster, feasible solutions for congestion management.

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

### [29] [What Defines Good Reasoning in LLMs? Dissecting Reasoning Steps with Multi-Aspect Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20603)
*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a granular evaluation of reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by assessing relevance and coherence, introducing a method called causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current evaluation of LLMs focuses on final-answer correctness, providing limited insights into the quality of their reasoning processes. There is a need to develop robust models by improving evaluation methods.

Method: The authors introduce CaSE (causal stepwise evaluation), a method to evaluate reasoning step quality based on relevance and coherence while avoiding hindsight bias. This is validated using annotated benchmarks (MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH).

Result: CaSE effectively aligns with human judgments and helps improve training data through a focus on reasoning quality, which directly enhances task performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of granular reasoning evaluation, presenting CaSE as a scalable and effective tool to analyze, debug, and improve LLM reasoning, beyond standard validity checks.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

### [30] [Efficient Algorithms for Computing Random Walk Centrality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20604)
*Changan Liu,Zixuan Xie,Ahad N. Zehmakan,Zhongzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces two scalable algorithms for efficient computation of random walk centrality in large networks, achieving near-linear time complexity with strong approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing random walk centrality is computationally expensive for large networks, limiting its practicality despite its usefulness in quantifying node importance and influence.

Method: Two scalable algorithms are proposed: one using approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, and another based on sampling rooted spanning trees, to compute random walk centrality efficiently.

Result: The proposed algorithms show strong approximation performance and are highly efficient in experiments on large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes.

Conclusion: The novel algorithms effectively compute random walk centrality with considerable scalability, enabling applications in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

*Riccardo Guidotti,Martina Cinquini,Marta Marchiori Manerba,Mattia Setzu,Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MIMOSA framework, a methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability, performance, and ethical properties, while embedding considerations such as causality, fairness, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trust, accountability, and safety in automated decision-making, models must be both interpretable and ethically sound.

Method: The authors define interpretability-focused models across diverse data types and tasks, categorize these models into three families (feature importance, rule-based, instance-based), and describe how to embed ethical properties (causality, fairness, privacy) into these systems.

Result: The paper lays out the formal foundation for integrating interpretability and ethical considerations into predictive modeling, providing evaluation metrics and verification procedures.

Conclusion: By emphasizing trustworthiness through interpretability and ethical properties, the MIMOSA framework offers a theoretical roadmap for developing advanced, transparent, and responsible AI systems.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

*Shuyi Xie,Ziqin Liew,Hailing Zhang,Haibo Zhang,Ling Hu,Zhiqiang Zhou,Shuman Liu,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcomEval benchmarks LLMs in e-commerce with multilingual and multimodal tasks addressing real shopping scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations in e-commerce lack diversity in tasks, modalities, and multilingual perspectives, creating a need for a comprehensive tool for assessing performance in real-world shopping applications.

Method: EcomEval includes 37 tasks across 6 categories, using authentic customer queries and transaction logs in seven languages. Candidate answers from large models are reviewed by expert annotators to ensure quality and scalability.

Result: EcomEval provides a fine-grained, challenge-oriented benchmark that evaluates LLMs across multiple dimensions including task difficulty and multilingual capabilities.

Conclusion: EcomEval fills gaps in e-commerce benchmarking by delivering a robust tool for assessing LLMs in complex, real-world, multilingual shopping contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Fluidity Index (FI) to measure model adaptability in dynamic and scaling environments, focusing on response accuracy and context-switching abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance the adaptability of models in dynamic, scaling environments for improved real-world application and interaction.

Method: The study introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) as a benchmark tool, evaluating model adaptability through state deviations and prioritizing real-world closed-loop open-ended benchmarks.

Result: The Fluidity Index reveals how well models understand, predict, and adjust to environmental state changes, emphasizing the need for second-order adaptability.

Conclusion: Achieving second-order adaptability is crucial for super-intelligent models, enabling self-sustained computation and optimal fluidity in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of machine learning (ML) with Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) rational agent architectures, presenting a systematisation of approaches and identifying key research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented and incoherent development landscape of rational agent frameworks where ML is integrated, emphasizing the expressive potential of BDI architectures.

Method: The paper systematises existing approaches related to ML integration with BDI agents, analyzing the literature and using the BDI paradigm as a framework for the study.

Result: The analysis evidences a fast-developing body of research around ML-enhanced rational agents and highlights critical research gaps and opportunities in this domain.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of focusing on the expressive power of rational architectures, like BDI, for designing effective ML-integrated rational agents, and sets a foundation for future research efforts.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

### [35] [The Shape of Reasoning: Topological Analysis of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20665)
*Xue Wen Tan,Nathaniel Tan,Galen Lee,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Topological Data Analysis (TDA) framework for evaluating reasoning traces, outperforming classic graph metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing reasoning quality in language models are manual, unreliable, and overly simplistic, relying on graphs that fail to capture complex reasoning dynamics.

Method: A novel framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to evaluate reasoning traces using high-dimensional geometric structures, rather than traditional relational graph metrics.

Result: Topological features were found to predict reasoning quality more effectively than standard graph metrics and offered a stable indicator for trace quality.

Conclusion: The TDA framework demonstrates a clear advantage in assessing reasoning quality, paving the way for application in reinforcement learning and automated reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

*Yanlin Song,Ben Liu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiwei Hu,Qianqian Xie,Min Peng,Sophia Ananiadou,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-RFT, a two-stage framework for answering complex questions using knowledge graphs and external sources with reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods struggle to exploit knowledge graphs and large language models effectively in complex scenarios, failing at coherent multi-step planning and dealing with incomplete knowledge.

Method: Graph-RFT adopts a two-stage framework with reinforcement fine-tuning: first, chain-of-thought fine-tuning on a customized dataset to activate structured reasoning; second, a reinforcement learning process guiding planning and retrieval with multiple rewards.

Result: Graph-RFT enables structured multi-step reasoning, adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web, and resolves reasoning failures under incomplete knowledge conditions.

Conclusion: Graph-RFT improves KGQA by introducing structured reasoning with planning and retrieval scheduling, addressing key issues like incomplete knowledge and reasoning coherence.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [37] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the current measure of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) based on arithmetic means and introduces a new method, the coherence-aware measure, to better evaluate AGI progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current measures of AGI assume compensability, where strengths in one domain can offset weaknesses in others. The authors argue true AGI requires balanced competence across all essential cognitive domains.

Method: The authors propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI using an integral of generalized means over a range of compensability levels, producing an area under the curve (AUC) metric that accounts for balance and inter-domain dependency.

Result: When applied to GPT-4 and GPT-5 using the CHC cognitive domain scores, the new AUC metric shows that despite high arithmetic mean scores, these systems lack balanced competence, achieving only limited general performance (e.g., GPT-5 at 24%).

Conclusion: The coherence-adjusted AUC offers a stricter, more interpretable framework for assessing AGI, highlighting the need for balanced competence and providing a better measure for genuine progress.

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The study demonstrates the capability of generating true random numbers using simultaneous multi-row activation (SiMRA) in commercial DRAM chips with high throughput and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of using COTS DRAM chips as a source for high-throughput and low-latency true random number generation (TRNG).

Method: The study involved extensive experimental characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips using SiMRA. Tests were conducted under various parameters like activated rows, data patterns, temperatures, and spatial variations. The results were validated using the NIST statistical test suite for randomness.

Result: 1. All SiMRA-based TRNG designs passed the NIST randomness tests. 2. These designs achieved up to 1.99x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art. 3. SiMRA's entropy improved with more activated rows. 4. Operational conditions significantly influenced entropy levels.

Conclusion: SiMRA on COTS DRAM chips is a promising method for high-quality TRNG. The findings and open-source resources provide a strong base for future research and practical applications in this domain.

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to generate
true random numbers at high throughput and low latency in commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips by leveraging simultaneous multiple-row
activation (SiMRA) via an extensive characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips. We
rigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of
entropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously
activated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature
levels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we
highlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs
using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find
that all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,
16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart
DRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,
respectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of
simultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and
conditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.
For example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row
activation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,
increasing the temperature from 50{\deg}C to 90{\deg}C decreases SiMRA's
entropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation. To aid future research and development,
we open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-TRNG.

*Rubén Langarita,Jesús Alastruey-Benedé,Pablo Ibáñez-Marín,Santiago Marco-Sola,Miquel Moretó,Adrià Armejach*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Squire is a general-purpose accelerator that enhances performance and energy efficiency for dependency-bound kernels, achieving up to 7.64x speedup and 56% energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing accelerators like SIMD and GPGPUs struggle with complex data-dependency patterns and synchronization overheads, while custom FPGA/ASIC designs are costly and inflexible.

Method: The authors propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator with in-order cores capable of fine-grained parallelism and direct L2 cache access, integrated into multicore systems with minimal software changes.

Result: Squire demonstrated significant speedups (up to 7.64x in specific kernels) and an overall application acceleration of 3.66x, alongside notable energy savings and low hardware overhead.

Conclusion: Squire effectively balances flexibility, performance, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for dependency-bound kernel acceleration in multicore systems.

Abstract: Multiple HPC applications are often bottlenecked by compute-intensive kernels
implementing complex dependency patterns (data-dependency bound). Traditional
general-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain
parallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency
patterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers
(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved
performance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and
programming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different
workloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit
fine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire
accelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can
rapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2
cache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical
multicore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within
parallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate
Squire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex
dependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end
read-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups
up to 7.64$\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an
acceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\times$. In addition, Squire
reduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%
compared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automatically assess the levels of knowledge construction in informal online science learning environments and develop scalable tools for discourse analysis.

Method: The authors proposed DeBERTa-KC, extending DeBERTa-v3 with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop techniques to mitigate class imbalance and improve model generalization. They also implemented a complete end-to-end pipeline for data processing.

Result: DeBERTa-KC achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.836 in 10-fold stratified cross-validation, outperforming other models and showing particular effectiveness in detecting higher-order epistemic engagement.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the capability of transformer-based models in capturing nuanced knowledge construction indicators from online scientific discourse, making them promising tools for analyzing informal learning environments.

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

TL;DR: This paper assesses AI-generated lesson plans from five language models with three prompt frameworks for a high-school physics topic, analyzing readability, accuracy, alignment with curriculum, and cognitive demand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness and usability of AI in generating lesson plans, understanding the influence of model design and structured prompts on outcomes.

Method: It analyzed lesson plans from five models—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok—using three frameworks (TAG, RACE, COSTAR) with automated metrics for readability, accuracy, curriculum alignment, and cognitive demand.

Result: DeepSeek produced the most readable plans, Claude the densest language. The RACE framework was found to optimize factual accuracy and curriculum alignment. All models focused on lower tiers of Bloom's taxonomy with limited higher-order thinking objectives.

Conclusion: Readability is primarily influenced by the AI model, while factual accuracy and alignment depend on prompt framework design. Combining readability-optimized models with structured prompts ensures better instructional reliability.

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

Method: Introduces ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework, leveraging a two-stage training approach: synthetic error revision and an online self-correction loop with mistake-driven learning.

Result: ReDiff significantly improves coherence and factual accuracy in generated outputs, demonstrating stable and efficient parallel generation outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: ReDiff successfully mitigates error cascades by equipping models with active refinement capabilities, offering superior results and efficient generation compared to passive denoising approaches.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models

### [45] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models face scaling challenges with traditional interpretability methods due to memory constraints at long contexts. Sparse Tracing offers an efficient analytical solution with Stream, a hierarchical pruning algorithm for attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability techniques struggle with quadratic scaling and immense memory demands when analyzing LLMs with long contexts; efficient methods are needed to tackle this complexity.

Method: Sparse Tracing introduces the Stream algorithm, which dynamically sparsifies attention by estimating per-head sparse attention masks using hierarchical pruning. It operates in near-linear time ($O(T \log T)$) and linear space ($O(T)$), refining attention patterns efficiently.

Result: Stream identifies critical thought anchors and preserves essential retrieval paths while pruning 97-99% of token interactions, effectively exposing information routes in extended contexts without significant resource requirements.

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing and the Stream algorithm make long-context interpretability feasible on consumer-grade GPUs, simplifying analysis and democratizing access to chain-of-thought reasoning monitoring in LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze unstructured clinical notes in EHRs for better HIV screening and diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of early HIV diagnosis and the limitations of traditional methods that miss insights from unstructured text data in EHRs.

Method: The study proposes a pipeline employing LLMs to analyze unstructured text in EHRs and identify patients eligible for further HIV testing.

Result: Experiments using clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam showed high accuracy and low false negative rates of the proposed pipeline.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of using LLMs for processing unstructured EHR data to enhance HIV screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [47] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks 11 general-purpose large language models' (LLMs) performance in life cycle assessment (LCA) and highlights mixed results in their reliability, accuracy, and overall usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evidence and standardized evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability, robustness, and usability of LLMs in the field of life cycle assessment (LCA).

Method: The study evaluates 11 general-purpose LLMs (both commercial and open-source) across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced LCA practitioners assessed the models’ output based on criteria such as scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness, and adherence to instructions, reviewing a total of 168 outputs.

Result: 37% of LLM responses contained inaccurate or misleading information. Accuracy and explanation quality were rated average to good across many models, with no clear advantage for open-weight or closed-weight models. Hallucination rates were high (up to 40%), especially for citations.

Conclusion: While LLMs show potential for supporting LCA tasks by providing quality explanations and reducing labor, they also pose risks if used without grounding mechanisms, due to inaccuracies and hallucinations. Careful integration and evaluation are needed for their application in LCA.

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [48] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces game-based evaluations as a method to assess multi-modal large language models (MLMs), and validates this through the Dixit card game to analyze and benchmark model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of evaluating MLMs are limited as they rely on static benchmarks or subjective comparisons between models, which are prone to biases and allow exploitation of superficial shortcuts.

Method: The researchers advocate for game-based evaluations as they require diverse abilities, objective rules, and promote engagement. Specifically, they utilize the fantasy card game Dixit to evaluate MLMs' capabilities.

Result: Their quantitative experiments showed that Dixit win-rate rankings align with popular MLM benchmarks, and Dixit revealed differences in how agents strategize, along with opportunities for improving reasoning in MLMs.

Conclusion: Game-based evaluations like Dixit offer a holistic, objective, and engaging way to evaluate MLMs while highlighting areas of improvement in their reasoning and strategy.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as DeepSeek-R1 can improve optimization modeling in operations research, focusing on minimizing hallucinations and enhancing decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization heavily relies on domain expertise to define elements like objectives and constraints. LLMs can bridge gaps using natural language processing and code generation.

Method: The study evaluates DeepSeek-R1 for use in operations research across benchmarks like NL4OPT and ComplexOR, employing techniques like Few-shot Learning, Tool Calling, and Multi-agent Framework to minimize hallucinations.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates potential in improving formulation accuracy and reducing hallucinations, making it a viable alternative to models like GPT-4 in applied contexts.

Conclusion: Using DeepSeek-R1 and its unique methodologies can benefit decision-making in operations research, addressing real-world limitations of traditional models and other LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a memory-augmented framework for large language model (LLM)-based agents to learn classification functions using labeled data and LLM-generated critiques without parameter updates, outperforming standard retrieval-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make LLM-based agents more adaptive, interpretable, and efficient by avoiding costly, inflexible, and opaque fine-tuning processes.

Method: The method involves episodic memory, storing instance-level critiques, and semantic memory, distilling them into reusable, task-level guidance to improve learning and adaptability.

Result: The framework achieves up to a 24.8% accuracy improvement over retrieval-based baselines across diverse tasks, and helps interpret distinct behaviors of OpenAI and open-source models in handling different types of data.

Conclusion: Memory-driven, reflective learning has the potential to create more adaptive and interpretable LLM agents, transforming how they learn classification functions from labeled data.

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR is a new, unsupervised framework for translating lyrics, incorporating difficulty-aware and adaptive strategies for enhanced efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lyric translation methods struggle with musical-linguistic patterns and lack generalization for paragraph-level challenges like global rhyme and coherence.

Method: LyriCAR utilizes a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and adaptive strategy to efficiently train models with increasingly complex challenges.

Result: LyriCAR demonstrates superior performance in EN-ZH lyric translation, surpassing baselines, reducing training steps by 40% while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: LyriCAR improves lyric translation quality and training efficiency, offering advancements in both control and unsupervised learning techniques.

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) and symbolic natural language understanding (NLU) to improve accuracy in NLU tasks while reducing limitations of symbolic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs offer broad applicability due to probabilistic inference, they are prone to errors such as hallucination and inconsistent output structures. Symbolic NLU systems are more accurate with interpretable reasoning but lack broad coverage and require extensive linguistic expertise. The paper seeks to merge the strengths of LLMs and symbolic NLU.

Method: The hybrid approach integrates LLMs for rephrasing, text simplification, and bridging knowledge gaps, and uses symbolic NLU for generating structured relational representations for reasoning and incremental learning.

Result: The approach was tested on extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, outperforming symbolic-only and LLM-only pipelines.

Conclusion: The hybrid method effectively combines LLMs and symbolic NLU, significantly improving structured reasoning and understanding in commonsense science text interpretation over standalone symbolic systems.

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for parsing sentences into dependency trees, characterized by its one-word-at-a-time attachment. It aligns with human brain parsing behaviors and has a worst-case complexity of O(n^3).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to align computational parsing methods with natural human sentence processing, specifically through dependency tree construction.

Method: The algorithm parses sentences into dependency structures by processing one word at a time, immediately attaching words, which imitates human parsing patterns.

Result: The algorithm achieves a worst-case complexity of O(n^3), typical of natural language parsing, but this complexity is rarely encountered with human language.

Conclusion: An efficient and human-like method for natural language sentence parsing forms dependency trees, showcasing both computational viability and alignment with linguistic theories.

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies the limitations of current medical QA datasets like MedQA for real-world clinical decision-making and proposes a new paradigm to evaluate LLMs in the clinical domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between simplified QA tasks in medical datasets and the complexity of real-world clinical scenarios, providing a more meaningful framework to evaluate LLMs for clinical use.

Method: The authors propose a two-dimensional paradigm to categorize clinical decision-making tasks based on Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions, review existing datasets and methods, and extend evaluation metrics to include dimensions like efficiency and explainability.

Result: The work organizes existing clinical datasets and benchmarks, categorizes relevant methods, and proposes extended evaluation metrics, offering a structured perspective on the challenges and gaps in clinical decision-making by LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm offers a standardized framework clarifying assumptions, enabling effective comparisons, and steering the development of more clinically applicable LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces high-quality Greek Embedding Models (GEM) and novel bilingual Greek-English models for legal texts, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving natural language processing for Modern Greek, especially in specialized domains like law, constrained by limited context window models and lack of advanced architectures.

Method: Built large-scale Greek corpora using rigorous curation and filtering methods, pre-trained modern architectures (ELECTRA, ConvBERT, ModernBERT), and introduced bilingual Greek-English legal models.

Result: Extensive experiments show new models (e.g., GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT) outperform baselines in legal-domain NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Carefully curated data and diverse transformer architectures significantly enhance NLP models for Modern Greek, proving effectiveness in demanding domains like law.

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: The thesis explores enhancing sequence labeling tasks using transfer learning on pre-trained neural language models, introducing multi-task modeling, architectural modifications, and generative fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficacy of pre-trained neural language models for sequence labeling tasks through innovative transfer learning methodologies.

Method: Three core techniques are proposed: integrating domain-independent signals in a multi-task model, modifying autoregressive model architectures for bidirectional layer communication, and utilizing autoregressive models in sequence labeling via supervised in-context fine-tuning with response-oriented adaptation.

Result: The proposed improvements showcase significant advancements in the performance of pre-trained models for sequence labeling tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted transfer learning adaptations maximize the utility of pre-trained neural language models in sequence labeling tasks.

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolScope, addressing tool redundancy and context limit issues in large language model (LLM) agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face challenges with redundant and ambiguous tools, along with strict context input limits, affecting efficient tool selection.

Method: ToolScope uses two components: ToolScopeMerger to audit and correct tool redundancies automatically, and ToolScopeRetriever to rank and compress tools for better query relevance.

Result: Experiments on LLMs and benchmarks show ToolScope improves tool selection accuracy by 8.38% to 38.6%.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively enhances the tool usage of LLMs by addressing redundancy and context limit challenges.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

TL;DR: This paper presents the BLanCK dataset to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in understanding Bengali cultural knowledge and highlights the challenges faced by current models in low-resource cultural contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a critical gap in evaluating LLMs' understanding of low-resource cultures, specifically focusing on Bengali cultural knowledge, as current multilingual benchmarks fail to fully capture these nuances.

Method: The authors developed the Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge (BLanCK) dataset, which includes topics such as folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional dialects. They evaluated multiple multilingual language models on this dataset.

Result: The evaluated LLMs performed well on general categories but struggled with cultural knowledge tasks. The performance of these models improved significantly when contextual information was provided.

Conclusion: Culturally curated training data and context-aware architectures are essential to improve the ability of language models in understanding low-resource cultures like Bengali.

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: The study enhances reasoning in a Persian language model for medical question answering using Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), achieving superior performance despite using limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning capabilities in small language models for specialized applications like medical question-answering in underrepresented languages (e.g., Persian).

Method: A Persian medical dataset was created by translating multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Using the dataset, RLAIF generated rejected-preferred answer pairs for DPO training. Reasoning was prompted through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, generating datasets for training. The method highlights reasoning-focused approaches for improving capabilities.

Result: The trained model, with a smaller dataset (2-2.5 million tokens), surpassed the earlier model trained on 57 million tokens, showcasing improved medical reasoning in Persian.

Conclusion: Targeted reasoning-focused training approaches, such as RLAIF and DPO, can yield effective and efficient domain-specific language models with limited data, outperforming larger models.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

### [60] [CreativityPrism: A Holistic Benchmark for Large Language Model Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20091)
*Zhaoyi Joey Hou,Bowei Alvin Zhang,Yining Lu,Bhiman Kumar Baghel,Anneliese Brei,Ximing Lu,Meng Jiang,Faeze Brahman,Snigdha Chaturvedi,Haw-Shiuan Chang,Daniel Khashabi,Xiang Lorraine Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called CreativityPrism to holistically evaluate the creativity of large language models (LLMs) across three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity, using nine tasks and twenty metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented and inconsistent approaches in evaluating LLM creativity, which lack a unified framework and comprehensive definitions.

Method: The authors propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation framework divided into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity, encompassing nine tasks across three domains (divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning), with twenty metrics tailored to measure creativity.

Result: The study tested 17 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on CreativityPrism and found that proprietary models outperform open-source ones, performance across tasks within the same domain is more correlated, and novelty tends to have weak correlation with quality or diversity.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that strong performance in certain creativity tasks or dimensions does not generalize, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to evaluate LLM creativity.

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

### [61] [Leveraging the Power of Large Language Models in Entity Linking via Adaptive Routing and Targeted Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20098)
*Yajie Li,Albert Galimov,Mitra Datta Ganapaneni,Pujitha Thejaswi,De Meng,Priyanshu Kumar,Saloni Potdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARTER, an efficient entity linking pipeline combining scoring, routing, and reasoning strategies, achieving high performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional entity linking methods require extensive annotated datasets and fine-tuning, and existing few-shot approaches using LLMs are computationally inefficient.

Method: The proposed ARTER pipeline uses candidate generation, context-scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning with low and high-computational tools, categorizing cases for efficient handling.

Result: ARTER outperforms existing models by up to +4.47% on benchmarks and achieves high efficiency, requiring half the LLM tokens compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: ARTER enhances entity linking performance with a structured approach, optimizing both accuracy and computational efficiency by strategically combining methods.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

### [62] [BoundRL: Efficient Structured Text Segmentation through Reinforced Boundary Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20151)
*Haoyuan Li,Zhengyuan Shen,Sullam Jeoung,Yueyan Chen,Jiayu Li,Qi Zhu,Shuai Wang,Vassilis Ioannidis,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoundRL is a reinforcement learning approach to text segmentation in complex structured texts, focusing on token-level segmentation and label prediction while optimizing document reconstruction and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of structured texts across domains highlights the need for effective segmentation methods that handle diverse elements like tables, code, and placeholders.

Method: The proposed BoundRL uses token-level segmentation, locating starting tokens to reconstruct contents efficiently, paired with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for optimizing fidelity and semantic alignment. Intermediate candidates are generated to mitigate entropy collapse.

Result: Experiments show BoundRL enables smaller language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of larger ones. RLVR with the designed reward achieves better results compared to supervised fine-tuning, and intermediate candidates boost performance further.

Conclusion: BoundRL is a novel solution for segmenting complex structured texts, advancing efficiency and accuracy, and effectively optimizing semantic alignment and reconstruction fidelity in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

### [63] [Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20154)
*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores biases in Large Language Models, specifically in stance detection tasks, revealing stereotypes associated with dialect and text complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation of biases in stance detection, a sensitive NLP task where models may exhibit biased behavior.

Method: Automatically annotated posts in existing stance detection datasets with attributes like dialect and text complexity to study their influence on LLM decisions in zero-shot scenarios.

Result: LLMs exhibited stereotypes, such as associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American dialect with opposition to Trump.

Conclusion: Biases ingrained in LLMs significantly affect their performance in stance detection, highlighting the need for more comprehensive bias evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

*Tian Lan,Bin Zhu,Qianghuai Jia,Junyang Ren,Haijun Li,Longyue Wang,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepWideSearch, a benchmark for evaluating search agents' ability to perform both deep reasoning and wide-scale information collection, essential for tasks like market analysis. Current state-of-the-art agents struggle on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search agents need to conduct both multi-hop (deep) reasoning and wide-scale (breadth) information gathering to solve complex, real-world problems, but current agents lack these capabilities.

Method: The researchers developed DeepWideSearch, a curated dataset of 220 questions across 15 domains, and analyzed agents' performance. They also identified four failure modes hindering progress: lack of reflection, excessive reliance on built-in knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow.

Result: Even state-of-the-art search agents achieve a low success rate of 2.39% on the DeepWideSearch benchmark, revealing significant challenges in combining depth and width in information retrieval.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for advancements in search agent architectures to better integrate deep reasoning and wide-scale retrieval capabilities. The public release of DeepWideSearch aims to stimulate further research in this area.

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

*Yuhang Zhou,Mingrui Zhang,Ke Li,Mingyi Wang,Qiao Liu,Qifei wang,Jiayi Liu,Fei Liu,Serena Li,Weiwi Li,Mingze Gao,Abhishek Kumar,Xiangjun Fan,Zhuokai Zhao,Lizhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Mixture-of-Minds,' a multi-agent framework integrating reasoning and precise table manipulation for improved table understanding tasks with reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in LLM-based table reasoning approaches, such as arithmetic errors and hallucinations, while improving semantic understanding and reliability in table manipulation.

Method: The authors propose 'Mixture-of-Minds,' a framework where table reasoning tasks are decomposed into specialized agent roles (planning, coding, and answering) and employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) alongside reinforcement learning to optimize performance.

Result: Mixture-of-Minds achieved significant improvements in table reasoning accuracy, reporting 62.13% on TableBench and surpassing performance benchmarks like OpenAI-o4-mini-high.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent workflows combined with reinforcement learning represent a promising direction for advancing the understanding and processing of tabular data.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates large language models' ability to perform spatial reasoning tasks and finds that their performance consistently deteriorates as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the capability and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in performing spatial reasoning tasks, particularly when dealing with increasing complexity and structured environments.

Method: The authors devised five tasks (quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile sliding) in grid-based environments to test LLMs on spatial reasoning, scaling the difficulty through increasing grid dimensions.

Result: LLMs showed moderate success in simple tasks but faced significant performance declines with increasing complexity, with an average accuracy drop of 42.7% and as high as 84% for larger-scale tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs lack robust spatial reasoning abilities, particularly when task complexity increases, highlighting a gap in integrating linguistic and geometric reasoning, and pointing to the need for improved methods or benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

### [67] [Decoding-Free Sampling Strategies for LLM Marginalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20208)
*David Pohl,Marco Cognetta,Junyoung Lee,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses efficient decoding-free sampling strategies to approximate marginalization for evaluating language models, focusing on speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of traditional sampling methods for marginalizing language model evaluations, which require expensive and time-consuming generation steps.

Method: The authors propose decoding-free sampling strategies that avoid any generation from language models, being both model and tokenizer agnostic, and significantly reducing computational costs.

Result: The decoding-free sampling strategies offer accurate approximations of marginal estimates with vastly reduced runtime costs compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows promise in providing efficient and scalable evaluation methods for language models, with applications for downstream inference tasks.

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using tri-modal affective analysis (text, audio, and facial signals) to provide severity-aware diagnosis for depression and PTSD, outperforming unimodal systems and improving robustness and decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated system for diagnosing depression and PTSD with severity-aware, cross-disorder estimates and explanations to support clinical decision making.

Method: A tri-modal affective fusion framework integrating text embeddings, audio signals, and facial cues. It employs a calibrated late fusion classifier for probability outputs and feature-level attributions, along with stratified cross-validation to assess effectiveness.

Result: The proposed fusion model performed better than unimodal or ablation baselines in accuracy, robustness, and decision curve utility. It effectively identified extreme classes and showed reduced errors for PTSD severity estimates.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible, robust model that supports clinicians in diagnosing depression and PTSD, with insight into important linguistic and behavioral markers of these conditions.

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM introduces next-context prediction in LLMs to enhance semantic and contextual understanding beyond token-level prediction, improving perplexity and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs rely on next-token prediction for pretraining, but this restricts their ability to grasp higher-level semantics and long-range contexts.

Method: ContextLM incorporates next-context prediction, training the model with future token chunks and maintaining compatibility with traditional autoregressive evaluation methods.

Result: ContextLM improves perplexity and downstream task performance in GPT2 and Pythia models up to 1.5B parameters, enhancing coherence and attention allocation.

Conclusion: Next-context prediction enhances language modeling with better long-range coherence and efficiency, offering a promising and scalable improvement over standard methods.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of citation failure in LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, proposing a two-step approach to understand why it occurs and how to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplifying response verification in LLM-based RAG systems is undermined by citation failures, where models fail to provide complete evidence for their responses. Understanding and improving this aspect is essential for enhancing the credibility and reliability of these systems.

Method: The authors introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark for analyzing citation failure through variations in the relationship between responses and evidence. They propose CITENTION, a novel framework combining generative, attention-based, and retrieval methods to enhance citation quality.

Result: Experiments with CITECONTROL show that citation failures increase with relational complexity. The proposed CITENTION framework demonstrates significant improvements in citation quality both on the CITECONTROL dataset and in transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: Disentangling citation failure from response failure allows for targeted improvements in citation mechanisms. The proposed methods show promise in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of citations in LLM-based systems, with openly shared resources for further research.

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

*Lei Tang,Wei Zhou,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates Process Reward Models (PRMs) in enhancing large language models' reasoning abilities, particularly in table question answering (TQA), and highlights their limitations in generalizing and handling step-level dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to explore whether PRMs, which are successful in iterative reasoning tasks like mathematics, can be effective in table question answering (TQA), a domain with unique challenges such as irrelevant information and weak causal reasoning between steps.

Method: The study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA tasks by assessing their performance both at the answer level and step-validation level. It investigates the combination of textual and code verification methods.

Result: PRMs that integrate textual and code verification demonstrate some effectiveness in solution selection but fail to generalize to out-of-domain data. Additionally, the performance at the step-level does not strongly correlate with overall answer accuracy due to weak dependencies between reasoning steps.

Conclusion: Current PRMs show promise but face significant limitations in handling the complexity of TQA tasks. Future work should focus on addressing these challenges, such as enhancing step-level dependency analysis and developing better process-aware verification methods.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoRT, a framework to optimize the use of Code Interpreters (CIs) in large reasoning models like OpenAI-o1, enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of large reasoning models (LRMs) when performing complex mathematical operations. These models struggle due to the conflict between internal probabilistic reasoning and external deterministic CI knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes CoRT (Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework employing Hint-Engineering for strategic data synthesis, rejection sampling, and reinforcement learning to improve the interaction between LRMs and CIs.

Result: Using CoRT, models (1.5B to 32B parameters) achieved 4% and 8% absolute improvements across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets, while reducing token usage by 30% (for 32B models) and 50% (for 1.5B models).

Conclusion: CoRT enhances the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs for complex mathematical reasoning by optimizing their interface with computational tools. The approach introduces scalable improvements across model sizes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances

*Matteo Silvestri,Flavio Giorgi,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates dataset contamination in evaluations of LLMs on tabular benchmarks, revealing the role of semantic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs genuinely generalize or leverage prior knowledge of dataset content in reasoning over structured data.

Method: Controlled probing experiments were used to test LLM reasoning with original datasets compared to datasets with randomized semantic cues.

Result: LLMs performed well only on datasets with strong semantic cues; removing such cues reduced their performance to near-random levels.

Conclusion: LLMs' reasoning on structured data may rely on memorization rather than genuine generalization, calling for improved evaluation protocols to separate semantic leakage from reasoning ability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

*Wenxuan Zhang,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Yonghe Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeChunker, a framework for flexible chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chunking methods in RAG systems rely on fixed boundaries, limiting adaptability to diverse queries and increasing computational overhead.

Method: FreeChunker shifts from static chunk segmentation to treating sentences as atomic units, allowing arbitrary combinations of sentences for flexible retrieval.

Result: FreeChunker demonstrates better retrieval performance and computational efficiency compared to traditional chunking methods on LongBench V2.

Conclusion: FreeChunker fundamentally transforms traditional chunking by offering adaptability and efficiency in RAG systems, marking a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

*Francesca Padovani,Bastian Bunzeck,Manar Ali,Omar Momen,Arianna Bisazza,Hendrik Buschmeier,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates if pre-training small language models on dialogue data improves their communication capabilities, outperforming in specific dialogue-related tasks but underperforming in general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to determine whether focusing solely on dialogue data during pre-training can yield small language models that are effective in dialogue-specific tasks and communicative text generation.

Method: The study involves pre-training a model (llamalogue) on dialogue data, followed by varied fine-tuning techniques, including PPO and DPO, to optimize performance on dialogue-related tasks.

Result: The model underperformed on general BabyLM benchmarks but excelled at tasks requiring dialogue continuation prediction within a minimal pair setting. DPO fine-tuning enhanced performance on a custom dialogue benchmark, while PPO fine-tuning had mixed or negative effects.

Conclusion: Pre-training on dialogue-specific data creates models better suited for dialogue tasks, with DPO fine-tuning showing the most promise, albeit at the cost of general applicability on broader benchmarks.

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

*Jaehyung Seo,Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of negated text on hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the unexplored challenge of determining how negated text affects the ability of LLMs to identify hallucinations.

Method: Researchers designed the NegHalu dataset by modifying existing hallucination datasets with negated expressions and studied the behavior of LLMs in recognizing contextual shifts and distinguishing hallucinations effectively.

Result: Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with hallucination detection in negated text, often resulting in logically inconsistent judgments. Token-level analysis highlights challenges in addressing these issues.

Conclusion: LLMs face difficulties with processing negated inputs related to hallucination detection, demonstrating a need for improved handling of contextual shifts caused by negation.

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

TL;DR: The paper introduces new BERT-style models (NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual) designed for Hebrew text processing, outperforming existing benchmarks and advancing Hebrew NLP research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the outdated architectural choices in original BERT models and improve Hebrew text processing capabilities in NLP.

Method: They trained NeoDictaBERT models using the NeoBERT architecture, specifically focusing on Hebrew texts and benchmarks.

Result: NeoDictaBERT models outperformed existing Hebrew benchmarks and demonstrated strong performance, especially in retrieval tasks, compared to multilingual models of similar size.

Conclusion: The release of NeoDictaBERT models aims to promote Hebrew NLP research and support downstream processing tasks effectively.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ContingentChat, a framework to enhance contingency in caregiver-child-like dialogues using a BabyLM model trained on 100M words, and highlights targeted post-training benefits with limited gains from adaptive teacher strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of improving contingency in multi-turn dialogues, particularly modeled after caregiver-child interactions.

Method: Introduce ContingentChat framework for benchmarking and improving dialogue quality via targeted post-training using an alignment dataset. Experimented with adaptive teacher decoding strategies.

Result: Post-training resulted in more grammatical and cohesive responses, though adaptive decoding showed limited additional improvements.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training enhances dialogue quality but achieving high contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLM models.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

*Zhijie Deng,Zhouan Shen,Ling Li,Yao Zhou,Zhaowei Zhu,Yanji He,Wei Wang,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of Instruction Distillation to transform low-quality, redundant inputs into high-quality instruction-output pairs through a novel pipeline and method called LM-Mixup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of high-quality instruction-following data and leverage low-quality data, which is often discarded, by creating methods for effective augmentation and distillation.

Method: The authors define Instruction Distillation and propose LM-Mixup, which includes a supervised fine-tuning on the MIXTURE dataset and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization using rewards based on quality, semantic alignment, and format compliance.

Result: Training LLMs on distilled data using LM-Mixup, which constitutes only 3% of the dataset, surpasses full-dataset training and rivals state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Low-quality data, when effectively distilled and augmented using LM-Mixup, is a valuable resource for enhancing the performance and efficiency of instruction-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

*Christian Hobelsberger,Theresa Winner,Andreas Nawroth,Oliver Mitevski,Anna-Carolina Haensch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates methods for estimating confidence in LLM outputs, highlighting CoCoA as the most reliable approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce uncertain or incorrect outputs, necessitating reliable confidence estimation tools.

Method: Four methods—VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA—are evaluated through experiments on four question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM.

Result: Different metrics capture unique aspects of model confidence, with CoCoA demonstrating superior reliability and improving calibration and discrimination.

Conclusion: CoCoA is recommended as an effective hybrid uncertainty estimation method, with insights into trade-offs among other approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve language modeling techniques for better performance in tasks such as (Super)GLUE.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive Masked Language Modeling approach, adjusting masking probabilities based on model prediction ability, and incorporate sub-token embeddings.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial performance gains on (Super)GLUE tasks and outperforms the baseline in the strict-small track.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance morphological generalization and improve overall model performance, marking a notable contribution to the BabyLM Challenge.

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling
(MLM), which adapts the probabilities of the tokens masked according to the
model's ability to predict them. The results show a substantial increase in
performance on (Super)GLUE tasks over the standard MLM. We also incorporate
sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the
strict-small track.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RECALL, a method for merging language models in continual learning scenarios without needing historical data, showing strong performance in preventing knowledge forgetting and enabling domain integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study targets the issue of continual learning in large language models, specifically addressing challenges in preserving knowledge and integrating multiple domains without historical data.

Method: The authors developed RECALL, a model merging framework that uses inter-model similarity through hidden representations and adaptive parameter fusion to align and merge knowledge across models effectively.

Result: The RECALL approach demonstrated superior performance in retention and generalization across five NLP tasks and various continual learning scenarios, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: RECALL serves as a scalable and effective data-free solution for continual learning in large language models, achieving multi-domain learning and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces activation steering to suppress evaluation-awareness in LLMs during evaluations, ensuring a closer resemblance to their deployment behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about large language models exhibiting evaluation-aware behavior, which can compromise the reliability of safety evaluations.

Method: Implemented a two-step training process to induce evaluation-awareness in LLMs, followed by activation steering to suppress this behavior during evaluations.

Result: The trained model exhibited evaluation-awareness but activation steering successfully reduced this behavior, encouraging it to act similarly to deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Activation steering is a promising technique that can enhance the reliability of safety evaluations for LLMs by addressing evaluation-awareness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [85] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Robust Preference Selection (RPS) is a training-free method to address gaps in aligning large language models with diverse human preferences, achieving improved alignment and robustness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can struggle to meet nuanced, individual user preferences, resulting in unpredictable model performance due to the dominance of average preferences in training data.

Method: The paper introduces RPS, a post-hoc method that samples multiple responses from a neighborhood of related preferences, selects the best alternative aligning with user's original intent, and enhances robustness without retraining the model.

Result: RPS consistently improves alignment robustness against baselines, demonstrated by win rates up to 69% in experimental validation across three paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT).

Conclusion: RPS provides a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to enhance preference alignment in large language models, addressing diverse user needs effectively and reducing the reliance on expensive retraining methods.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration for heterogeneous question answering, improving efficiency and accuracy across diverse data formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in handling multi-step questions and diverse evidence sources while balancing accuracy, latency, and resources.

Method: The authors introduce the HSEQ framework with hierarchical sequence linearization, structure-aware iteration, and evidence canonicalization. It employs a Head Agent for retrieval guidance and an Iteration Agent for evidence collection and integration.

Result: Experiments across various datasets (HotpotQA, HybridQA, TAT-QA, MetaQA) show consistent improvements in accuracy (EM/F1 scores) and efficiency compared to existing RAG approaches.

Conclusion: HSEQ provides a unified, format-agnostic solution for question answering, enhancing reliability, efficiency, and evidence integration across diverse data sources.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

TL;DR: The paper examines political biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) through multilingual translation fairness, analyzing European Parliament speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative methods of assessing political biases in LLMs, especially in multilingual contexts, using principles of fairness rather than traditional English surveys.

Method: The study involves systematic comparison of translation quality for European Parliament speeches, categorized by speakers' political affiliations, using a new 21-way multiparallel dataset of EP proceedings.

Result: The research found systematic translation quality differences, with mainstream political parties receiving better translations compared to outsider parties.

Conclusion: Political biases manifest in multilingual LLM translations, highlighting fairness challenges in translation models, particularly concerning political diversity and representation.

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARC-Encoder, a context compression encoder that reduces inference costs without modifying LLM architecture. It achieves high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost associated with long contexts and inference in advanced techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Designing an ARC-Encoder that compresses context into continuous representations, with systematic studies informing training and architecture choices. It minimizes token embeddings fed into decoder LLMs.

Result: ARC-Encoder yielded state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks, improved computational efficiency, and adapted well across multiple decoder LLMs.

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder offers a flexible and portable solution to compress context efficiently while maintaining performance across multiple LLMs without requiring model fine-tuning or modifications.

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Method: CenterBench dataset with 9,720 comprehension questions is utilized to compare models’ ability to handle plausible versus implausible sentences. Six comprehension questions probe syntax understanding, causal reasoning, and surface comprehension.

Result: Testing six models reveals significant performance gaps. Models increasingly abandon syntactic analysis for semantic shortcuts in complex sentences, struggling particularly where causal reasoning is required, despite advances in reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: CenterBench provides an essential tool to identify when language models shift their focus from analyzing structure to relying on semantic pattern matching as complexity increases. Human responses show a more variable approach, unlike models' systematic behavior.

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

### [90] [GlobalRAG: Enhancing Global Reasoning in Multi-hop Question Answering via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20548)
*Jinchang Luo,Mingquan Cheng,Fan Wan,Ni Li,Xiaoling Xia,Shuangshuang Tian,Tingcheng Bian,Haiwei Wang,Haohuan Fu,Yan Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG introduces a reinforcement learning framework to improve multi-hop question answering by emphasizing coherent planning and reliable execution of subgoals, outperforming baselines with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in multi-hop QA, particularly the absence of global reasoning and unfaithful execution in query formulation and evidence usage.

Method: The framework decomposes questions into subgoals, iteratively refines evidence, and employs rewards for planning quality and subgoal completion, coupled with progressive weight annealing.

Result: GlobalRAG significantly outperforms strong baselines by achieving improvements of 14.2% in EM and F1 scores, using only 42% of the training data compared to competitors.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning frameworks like GlobalRAG can enhance multi-hop QA through structured planning and improved evidence use, even with reduced training resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF) to improve e-commerce search by shifting focus from query-item matching to proactive decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current retrieval-ranking paradigm in e-commerce search struggles with semantic gaps, high user decision costs, and lacks shopping guidance, misaligning with complex user decision-making processes.

Method: The authors propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF) designed to support users actively in their decision-making through multi-agent systems, addressing complex query requirements.

Result: Offline evaluations show improved recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction, particularly for complex queries. Online A/B testing on JD search platform demonstrates its effectiveness in a practical setting.

Conclusion: MACDF showcases the transformative potential for redefining e-commerce search by better aligning search systems with user decision processes, enhancing user satisfaction and outcomes.

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether ChatGPT-based communication data coding exhibits demographic bias across gender and race. Results show no significant bias, enabling its use for large-scale assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the possibility of demographic bias in ChatGPT-based coding for communication and collaboration data, ensuring fair and accurate automated assessment.

Method: ChatGPT was instructed to code communication data using a typical framework for collaborative problem solving. The study analyzed three types of tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision making, examining bias across demographic groups.

Result: The study found no significant bias in ChatGPT's coding across gender and racial groups for the tasks analyzed.

Conclusion: ChatGPT is a viable tool for unbiased, large-scale assessment of communication and collaboration data, promoting fairness and efficiency in coding tasks.

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

*Haoyu Wang,Sihang Jiang,Yuyan Chen,Yitong Wang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) mimic human-like curiosity using a specialized evaluation framework based on the 5DCR scale. Findings show LLMs demonstrate high thirst for knowledge but remain cautious in uncertain conditions. Enhanced curiosity in LLMs positively impacts reasoning and active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether LLMs can exhibit curiosity-driven learning akin to humans, similar to human cognitive functions.

Method: A comprehensive evaluation framework was created, using the Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), assessing dimensions including Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social Curiosity.

Result: LLMs showed a higher thirst for knowledge compared to humans but made cautious choices in uncertain environments, and curiosity enhanced reasoning and active learning abilities.

Conclusion: LLMs possess human-like curiosity traits, offering insights to advance their learning and innovative research potential.

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

*Alan Saji,Raj Dabre,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Ratish Puduppully*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the multilingual reasoning abilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), highlighting that English reasoning generally yields higher accuracy but is prone to translation errors when handling non-English tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the multilingual capabilities of LRMs and evaluate their reasoning performance in English versus the original language of non-English questions.

Method: A systematic comparison of LRMs' reasoning in English versus native languages across tasks such as MGSM and GPQA Diamond, analyzing answer accuracy and cognitive behaviors in reasoning traces.

Result: English reasoning generally offers higher final-answer accuracy and exhibits more cognitive behaviors, but it introduces errors during translation when handling complex tasks in non-English languages.

Conclusion: While LRMs excel with English-centric reasoning, their reliance on translation can lead to errors, highlighting the need for improved handling of linguistic nuances in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

*Junghyun Min,York Hay Ng,Sophia Chan,Helena Shunhua Zhao,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CantoNLU, a new benchmark for evaluating Cantonese NLP with seven tasks and compares different model performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to policy and diglossia, Cantonese suffers from a lack of resources, and there is a need for evaluation frameworks to advance Cantonese NLP.

Method: The authors created CantoNLU, a benchmark covering syntax and semantics across seven tasks. They evaluated baseline performances of models, including Cantonese-adapted and Mandarin models.

Result: Cantonese-adapted models performed best overall, monolingual models excelled in syntactic tasks, and Mandarin models demonstrated some competitive performance due to direct transferability.

Conclusion: Cantonese-adapted models are effective for Cantonese NLP, suggesting domain adaptation approaches while releasing resources to support development in this field.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

*Kushal Chakrabarti,Nirmal Balachundhar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes neural diversity as a mechanism to reduce hallucinations in language models at fixed computational and data budgets, validated through the ND-LoRA approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent hallucinations in language models despite increases in parameters, compute, and data.

Method: Introduces ND-LoRA, which combines parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization to reduce hallucination rates, supported by theoretical frameworks inspired by portfolio theory.

Result: ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% (average 14.6%) without degrading general accuracy, with ablations and interventions showing neurodiversity as a mediating factor.

Conclusion: Neural diversity is presented as a new axis of scaling, alongside parameters and data, to enhance language model reliability at fixed resource budgets.

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

### [98] [Structure-Conditional Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20700)
*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Enhanced MBR decoding and emphasizes adjusting the utility functions for better sensitivity to structural variability, showing marked improvements in performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges with standard MBR decoding in open-ended tasks like dialogue and instruction-following, particularly due to its limitations in handling latent structural variability in response generation.

Method: The authors propose three lightweight adaptations for MBR utility functions and introduce a curated dataset with latent structures (dialogue act, emotion, and response structure) to evaluate these adaptations. Additionally, two new structural optimality metrics for MBR evaluation are introduced.

Result: The proposed utility function adaptations improve structural sensitivity, demonstrating better performance on curated structural datasets. Real-world benchmarks show up to a 13.7% increase in quality win rates in instruction-following tasks.

Conclusion: Standard similarity-based utility functions for MBR decoding struggle with structural variability in open-ended tasks. The adapted utility functions enhance structural optimality and generation quality, making MBR more effective for such scenarios.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [99] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how users perceive the privacy-preservation and helpfulness of large language model (LLM) responses, finding major variability among users and poor alignment between proxy LLM evaluations and real user evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs handle privacy-sensitive information is crucial for ensuring trust in their adoption for tasks involving private or sensitive user data.

Method: The researchers conducted a user study with 94 participants using 90 privacy-sensitive scenarios from PrivacyLens and evaluated user agreement with privacy-preservation and helpfulness of responses by LLMs.

Result: Users showed low agreement on the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses, while proxy LLMs had high agreement among themselves but poor correlation with users' evaluations.

Conclusion: The study reveals that perceptions of privacy and helpfulness are user-specific and proxy LLMs fail to estimate user evaluations accurately. Future research should focus on user-centered studies and improving proxy LLMs’ alignment with real user perceptions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops and evaluates NLP methods for extracting treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes of colorectal and breast cancer patients. LLM-based approaches performed the best, achieving high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting crucial treatment and toxicity information about fluoropyrimidines from unstructured clinical notes for better oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Method: Constructed a gold-standard annotated dataset of 236 clinical notes, employing rule-based, machine learning, deep learning (BERT/ClinicalBERT), and LLM-based NLP approaches. Models were trained and tested using an 80:20 train-test split.

Result: LLM-based methods achieved the best performance (F1=1.000 for treatment and toxicities extraction in error-analysis prompting). Rule-based and traditional machine learning methods provided competitive results, while deep learning underperformed due to limited data.

Conclusion: LLM-based NLP approaches are the most effective for extracting relevant data about fluoropyrimidine-related treatments and toxicities, promising significant benefits for oncology research and pharmacovigilance applications.

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

TL;DR: The study explores large reasoning models (LRMs) as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality, proposing calibration strategies to improve their performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent improvements in LRMs incorporate intermediate reasoning steps for better task performance, but their application in MT evaluation is underexplored, prompting the study.

Method: The paper trains LRMs using synthetic human-like thinking trajectories to optimize their evaluation efficiency and accuracy on MT tasks.

Result: Calibration reduces thinking budgets by ~35x and improves evaluation with correlation points increased by +8.7 for models like R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across various LRM scales.

Conclusion: Tailored evaluations and calibrated reasoning processes enable LRMs to efficiently enhance MT quality assessments, demonstrating their promising capabilities in fine-grained evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper presents a dataset for evaluating fairness in language models, tailored to real-world applications like product description generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to evaluate large language models for Responsible AI dimensions, such as fairness, since current evaluations often fail to take application-specific relevance of protected attributes into account.

Method: The authors created a dataset focused on writing product descriptions intersected with fairness attributes, gendered adjectives, and product categories. The data is used to measure quality, safety, veracity, and fairness gaps in LLMs.

Result: The proposed dataset provides a detailed evaluation resource, helping identify shortcomings in LLMs regarding fairness and other dimensions.

Conclusion: A new approach to evaluate LLMs for fairness in specific AI applications has been introduced, along with a tailored dataset to guide future research in Responsible AI.

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

*Mutian He,Philip N. Garner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes hybrid linear-attention models with sparsity-related mechanisms and a novel learnable token eviction approach to mitigate forgetfulness in retrieval-intensive tasks, maintaining efficiency while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear-attention models struggle with forgetfulness in retrieving information for intensive tasks due to their fixed memory capacity. Addressing this limitation could significantly enhance both effectiveness and efficiency in handling large sequences.

Method: The authors integrate hybrid models with intermediate complexity between linear and full attention, utilizing sparse attention mechanisms, learnable token eviction methods combined with sliding-window attention, and lightweight CNNs to manage memory while retaining crucial token information.

Result: The proposed approaches, implemented with efficient Triton kernels, showed improved performance on retrieval-intensive benchmarks, demonstrating their efficacy and maintaining lower computational demands.

Conclusion: The hybrid linear-attention models, with novel sparsity mechanisms and token eviction strategies, successfully mitigate forgetfulness issues while retaining efficiency, making them applicable for retrieval-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mean-pooling-based soft context compression approach for retrieval-augmented generation in LLMs, outperforming existing methods in several experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational costs of using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation can be high, so efficient compression methods are necessary.

Method: The proposed method applies a lightweight and simple mean-pooling algorithm to compress input sequences and trains it with multiple compression ratios.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets, model families, scales, and compression ratios confirmed the superior performance of the mean-pooling approach, even with minimal performance drop for multi-ratio training.

Conclusion: Mean-pooling demonstrates robust performance for context compression in LLMs, but trade-offs in compression methods remain nuanced depending on architectures and training regimes.

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

*Mingmeng Geng,Thierry Poibeau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of detecting text generated by large language models, highlighting the lack of clear definitions and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to detect text generated by LLMs, but the lack of clear definitions, the diversity of LLMs, and blurred lines between human and LLM-generated text complicate detection.

Method: The paper analyzes current detection benchmarks and approaches, emphasizing their limitations in real-world scenarios.

Result: Detection efforts are significantly hindered by the absence of standardized targets and inadequate benchmarks for diverse LLM scenarios.

Conclusion: Detectors are useful in specific situations but results should only be treated as references, not definitive indicators.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones using frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning, achieving high accuracy (92.8%) with ResNet50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of photorealistic StyleGAN-generated images presents challenges for ensuring image authenticity in forensics and industrial systems.

Method: The authors employed a two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) to reveal periodic artifacts in the Fourier domain, training a ResNet50 neural network for classification.

Result: The frequency-domain model significantly outperformed spatial-domain models, achieving 92.8% accuracy and an AUC of 0.95.

Conclusion: StyleGAN-generated images contain distinct frequency-domain fingerprints, making the proposed method effective for enhancing digital forensics and improving industrial AI systems' reliability.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning objectives for effective 3D shape representation from 2D images, achieving 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of CNNs in understanding 3D shapes from 2D images, which struggle with capturing crucial shape relationships and require extensive labeled data.

Method: Combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) with contrastive learning (both supervised and self-supervised) to enable effective global and local shape feature representation.

Result: The approach achieved promising performance, including 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10 dataset, by capturing global semantics and refining local features.

Conclusion: Using ViTs with modern contrastive learning objectives effectively improves 3D representation learning, addressing CNN limitations in shape recognition and reducing dependence on labeled data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack presents a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework leveraging a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker for robust object tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D multi-object tracking performance by leveraging multimodal sensor inputs (camera and LiDAR) and transformer-based tracking approaches.

Method: FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer pipeline with a fusion-driven tracker that integrates bounding boxes with bird's-eye-view fusion features, without requiring an explicit motion model.

Result: FutrTrack achieves an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, showcasing significant improvement in multimodal tracking performance compared to single-sensor approaches.

Conclusion: FutrTrack effectively improves 3D multi-object tracking benchmarks, demonstrating robust identity assignment and propagation across frames using multimodal features, suitable for scenarios with limited data and no pretraining.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic method for improving classification accuracy and reliability in medical imaging using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models, although successful in medical image classification, often produce overly confident predictions, which can compromise their reliability in healthcare applications. Addressing overconfidence is critical for developing trustworthy AI systems.

Method: Online Label Smoothing (OLS) dynamically adjusts labels throughout training based on the model's prediction patterns. The method was evaluated on RadImageNet dataset using ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 architectures.

Result: OLS consistently improved Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to conventional training methods. It also resulted in compact and well-separated feature embeddings, enhancing representation learning.

Conclusion: OLS enhances predictive performance and calibration, offering a reliable solution for trustworthy AI in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

TL;DR: This study enhances object detection in fisheye camera imagery for traffic surveillance, overcoming distortion challenges using pre/post processing and model ensemble techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties posed by fisheye cameras, such as distortion and resolution issues, for traffic surveillance.

Method: The approach utilizes pre/post processing for image distortion correction and employs ensemble strategies with state-of-the-art detection models.

Result: The method achieved an F1 score of 0.6366 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, ranking 8th out of 62 teams.

Conclusion: The framework successfully mitigates distortion effects in fisheye imagery while improving traffic object detection performance.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual noise in 3D Gaussian Splatting models when viewed from extrapolated camera angles. It introduces a render-aware filtering method that improves visual fidelity in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the problem of visual artifacts caused by camera angles outside the distribution of training data in 3D reconstruction models.

Method: The approach uses sensitivity scores derived from intermediate gradients, specifically targeting anisotropic instabilities.

Result: The method significantly enhances visual quality and consistency compared to prior Neural Radiance Field-based methods like BayesRays.

Conclusion: The filtering method efficiently integrates into existing rendering pipelines, providing real-time improvements in 3D rendering quality without requiring retraining.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [112] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework, BrainPuzzle, that effectively reconstructs speed-of-sound maps for ultrasound brain imaging, addressing key challenges caused by skull-induced attenuation and sparse aperture setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound brain imaging faces challenges such as skull-induced sound speed differences, weak signals, and incomplete coverage due to sparse apertures, creating a need for a robust reconstruction method.

Method: The paper proposes BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage framework combining reverse time migration for structural details with transformer-based super-resolution for fusing data into accurate speed-of-sound maps.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate BrainPuzzle's ability to achieve superior reconstruction accuracy and completeness in speed-of-sound maps.

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle shows potential to advance quantitative ultrasound imaging of the brain by overcoming technical limitations and enabling accurate imaging.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates cultural biases in generative image models, focusing on text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) editing, using reproducible methods across six countries and multiple categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative image models often misrepresent cultural diversity, defaulting to biases such as Global North representations and eroding cultural fidelity in cross-country scenarios.

Method: The study uses a unified evaluation framework with an 8-category schema, era-specific prompts, automatic metrics, culture-aware VQA, and expert judgments by native reviewers. It includes evaluations across countries, eras, and categories and provides reproducible protocols.

Result: (1) Country-agnostic prompts default to Global-North, modern depictions. (2) Iterative I2I editing reduces cultural fidelity despite stable or improved conventional metrics. (3) I2I models often retain Global-South targets' source identity while applying superficial edits, indicating unreliable culture-sensitive editing.

Conclusion: Current generative image models have significant cultural biases and fail at reliable culture-sensitive editing. The paper provides reproducible tools for benchmarking this issue and stresses the importance of addressing cultural fidelity in generative systems.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [114] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIBAR, a simpler filter-based method to reconstruct intensity images from event camera data, running on a CPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction methods rely on complex neural networks requiring GPUs, which are resource-intensive. A simpler method that can operate efficiently on CPUs is desirable.

Method: FIBAR integrates event-detected intensity changes using a temporal digital filter and reduces noise via regulation of stale pixels, followed by Gaussian filtering for stationary regions.

Result: The proposed method achieves real-time processing of 42 million events per second on a modern CPU. Reconstructed images are noisier with ghosting compared to neural networks but are usable for specific tasks like fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: FIBAR offers a lightweight, asynchronous, and resource-efficient alternative for event camera image reconstruction, suitable for specific applications despite noisier outputs compared to neural networks.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TBTLRR, a novel tensor low-rank representation model designed to improve image clustering performance, especially in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor low-rank representation methods lack adaptability to noise and use fixed transformations, which limits their capacity to capture global and local correlations effectively.

Method: The proposed TBTLRR model introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm (using unitary transforms) and integrates bilateral tensor structure. Additionally, regularization terms ($\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm) are included to handle complex noise. An optimization algorithm based on ADMM is developed for solving the model.

Result: Experimental results show that TBTLRR outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods, demonstrating its robustness to noise and superior capabilities.

Conclusion: TBTLRR successfully enhances image clustering, adapting to data characteristics while handling noise effectively. The approach proves effective via theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a system to standardize endoscopic videos while addressing privacy concerns and usability issues for widespread adoption in surgical training and research.

Method: The application was developed following an iterative, user-centered software development lifecycle, with surveys identifying usability requirements and privacy-focused architecture.

Result: Clinicians and computer scientists rated the prototype highly for usability. Further surveys showed strong user recommendation and usability, with variances in processing time based on mode, video duration, and computational power.

Conclusion: Endoshare ensures privacy-preserving video standardization with high usability and user acceptance. Validation and certification are needed before broader deployment as an alternative to proprietary solutions.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies key principles of self-attention (SA) mechanisms and introduces Attentive Convolution (ATConv), which incorporates these principles in convolutional operations to achieve superior performance in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between traditional convolutions (Conv) and self-attention (SA) mechanisms while retaining the efficiency and visual priors of Conv.

Method: The authors identify two key principles driving the superior performance of SA—adaptive routing and lateral inhibition—and integrate these principles into a new convolutional operator, Attentive Convolution (ATConv).

Result: ATConv outperforms standard SA mechanisms in vision tasks, achieving 84.4% ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. Additionally, using ATConv in diffusion models improves ImageNet FID scores and accelerates sampling.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that incorporating SA principles into convolutional methods closes the performance gap while retaining efficiency, presenting ATConv as a promising breakthrough in vision tasks.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Motivation: Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, generating abstract human-drawn sketches remains challenging due to difficulties in capturing their abstract and expressive nature.

Method: The authors propose StableSketcher which fine-tunes the variational autoencoder for better latent decoding and uses a reinforcement learning reward function based on visual question answering to enhance text-image alignment and semantic consistency.

Result: StableSketcher demonstrates improved stylistic fidelity and superior alignment with text prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline. Additionally, the new SketchDUO dataset provides instance-level sketches paired with captions and Q&A pairs.

Conclusion: StableSketcher provides a significant step forward in generating human-drawn sketches with higher prompt alignment and stylistic fidelity, alongside offering the SketchDUO dataset to address existing dataset limitations.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

### [119] [BIOCAP: Exploiting Synthetic Captions Beyond Labels in Biological Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20095)
*Ziheng Zhang,Xinyue Ma,Arpita Chowdhury,Elizabeth G. Campolongo,Matthew J. Thompson,Net Zhang,Samuel Stevens,Hilmar Lapp,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of descriptive captions as supervision for biological multimodal models and proposes a method to generate accurate synthetic captions for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment and performance of biological multimodal models by leveraging descriptive captions as a source of supervision, addressing challenges in generating accurate instance-specific captions at scale.

Method: The authors propose generating synthetic captions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and domain-specific formatting to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy. They introduce BIOCAP, a foundation model trained with these captions.

Result: BIOCAP demonstrates strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, indicating the effectiveness of incorporating descriptive captions during training.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions enhance the alignment of biological images with multimodal foundation models and are valuable beyond traditional label-based supervision, bridging the gap in biological multimodal learning.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

### [121] [Inverse Image-Based Rendering for Light Field Generation from Single Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20132)
*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to generate light fields from single images using inverse image-based rendering, enabling realistic rendering and view synthesis without requiring specialized devices or computationally expensive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for light field generation rely on computationally expensive processes or specialized hardware, making them less accessible and flexible.

Method: The authors propose an inverse image-based rendering method that uses a neural rendering pipeline to compute relationships between rays from a single input image to generate novel views iteratively.

Result: The method demonstrates its effectiveness across challenging datasets, consistently generating realistic novel views from single images and surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach broadens the applicability of light field generation, enabling realistic rendering with less resource dependence, and showcases strong generalization across datasets without needing retraining.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

*Jiachen Liang,Ruibing Hou,Minyang Hu,Hong Chang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LogitGap, a post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method that enhances separability between in-distribution and OOD samples by exploiting the logit relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of deep learning models in open-world settings by enhancing OOD detection through better utilization of logit space information.

Method: The authors propose LogitGap, which utilizes the gap between the maximum logit and other logits. They refine it by identifying a compact subset of informative logits through a training-free method.

Result: LogitGap achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection, validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on vision-language and vision-only models.

Conclusion: The LogitGap method offers an effective and efficient approach for OOD detection and significantly improves reliability in open-world model applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

TL;DR: PartNeXt is a 3D dataset with over 23,000 high-quality textured models and detailed annotations, addressing limitations of the older PartNet dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance object understanding in 3D environments, overcoming scalability and usability issues of existing datasets relying on untextured models and expert annotation.

Method: The researchers created PartNeXt, a dataset of 23,000+ textured 3D models annotated with hierarchical part labels across 50 categories, benchmarking it on segmentation and question answering tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art methods struggled with fine-grained tasks on PartNeXt, highlighting gaps in current 3D part understanding and improving Point-SAM training with significant gains.

Conclusion: PartNeXt improves 3D object understanding with its high-quality annotations and scalability, offering opportunities for advancements in computer vision, robotics, and related fields.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

### [124] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an 8D pose estimation method for bicycles and cyclists that improves upon 6D pose methods by incorporating steering and pedal angles for better travel direction prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclist safety in autonomous driving relies on precise pose estimation for predicting crossing intention, behavior, and avoiding collisions. Existing methods lack the ability to account for the articulation of bicycles.

Method: The authors propose an 8D pose estimation model that estimates steering and pedal rotations in addition to 3D rotation and translation, using a combination of synthetic and real image data.

Result: The method achieves competitive accuracy in estimating fine-grained poses and travel directions compared to current 6D pose techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates promising results, offering advancements in articulated bicycle pose estimation and improving its applicability in real-world scenarios for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) by proposing a method to update multimodal prototypes and adapt to distribution shifts to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for CZSL face performance issues due to test-time distribution shifts caused by unseen attribute-object compositions.

Method: The approach involves updating multimodal prototypes using unsupervised textual and visual data, incorporating adaptive weighting for adjustments, utilizing a dynamic priority queue for inference, and aligning multimodal knowledge through collaborative learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets for both closed-world and open-world CZSL tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles distribution shifts in CZSL, showcasing improved recognition capabilities for unseen compositions.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

TL;DR: The paper introduces IB-GAN, an unsupervised GAN-based model for disentangled representation learning using the Information Bottleneck framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disentangled representation learning in generative models by applying the Information Bottleneck framework to GAN optimization.

Method: IB-GAN utilizes an intermediate stochastic layer in the generator to constrain mutual information between input and output and jointly trains the generator with this layer for optimized representation learning.

Result: IB-GAN shows competitive disentanglement scores compared to state-of-the-art β-VAEs, outperforms InfoGAN, and demonstrates better visual quality and diversity for generated samples, based on FID scores in multiple datasets.

Conclusion: IB-GAN leverages the Information Bottleneck framework effectively, offering improvements in disentanglement, sample quality, and diversity compared to leading models like InfoGAN and β-VAEs.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPMStereo, a method for temporally consistent depth estimation in stereo video using a memory buffer to optimize spatio-temporal information aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally inconsistent depth estimation disrupts user immersion in augmented reality applications, making it crucial to achieve accurate, computationally efficient temporal consistency.

Method: PPMStereo employs a Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module with a two-stage process: a 'pick' step selects relevant frames, and a 'play' step adaptively weights them for refined spatio-temporal aggregation.

Result: PPMStereo demonstrated improved accuracy and temporal consistency with fewer computational costs, achieving superior TEPE scores on the Sintel benchmark compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PPMStereo method effectively balances temporal modeling and computational efficiency, offering promising applications in real-world scenarios requiring consistent depth estimation from stereo video.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of text-to-video and image-to-video models in simulating realistic pedestrian dynamics and interactions, which are crucial for advancements in general-purpose simulation systems.

Method: The researchers used an evaluation protocol employing ground truth video data for image-to-video models and a diverse prompt suite for text-to-video models. An innovative method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space was applied.

Result: Leading video generation models demonstrate effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior, but exhibit issues like merging and disappearing individuals.

Conclusion: The study highlights that while video generation models have potential for simulating multi-agent dynamics, further advancements are needed to address observed failure modes and improve their reliability.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPAN, a network for assessing temporal suspicious intentions in video surveillance, shifting from discrete classification to continuous regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve security monitoring by better capturing and explaining fluctuating suspicious intentions.

Method: SPAN leverages continuous regression and a suspicion score formula with temporal dependencies; incorporates multimodal information and intention concept mapping.

Result: SPAN improves performance significantly on HAI dataset, reducing MSE by 19.8% and enhancing mAP by 1.78%, especially in low-frequency cases.

Conclusion: SPAN facilitates early detection, proactive intervention, and enhances explainability of suspicious behaviors in video surveillance systems.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: The study analyzes 54 publicly available brain MRI datasets to understand variability and its implications for developing foundation models, emphasizing preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic assessment of variability, scale, diversity, and consistency in publicly accessible brain MRI datasets, which are crucial for developing foundation models.

Method: The study analyzes dataset-level features, image-level variability, and preprocessing effects. It uses statistical evaluations and conducts a case study using a 3D DenseNet121 model to assess residual covariate shift and bias.

Result: Strong imbalances between dataset scales and clinical populations were observed. Substantial heterogeneity in voxel-level features exists. Preprocessing improves consistency but leaves residual differences, confirmed by the case study that identifies measurable covariate shift after preprocessing.

Conclusion: Variability in dataset properties and preprocessing effects highlights the need for preprocessing-aware methods and domain-adaptive strategies in designing generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++ introduces a multi-step framework to optimize prompts for text-to-video generation models, improving video quality without modifying the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of short, unstructured, and misaligned user prompts, which restrict diffusion-based T2V models' generative capabilities.

Method: RAPO++ implements a three-stage process: Stage 1 enriches prompts with training-aligned data, Stage 2 iteratively refines prompts with feedback mechanisms, and Stage 3 fine-tunes prompts using large language models for enhanced pre-inference quality.

Result: Significant improvements in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility across five T2V models and benchmarks were achieved.

Conclusion: RAPO++ sets a new benchmark for prompt optimization in text-to-video generation through its scalable, cost-efficient, and model-agnostic approach, improving quality without altering base models.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowCycle, a novel framework for text-based image editing, which improves upon existing methods by creating a target-aware intermediate state using learnable noises and cycle-consistent processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image editing methods struggle with editability and consistency when desired modifications significantly deviate from the source image due to their target-agnostic intermediate state.

Method: FlowCycle employs a learning-based corruption parameterized by noises and optimizes them through cycle consistency, ensuring selective content modification while maintaining original attributes.

Result: FlowCycle demonstrates better editing quality and source consistency compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, as evidenced by extensive ablations.

Conclusion: FlowCycle enables more faithful and consistent image modifications by generating target-aware intermediate states, addressing key limitations in current text-based image editing strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework called CURL for detecting fetal movement from ultrasound videos, achieving high sensitivity and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve fetal movement detection, which is crucial for prenatal health assessment, by overcoming limitations in traditional methods such as maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG).

Method: The researchers developed CURL, a self-supervised learning approach using dual-contrastive loss for spatial and temporal contrast and specialized sampling strategies to differentiate motion and non-motion segments.

Result: The proposed CURL framework demonstrated a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60% on a dataset of 92 subjects with extended ultrasound recordings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that CURL effectively improves fetal movement detection, showing promise for better prenatal monitoring and enhanced clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

*Jiahuan Wang,Yuxin Chen,Jun Yu,Guangming Lu,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EditInfinity, a VQ-based generative model for effective text-driven image editing that addresses limitations of diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based generative models for image editing face performance issues caused by errors during image inversion due to lack of exact intermediate supervision.

Method: The authors developed EditInfinity using VQ-based generative models for image editing. They introduced precise image inversion techniques and a holistic smoothing strategy to improve fidelity and semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark demonstrate that EditInfinity outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based models in 'add', 'change', and 'delete' editing tasks.

Conclusion: The EditInfinity model effectively mitigates the approximation errors in image inversion and achieves high-quality text-driven image editing.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [135] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in long responses and introduces a framework to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underlying causes of hallucination in long responses produced by LVLMs, and to mitigate these hallucinations effectively while better understanding the role of context.

Method: The researchers propose an "induce-detect-suppress" framework that induces hallucinations with deliberately created contexts, detects high-risk instances early, and suppresses object-level hallucinations during response generation.

Result: The novel framework achieves consistent and significant improvements in mitigating hallucinations, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed approach across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hallucinations in LVLMs' long responses are not solely influenced by length, but by their increased dependence on context for coherence. The framework validates this idea and aids in reducing hallucination issues, offering new understanding and pathways for further exploring hallucination challenges.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Result: SELM-SLAM3 outperformed ORB-SLAM3 by 87.84% on average and exceeded state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77% across multiple challenging datasets.

Conclusion: SELM-SLAM3 enhances SLAM performance under difficult conditions and offers a promising platform for navigation systems tailored to the needs of visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust

87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework
demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

TL;DR: COS3D introduces a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework for effective integration of language and segmentation cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the mutual understanding and performance of open-vocabulary 3D segmentation by addressing weaknesses in existing methods.

Method: Propose a collaborative field consisting of an instance field and a language field. Utilize instance-to-language feature mapping and a two-stage training strategy for constructing the field. Refine prompts during inference using adaptive language-to-instance techniques.

Result: COS3D outperforms current methods on two popular benchmarks and shows strong applicability to novel 3D segmentation areas, including robotics.

Conclusion: The COS3D framework integrates complementary cues for better segmentation and language interaction, demonstrating improved performance and expanded application possibilities.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the shortcomings of existing embodied AI agents, including latency-performance trade-offs, inauthentic evaluation metrics, and a gap between model design and agent needs, while advancing Artificial General Intelligence.

Method: EmbodiedBrain uses an agent-aligned data structure, integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Step-Augmented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a Generative Reward Model (GRM), and a robust evaluation system with real-time challenges.

Result: Experimental testing confirms superior performance across all proposed benchmarks, establishing EmbodiedBrain as a state-of-the-art model for embodied foundation tasks.

Conclusion: EmbodiedBrain presents a significant step forward in creating robust and efficient embodied agents. All associated data, model weights, and evaluation methods are open-sourced, fostering progress in the AGI field.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,

*Minseok Kang,Minhyeok Lee,Minjung Kim,Donghyeong Kim,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualGround, a dual-branch architecture for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), addressing limitations in current methods due to uniform treatment of text tokens during crossmodal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTG methods overly rely on global semantics (e.g., [EOS]) while failing in fine-grained temporal alignment, necessitating a structured approach to utilize word-level signals.

Method: DualGround explicitly separates global and local semantics by routing global semantics ([EOS] token) through sentence-level path and grouping word tokens into phrase units for localized grounding, coupled with token role-aware crossmodal interaction strategies and a joint modeling framework.

Result: DualGround outperforms existing methods in Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangled semantic modeling enhances video-language alignment, allowing better coarse and localized semantics understanding for VTG.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALICE-LRI, a method for creating lossless range images from spinning LiDAR sensors, preserving all data and supporting high-precision applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR processing methods lose data due to projection-induced geometric inconsistencies, which limits the accuracy in high-fidelity applications.

Method: The authors develop ALICE-LRI, a sensor-independent algorithm that reverse-engineers intrinsic parameters of spinning LiDAR sensors, enabling lossless range image projection.

Result: ALICE-LRI achieves zero point loss in reconstructed point clouds, maintains geometric accuracy within sensor limits, and performs in real-time across the KITTI and DurLAR datasets.

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI enables lossless data preservation, enhances accuracy, and improves downstream applications, revolutionizing LiDAR processing for precision-demanding remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDGeo, a novel framework using mask-based positional encoding and context enhancement module to improve cross-view object geo-localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-view object geo-localization relies on keypoint-based positional encoding which captures only 2D coordinates and neglects crucial object shape information, resulting in limited matching capability and sensitivity to annotation shifts.

Method: The study proposes a mask-based positional encoding scheme (MPE) to incorporate spatial and object silhouette information, and a context enhancement module (CEM) using horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to improve feature discrimination for large-span objects.

Result: EDGeo demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in localization accuracy, showing a 3.39% improvement in challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios on public datasets like CVOGL and VIGOR-Building.

Conclusion: EDGeo provides a robust framework for cross-view object geo-localization research, upgrading models to become "object-aware" while addressing challenges posed by large-span objects with better contextual modeling.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC) model to enhance Multimodal Emotion Recognition by addressing semantic inconsistencies across modalities and reducing text dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to multimodal emotion recognition face challenges with semantic inconsistencies across modalities and over-reliance on text modality.

Method: CMC leverages a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) for unimodal pretraining and uses a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) along with a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning.

Result: CMC demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models on CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI datasets, excelling particularly in cases of semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: CMC addresses key challenges in multimodal emotion recognition by ensuring balanced fusion across modalities, improving recognition accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMFVAD, a novel method for video anomaly detection, utilizing multi-modal features to enhance detection performance by reducing redundant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video anomaly detection methods overlook redundancy in visual features when incorporating text-based multi-modal information.

Method: GMFVAD refines visual features using grained multi-modal data derived from video content and text captions, emphasizing highlighted portions of the video.

Result: GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, with experiments showing its improvements stem from reduced redundancy.

Conclusion: The use of grained multi-modal features improves video anomaly detection accuracy by addressing redundancy issues, proving effective performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCR methods often achieve high prediction accuracy but fail to address inherent dataset biases in textual and visual data, necessitating strategies to enhance model robustness.

Method: The authors present the VCR-OOD datasets for evaluating model generalization and utilize causal graph analysis alongside backdoor adjustment. They design a dictionary of correct answers to mitigate prediction biases.

Result: The proposed debiasing methods are experimentally demonstrated to improve model performance over various datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of addressing bias in VCR tasks and provides a novel dataset and approach for enhancing generalization and fairness in multi-modal reasoning models.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

*Haodong Yang,Zhongling Huang,Shaojie Guo,Zhe Zhang,Gong Cheng,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers introduced the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN) for complex-valued SAR image recognition, addressing challenges in generalization, interpretability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the trilemma in CV-SAR image recognition: balancing generalization, interpretability, and efficiency under data-limited and domain-shift conditions. It is inspired by the unused potential of electromagnetic scattering features in SAR data.

Method: The KINN framework uses a unique 'compression-aggregation-compression' architecture. It starts with physics-guided compression for embedding physical priors, then enriches the representation with an aggregation module, and finishes with a semantic compression stage for task-relevant embeddings. The model is deployed in CNN and Vision Transformer variants.

Result: KINN shows state-of-the-art performance in parameter-efficient recognition, with strong generalization for data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios. It was validated on five SAR benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging physical priors through KINN resolves the representation trilemma and promotes trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

*Jiayi Zou,Chaofan Chen,Bing-Kun Bao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework to improve Egocentric Video Question Answering by addressing unique challenges from the first-person perspective and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the unique challenges in Egocentric Video Question Answering, particularly in dealing with the complexities of multiple events and hand-object interactions specific to first-person video content.

Method: The proposed method integrates a counterfactual contrastive approach that includes constructing counterfactual samples for both textual and visual modalities and employing a contrastive optimization to optimize the relationships between original, positive, and negative samples.

Result: The DMC$^3$ framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 52.51% and 46.04% on normal and indirect splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D benchmarks.

Conclusion: The introduced DMC$^3$ framework effectively tackles the unique issues of Egocentric VideoQA and improves its performance significantly through the use of counterfactual sample construction and contrastive optimization.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel paradigm, Instruction-as-Reasoning, for GUI grounding, demonstrating substantial performance improvements through a two-stage training framework and achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve GUI grounding by addressing flaws (23.3% flaw rate) in natural-language instructions and exploring diversity and quality to enhance grounding performance.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for multi-perspective reasoning using diverse synthesized instructions, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing pathway composition.

Result: The models UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on five benchmarks and demonstrate emergent reasoning capabilities for novel instruction pathways.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves grounding accuracy and mitigates policy collapse in training while enhancing reasoning formulation for more effective GUI interaction.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of severe inter-platform heterogeneity and domain gaps in cross-modal drone navigation tasks, allowing for accurate retrieval of geo-referenced images via natural-language queries.

Method: Authors employed a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline for partitioning, augmentation, and caption refinement via LLMs. They used BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), training three platform experts with hard-negative mining and fused their scores at inference.

Result: Their solution topped the official leaderboard, showing robust cross-modal geo-localization and handling heterogeneous viewpoints effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve cross-modal geo-localization in drone navigation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite
augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

### [152] [HyperET: Efficient Training in Hyperbolic Space for Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20322)
*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often face inefficiencies due to weak cross-modal alignment in vision encoders. HyperET leverages hyperbolic space to address this, improving MLLMs' visual-textual alignment efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs require massive computational resources because their vision encoders lack effective multi-granularity alignment with language, creating inefficiency.

Method: The paper presents HyperET, which uses hyperbolic space and dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment to optimize visual-to-textual representation alignment at arbitrary levels of granularity.

Result: HyperET improves performance in pre-training and fine-tuning of MLLMs while adding less than 1% additional parameters, verified through comprehensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: HyperET effectively addresses granularity gaps between visual and textual modalities using hyperbolic space, achieving enhanced alignment efficiently and with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose AnyPcc, a novel framework to improve generalization in point cloud compression by introducing a universal context model and an instance-adaptive fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generalization in point cloud geometry compression caused by the lack of robust context models and inefficient handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

Method: The approach, AnyPcc, employs a Universal Context Model for robust dependencies and introduces Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) to handle OOD data by fine-tuning specific network weights and efficiently encoding them.

Result: Extensive experiments validate AnyPcc's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art results across 15 diverse benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AnyPcc successfully overcomes key challenges of point cloud compression, offering robust generalization and efficient handling of OOD data. The release of code and datasets promotes further reproducible research in this domain.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AccuQuant introduces a novel post-training quantization for diffusion models, addressing error accumulation over denoising steps for improved sampling results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle quantization error accumulation in diffusion models during sampling, which affects output quality.

Method: AccuQuant minimizes discrepancies between full-precision and quantized diffusion models over multiple denoising steps, with an efficient memory-saving implementation reducing complexity from O(n) to O(1).

Result: AccuQuant shows superior performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and benchmarks for diffusion models.

Conclusion: AccuQuant substantially improves quantization methods by addressing error accumulation effectively, resulting in enhanced accuracy and efficiency in diffusion model applications.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for image generation, introducing a new method, PE-Field, to extend positional encodings to structured 3D for improved spatial coherence and editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial coherence and enable advanced features like volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encoding in image generation using DiTs.

Method: The authors introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings to a structured 3D field for volumetric and fine-grained sub-patch control.

Result: Their PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art results in single-image novel view synthesis and controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: Extending positional encodings to 3D space significantly enhances Diffusion Transformers' ability to model geometry and improves their performance in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

### [156] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in existing image-to-recipe retrieval approaches by introducing a causal representation learning method to enhance capturing subtle culinary elements not apparent in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to link food images with recipes effectively due to an over-reliance on visual features that ignore non-visible details such as ingredients and cooking processes.

Method: A novel causal approach is proposed that predicts unseen culinary elements from images and integrates these into cross-modal representation learning to reduce biases between images and recipes.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance on both monolingual (Recipe1M) and multilingual multicultural cuisine datasets, enhancing the retrieval of recipes with subtle differences.

Conclusion: Causal representation learning successfully bridges the modality gap between food images and recipes by accounting for overlooked culinary details, improving performance in diverse datasets.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet, which uses dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation for improved lung cancer image classification, achieving high accuracy on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the complexity and uncertainty in lung cancer diagnosis by improving classification performance while optimizing computational efficiency.

Method: Utilizes dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation (KD) where weights are adjusted dynamically, Vision Transformer as the instructor model, MobileNet as the student model, and genetic algorithm for student model selection; employs pixel-level image improvement and fusion techniques.

Result: Achieved high accuracy: 99.16% on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images, demonstrating improved classification and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles uncertainty in lung cancer diagnosis while maintaining computational efficiency and achieving high accuracy across domains.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

*Kun Ouyang,Yuanxin Liu,Linli Yao,Yishuo Cai,Hao Zhou,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng,Xu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Conan, a framework for improving multi-step video reasoning through evidence grounding, combining a new dataset and training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with multi-step reasoning in videos due to reliance on text-based methods or inaccurate frame retrieval.

Method: The authors developed Conan-91K, a dataset with reasoning traces, and an AIR RLVR training framework that combines Identification, Reasoning, and Action stages.

Result: Conan achieves state-of-the-art performance with over 10% accuracy improvement compared to baseline models on six reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Conan demonstrates strong scalability, accuracy, and robustness in both short and long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

### [159] [Reliable and Reproducible Demographic Inference for Fairness in Face Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20482)
*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reproducible and modular pipeline for demographic attribute inference (DAI), which is crucial for fairness auditing in face analysis systems. The method demonstrates high accuracy, fairness, and robustness, with a focus on ethnicity inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of demographic attribute inference in fairness auditing, as current systems hinge on DAI's reliability.

Method: A modular transfer learning pipeline using pretrained face recognition encoders and non-linear classification heads, validated with the robustness metric, accuracy, and fairness.

Result: The method surpasses strong baselines, particularly on challenging attributes like ethnicity, ensuring better estimates for fairness evaluations.

Conclusion: The pipeline serves as a reliable foundation for demographic inference, promoting data transparency and reproducibility essential for fairness auditing in face analysis systems.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on

### [160] [EchoDistill: Bidirectional Concept Distillation for One-Step Diffusion Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20512)
*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill is introduced as a novel bidirectional concept distillation framework aimed at enabling one-step diffusion personalization in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-step text-to-image (T2I) models, despite being fast, struggle to integrate novel concepts effectively due to their limited capacity to learn new distributions.

Method: EchoDistill employs simultaneous training of a multi-step teacher model and a one-step student model using shared text encoders, adversarial losses, alignment losses, and a bidirectional echoing refinement strategy.

Result: Experiments show that EchoDistill significantly outperforms current methods in one-step diffusion personalization setups, enhancing both personalization capability and generative quality.

Conclusion: EchoDistill introduces a new approach for personalization in T2I models, benefiting both single-step generation efficiency and collaborative model improvement.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

*Xiaohan Lan,Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu,Siqi Yang,Delian Ruan,Peng Shi,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Metis-HOME, a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework, to tackle inefficiency and generalization issues in multimodal large reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models have inefficiencies in handling simple queries and suffer from reduced general capabilities due to a narrow focus on specialized reasoning.

Method: The authors propose Metis-HOME, which separates the reasoning model into two experts: one for complex reasoning and another for general rapid inference. A lightweight router dynamically assigns tasks to appropriate experts.

Result: Metis-HOME improves both complex reasoning and general capabilities, contrasting with other reasoning-specialized models that degrade general understanding.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME resolves reasoning vs generalization trade-offs, setting a new standard for creating powerful and versatile multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework introduces advancements in Explainable DeepFake Analysis via fine-grained data annotation and a novel Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Explainable DeepFake Analysis methods lack fine-grained awareness in artifact description, connections between visual evidence and textual explanations, and support for queries on arbitrary facial regions.

Method: The FiFa framework introduces a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) for precise data annotation, develops the FiFa-Annotator, and proposes the AGE task within a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM.

Result: FiFa-MLLM outperforms strong baselines in the Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA) datasets.

Conclusion: The FiFa framework advances the reliability and precision of DeepFake analysis by bridging textual explanations and visual evidence through fine-grained techniques.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

*Guillermo Carbajal,Andrés Almansa,Pablo Musé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a deep learning method to jointly estimate sharp images and camera motion trajectories from a single blurry image, utilizing a Projective Motion Blur Model for state-of-the-art restoration results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in image restoration caused by severe motion blur due to camera shake, particularly from large or rotational movements.

Method: Utilizes a deep learning framework with the Projective Motion Blur Model and modular architecture to estimate 3D rotation trajectories for sharp image recovery, followed by trajectory optimization using reblur loss.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in deblurring tasks, outperforming end-to-end networks, particularly for challenging cases of severe or spatially variant blur.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers interpretable results and high-quality restoration, extending its utility for synthetic and real datasets with severe motion blur.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACamera-Net is a lightweight network designed to improve image quality under challenging lighting conditions by predicting optimal exposure and white balance directly from RAW inputs. It significantly enhances imaging performance compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer-grade cameras often struggle with image quality in complex lighting conditions, causing degraded image output and downstream vision task performance.

Method: ACamera-Net includes two modules: ACamera-Exposure for estimating ISO to address underexposure and ACamera-Color for optimizing color temperature and gain for consistency. The system is designed for real-time edge device compatibility.

Result: ACamera-Net demonstrated superior performance in enhancing image quality and stabilizing perception outputs, outperforming auto modes and baseline methods in diverse lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed ACamera-Net offers an effective solution for mitigating common image quality issues in challenging lighting environments, proving to be versatile, efficient, and well-suited for integration in imaging pipelines.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

*Jiahao Meng,Xiangtai Li,Haochen Wang,Yue Tan,Tao Zhang,Lingdong Kong,Yunhai Tong,Anran Wang,Zhiyang Teng,Yujing Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Most models for reasoning over videos focus on textual traces only without localizing evidence in temporal and spatial dimensions. Open-o3 Video integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, providing grounded reasoning with timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video reasoning often lacks explicit localization of key evidence across dynamic scenes, making it difficult to ensure accuracy and credibility. This paper seeks to address this gap by integrating spatio-temporal evidence into reasoning models.

Method: The study introduces Open-o3 Video, using two newly curated datasets with spatio-temporal annotations (STGR-CoT-30k and STGR-RL-36k) and applies a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multi-dimensional rewards for accuracy, temporal, and spatial precision.

Result: Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art results in the V-STAR benchmark, improving mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% compared to the baseline, with consistent improvements across multiple video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video enhances video reasoning by explicitly grounding visual evidence in space and time. Its reasoning traces improve accuracy, reliability, and confidence-aware verification during scaling tests.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

*Muhammad Atif Butt,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Tao Wu,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Joost Van De Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenColorBench, a benchmark for evaluating precise color generation in text-to-image models, addressing the current lack of systematic assessment for color controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with precise color generation and matching text prompts accurately, while existing benchmarks fail to systematically evaluate color-specific capabilities.

Method: The authors propose GenColorBench, a benchmark grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, featuring 44K color-specific prompts and evaluations based on perceptual and automated methods.

Result: Evaluation of popular text-to-image models reveals their varying capabilities in understanding color conventions and highlights their areas of failure.

Conclusion: GenColorBench provides the first comprehensive framework for evaluating and guiding improvements in color precision for text-to-image generation systems, with its public release forthcoming.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for cross-modality segmentation focused on learning class-wise prototypes and leveraging dictionaries, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models face performance issues when encountering unseen data due to domain shift, necessitating methods for unsupervised domain adaptation to reduce domain gaps.

Method: The framework involves learning class-wise prototypes in embedding space, using similarity constraints for better representation, and employing dictionaries for prototype extraction and contrastive learning.

Result: Through extensive experimentation, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in segmentation, showcasing improved and robust performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents OnlineSplatter, an efficient framework for reconstructing free-moving objects from monocular videos without pose or depth priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in reconstructing objects from monocular video due to arbitrary motion and lack of reliable pose or depth cues.

Method: OnlineSplatter utilizes RGB frames and a dual-key memory module to progressively refine 3D Gaussian representations of objects with constant computational cost, starting with the first frame.

Result: OnlineSplatter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in pose-free reconstruction, improving with more observations while maintaining fixed memory and runtime.

Conclusion: The framework achieves high-quality reconstruction of free-moving objects using a novel approach, addressing challenges in monocular video setups.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework, SeViCES, to enhance long video understanding by selecting informative frames through semantic and visual consensus, improving the performance and reliability of Video-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video analysis is computationally intensive while often producing unfocused results. Current methods lack temporal dependency integration and rely mainly on unimodal evidence, limiting the context provided by selected frames.

Method: The proposed SeViCES framework uses two components: a Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module for context-aware selection based on semantic reasoning and clustering mutual information, and an Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) module for reconciling semantic and visual predictions.

Result: Experiments show SeViCES outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness on long video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Consensus-driven evidence selection improves accuracy and consistency in Video-LLMs for long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dental image analysis faces challenges like low contrast, artifacts, variations in angles, and interpretation subjectivity, hindering accurate diagnosis and consistent outcomes.

Method: The study systematically reviews 260 research papers, categorizes DL models and datasets, analyzes their methods, and discusses metrics, challenges, and future directions.

Result: The paper identifies trends in deep learning adoption for dental image analysis, summarizes existing datasets, and evaluates various DL-based techniques while highlighting their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Deep learning plays a critical role in automated dental image analysis and holds potential for advancing computer-aided diagnoses and treatments by addressing existing challenges.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D improves 3D medical imaging applications by introducing a causal convolutional encoder-decoder with enhanced tokenization methods, outperforming existing models in report generation and text-to-3D image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language modeling techniques for 3D medical imaging struggle with high-resolution volumes and clinical language alignment, leading to reduced diagnostic performance.

Method: BTB3D introduces a causal convolutional encoder-decoder with a three-stage training curriculum for better volumetric tokenization and long-context processing in 3D imaging.

Result: BTB3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving BLEU scores and clinical F1 by 40% for report generation, while reducing FID by 75% and halving FVD for text-to-CT synthesis.

Conclusion: Precise 3D tokenization is key for scalable vision-language modeling in medical imaging; BTB3D demonstrates significant advancements over previous approaches.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses two major challenges in ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image generation: the lack of a large-scale dataset and the need for tailored training strategies, by introducing a high-quality dataset (UltraHR-100K) and innovative training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in UHR text-to-image generation demand addressing challenges, including the absence of large-scale datasets and effective training methods to generate fine-grained details.

Method: The methods include introducing UltraHR-100K, a 100K high-quality dataset for UHR scenarios, and proposing a frequency-aware post-training method using Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) and Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR) to preserve fine details.

Result: Through experiments conducted on the UltraHR-eval4K benchmark, the study demonstrates significant improvements in fine-grained detail generation and overall fidelity in UHR text-to-image models.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations, including UltraHR-100K dataset and tailored training methods, present effective solutions to enhance the quality and detail in UHR text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning framework for waste classification, achieving 97.39% accuracy with energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of waste misclassification that lead to environmental impacts like landfill accumulation and inefficient recycling.

Method: Proposes HybridSOMSpikeNet, a framework using ResNet-152 for feature extraction, Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map for clustering, and spiking neural network for temporal processing.

Result: Achieved 97.39% test accuracy on a ten-class waste dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art architectures and maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HybridSOMSpikeNet supports precise automated waste segregation, improving recycling efficiency, reducing contamination, and contributing to global sustainability goals, especially SDG 11 and SDG 12.

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

### [175] [Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20673)
*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces techniques to optimize training for multi-bit quantization networks, achieving similar or better accuracy with up to 7.88x reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-bit quantization models suffer from substantial training overhead due to repeated updates for different bit-widths and require extra fine-tuning stages.

Method: The paper proposed weight bias correction for aligning activation distributions across bit-widths and a bit-wise coreset sampling strategy for training child models on compact, gradient-informed subsets.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K using ResNet and ViT architectures demonstrated competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively reduce training overhead and maintain high model accuracy, providing efficient solutions for multi-bit quantization networks.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Motivation: MLLMs struggle with visual hallucinations and over-reliance on textual priors, impacting their ability to effectively handle complex visual tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses memory bottlenecks in large vision-language models (LVLMs) due to key-value (KV) cache expansion by introducing MixKV, a method that balances diversity and importance for better KV cache compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to solve the memory bottleneck issue in LVLMs created by the expansion of KV caches, enabling better scalability and deployment.

Method: The paper proposes MixKV, a method that combines importance and diversity to adaptively compress KV caches in LVLMs while addressing semantic redundancy patterns across attention heads.

Result: MixKV improves baseline methods by 5.1% on average across five benchmarks under extreme compression and achieves notable gains on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MixKV provides an effective solution for KV cache compression in LVLMs, improving performance and scalability while achieving notable gains in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoScape, a new framework for creating geometrically consistent, long-horizon driving scene videos using novel RGB-D diffusion and video generation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating long-horizon, geometrically consistent driving video scenes, and improve the fidelity and coherence of these videos.

Method: AutoScape uses a novel RGB-D diffusion model for generating consistent keyframes by incorporating image-depth fusion, conditioning on prior scene geometry, and warp-consistent guidance. A video diffusion model interpolates high-quality RGB-D keyframes into coherent videos.

Result: AutoScape produces realistic driving videos of over 20 seconds and achieves a 48.6% and 43.0% improvement in long-horizon FID and FVD scores over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AutoScape demonstrates significant advancements in the generation of long-horizon driving scenes with enhanced geometric consistency and realism, pushing the boundaries of video synthesis.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

*Noam Issachar,Guy Yariv,Sagie Benaim,Yossi Adi,Dani Lischinski,Raanan Fattal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE), enabling pre-trained diffusion transformers to generate high-resolution images far beyond training data without extra sampling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion transformers at ultra-high resolutions is computationally expensive due to quadratic scaling of the self-attention mechanism.

Method: The proposed method, DyPE, dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step to align with the frequency spectrum of the generative process.

Result: The approach allows generation of images at resolutions significantly exceeding the training resolution, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Conclusion: DyPE is a training-free, efficient technique that enhances the capabilities of diffusion transformers for ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, demonstrating superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves on the MeanFlow framework by identifying and addressing optimization conflicts and introducing $\alpha$-Flow, achieving state-of-the-art generative modeling results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the optimization conflict and slow convergence inherent in the MeanFlow framework for few-step generative modeling.

Method: The authors propose $\alpha$-Flow, a unified framework that incorporates a curriculum strategy to smoothly transition between trajectory flow matching and MeanFlow.

Result: The $\alpha$-Flow model outperforms MeanFlow in convergence and state-of-the-art results, achieving FID scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE) on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: $\alpha$-Flow resolves the conflicts within MeanFlow and improves convergence and performance, making it an effective generative modeling approach.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

TL;DR: Cupid, a novel 3D reconstruction method, uses conditional sampling to generate 3D shape, texture, and camera pose from a single 2D image, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance 3D reconstruction methods by integrating camera pose estimation, 3D shape, and texture generation into a unified framework.

Method: Cupid employs a two-stage flow matching pipeline with coarse and refinement stages to generate 3D geometry and enhance detail using pixel-voxel correspondences.

Result: Experiments show Cupid achieves over 3 dB PSNR gain, a 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, improved pose accuracy, and better visual fidelity compared to leading methods.

Conclusion: Cupid provides a robust generative approach for accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D images, delivering superior performance and visual quality compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

TL;DR: The paper introduces a radar-camera fusion framework for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), using online calibration and common feature integration to improve tracking precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MOT systems underutilize radar's ability to provide accurate range/depth information. The paper aims to enhance tracking by fully utilizing radar in combination with camera data while reducing manual interventions.

Method: The framework performs online sensor calibration to associate radar and camera detections, incorporates common features to determine objects' positions, and employs feature matching and category-consistency checking to improve accuracy.

Result: The framework streamlines the radar-camera integration process and demonstrates improved tracking precision in both controlled environments and real-world traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed radar-camera fusion MOT framework effectively enhances tracking accuracy, reduces manual efforts, and provides significant advancements in sensor integration methodologies.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: ARGenSeg proposes a novel framework for integrating image segmentation within multimodal large language models using autoregressive generation to produce dense and accurate masks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal image segmentation typically rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limit the ability to capture fine-grained visual details.

Method: ARGenSeg introduces a novel segmentation framework for MLLM based on autoregressive image generation, leveraging visual tokens from MLLM and transforming them into images via VQ-VAE. A next-scale-prediction strategy reduces latency during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARGenSeg outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation datasets, achieving better accuracy and faster inference.

Conclusion: ARGenSeg demonstrates a robust, efficient, and unified approach to multimodal image segmentation with improved pixel-level perception and operational speed.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Motivation: To improve existing video-generative approaches by focusing on the causal modeling of physical simulations and leveraging transformer-based methods.

Method: The authors introduce a simple transformer model for video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations and investigating different spatiotemporal self-attention layouts.

Result: Their approach extends the time horizon for physically accurate video predictions by up to 50%, maintains comparable video quality metrics, and provides insights into parameter estimation via interpretability experiments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of attention-based spatiotemporal modeling through a straightforward and efficient transformer-driven method, offering both effective performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models face challenges with dense layouts that require precise localization and multi-hop reasoning to address textual and graphical interconnections.

Method: SV combines small VLMs (draft experts) generating reasoning paths with a large VLM (verdict model) synthesizing these paths. A consensus mechanism filters high-agreement paths for efficient processing.

Result: SV achieves consistent improvements in accuracy and efficiency on visual question answering benchmarks such as InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.

Conclusion: SV offers a training-free, cost-efficient approach that leverages speculative decoding, error correction, and consensus to improve multimodal reasoning models. Open-source code is provided for public access.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph, a self-supervised hyperspectral-multispectral fusion framework, enhances hyperspectral image resolution while ensuring interpretability and robustness, even with minimal bands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral sensors have low spatial resolution, leading to limitations like blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel issues. The fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral imaging aims to address these limitations by leveraging the spatial detail of multispectral sensors.

Method: SpectraMorph employs a physics-guided, self-supervised approach with a structured latent space. Instead of direct regression, it uses an unmixing bottleneck to extract endmember signatures and predict abundance-like maps. Spectra are reconstructed through linear mixing, guided by the MSI sensor's spectral response function.

Result: SpectraMorph shows faster training time (under a minute), strong interpretability, and robustness even with single-band (panchromatic) MSI. It outperforms current unsupervised/self-supervised baselines and competes strongly with supervised methods.

Conclusion: SpectraMorph provides an efficient, interpretable, and robust solution for hyperspectral super-resolution without supervision, applicable to various datasets and conditions.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LDDBM, a novel framework utilizing diffusion models for translating information across different sensory modalities without restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extending diffusion models to modality translation tasks, overcoming current limitations like reliance on restrictive assumptions.

Method: The paper presents the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), which operates in a shared latent space. It includes contrastive alignment loss, noise prediction mechanisms, domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture, and predictive loss to improve cross-domain translation.

Result: LDDBM demonstrates strong performance across diverse modality translation tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.

Conclusion: Comprehensive experiments establish LDDBM as an effective framework and a baseline for general modality translation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer enhances personalized text-to-image generation with interactive, multi-subject design using layered canvas and flexible locking mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with spatial composition and handling multiple subjects while maintaining interactive control.

Method: LayerComposer introduces a layered canvas for occlusion-free composition and a locking mechanism using positional embeddings and a novel data sampling strategy.

Result: Experiments verify LayerComposer's superiority in spatial control and preserving subject identities compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: LayerComposer provides an intuitive framework for precise multi-subject artistic control without architectural modifications, advancing interactive text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

### [190] [HoloCine: Holistic Generation of Cinematic Multi-Shot Long Video Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20822)
*Yihao Meng,Hao Ouyang,Yue Yu,Qiuyu Wang,Wen Wang,Ka Leong Cheng,Hanlin Wang,Yixuan Li,Cheng Chen,Yanhong Zeng,Yujun Shen,Huamin Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine introduces a generative model for creating coherent, multi-shot cinematic scenes rather than isolated video clips, advancing automated filmmaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models excel in generating individual clips but lack the ability to produce coherent storytelling across multiple shots, which is essential for narratives.

Method: HoloCine utilizes a Window Cross-Attention mechanism for aligning text with specific shots and employs Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention for efficient and consistent multi-shot generation.

Result: HoloCine improves narrative coherence, supports persistent memory of characters and scenes, and demonstrates cinematic techniques. It sets state-of-the-art performance for storytelling videos.

Conclusion: The work transitions from clip synthesis to automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation feasible with enhanced narrative capability and directorial precision.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

### [191] [New Hardness Results for the LOCAL Model via a Simple Self-Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19972)
*Alkida Balliu,Filippo Casagrande,Francesco d'Amore,Dennis Olivetti*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper simplifies the round elimination via self-reduction technique and applies it to derive new lower bounds for MAXIMAL b-MATCHING and EDGE COLORING problems in randomized distributed algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify the complex proof of the round elimination via self-reduction technique by Khoury and Schild and make it more digestible. Simplifications often lead to a better understanding, which can further aid in solving related graph problems.

Method: The authors present a simplified version of Khoury and Schild's round elimination via self-reduction technique, then utilize this improved approach to derive new lower bounds on specific graph problems like maximal b-matching and edge coloring.

Result: They achieve new hardness results in distributed algorithms for (1) the maximal b-matching problem, detailing specific lower bounds for randomized LOCAL algorithms, and (2) edge coloring problems, also providing lower bound results for these.

Conclusion: This work not only simplifies the intricate proof of Khoury and Schild but also generalizes their approach to establish new lower bounds for additional problems. It marks a significant step towards better understanding the complexity of distributed graph problems.

Abstract: Very recently, Khoury and Schild [FOCS 2025] showed that any randomized LOCAL
algorithm that solves maximal matching requires $\Omega(\min\{\log \Delta,
\log_\Delta n\})$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree. This result is shown through a new technique,
called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful
and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical
details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems.
Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an
important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph
problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides
the following contributions.
  1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via
self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to
obtain the following two hardness results.
  2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal
$b$-matching problem requires $\Omega(\min\{\log_{1+b}\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$
and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching
problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have
up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain
a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild.
  3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors
the edges of a graph with $\Delta + k$ colors requires $\Omega(\min\{\log
\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\le
\Delta^{1-\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\varepsilon > 0$.

### [192] [AsyncHZP: Hierarchical ZeRO Parallelism with Asynchronous Scheduling for Scalable LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20111)
*Huawei Bai,Yifan Huang,Wenqi Shi,Ansheng You,Feifan Shao,Tengfei Han,Minghui Yu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Asynchronous Hierarchical Zero Parallelism (AsyncHZP), a new method for efficiently training large models by reducing communication overhead and improving memory utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in the training of large language models, especially the communication overhead and lack of scalability in current approaches like ND parallelism and ZeRO.

Method: The proposed method, AsyncHZP, adapts parameter, gradient, and optimizer state reshards adaptive across groups and uses a novel multi-stream asynchronous scheduling for overlapping communication and computation.

Result: AsyncHZP shows superior performance in empirical evaluations, demonstrating better scalability and less complexity compared to ND parallelism and ZeRO while achieving state-of-the-art efficiency.

Conclusion: AsyncHZP simplifies the process of training large-scale models, enhancing performance and memory efficiency while reducing communication overhead, thus improving scalability and practicality for large clusters.

Abstract: The training efficiency and scalability of language models on massive
clusters currently remain a critical bottleneck. Mainstream approaches like ND
parallelism are often cumbersome and complex, while flexible alternatives such
as the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) are frequently hampered by
communication overhead. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Hierarchical
Zero Parallelism (AsyncHZP), a novel asynchronous variant of ZeRO designed to
achieve superior performance while maintaining simplicity and memory
efficiency. Unlike traditional ZeRO, which employs over-fine-grained sharding
that can lead to inefficient communication, AsyncHZP adaptively reshards
parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across different replica groups.
This strategy optimizes device memory utilization and significantly reduces
communication overhead. In addition, we also design a multi-stream asynchronous
scheduling method that executes parameter all-gather and gradient
reduce-scatter operations in dedicated background threads, effectively
overlapping communication with computation while incurring negligible memory
fragmentation. Empirical evaluations on both Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models confirm that AsyncHZP maintains robust stability at scale. It
consistently outperforms classic ND parallelism, achieving state-of-the-art
performance without complex strategic tuning, thereby simplifying the path to
efficient large-scale training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an HPC-QC full stack framework for integrating scalable High-Performance Computing with Quantum Computing using modular approaches, targeting device-agnostic operation and hybrid workload development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the increasing demand for integrated HPC and QC systems by creating a scalable and unified framework to leverage both computational paradigms efficiently.

Method: The framework offers a modular interface blending quantum programming and classical HPC compilation. It uses an adaptive circuit knitting hypervisor to partition quantum circuits and employs LLVM-based compilation for versatile hardware targeting.

Result: The framework demonstrated hybrid HPC-QC workloads, such as solving linear systems, optimization tasks, and quantum simulations, on HPE EX supercomputers successfully.

Conclusion: This framework facilitates unified quantum-classical programming environments, advancing scalable integration of classical HPC and quantum computational systems with extensive configurability.

Abstract: To address the growing needs for scalable High Performance Computing (HPC)
and Quantum Computing (QC) integration, we present our HPC-QC full stack
framework and its hybrid workload development capability with modular
hardware/device-agnostic software integration approach. The latest development
in extensible interfaces for quantum programming, dispatching, and compilation
within existing mature HPC programming environment are demonstrated. Our HPC-QC
full stack enables high-level, portable invocation of quantum kernels from
commercial quantum SDKs within HPC meta-program in compiled languages (C/C++
and Fortran) as well as Python through a quantum programming interface library
extension. An adaptive circuit knitting hypervisor is being developed to
partition large quantum circuits into sub-circuits that fit on smaller noisy
quantum devices and classical simulators. At the lower-level, we leverage Cray
LLVM-based compilation framework to transform and consume LLVM IR and Quantum
IR (QIR) from commercial quantum software frontends in a retargetable fashion
to different hardware architectures. Several hybrid HPC-QC multi-node multi-CPU
and GPU workloads (including solving linear system of equations, quantum
optimization, and simulating quantum phase transitions) have been demonstrated
on HPE EX supercomputers to illustrate functionality and execution viability
for all three components developed so far. This work provides the framework for
a unified quantum-classical programming environment built upon classical HPC
software stack (compilers, libraries, parallel runtime and process scheduling).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current communication frameworks struggle to handle LLM workloads involving hundreds of thousands of GPUs due to limitations in throughput and latency.

Method: The authors developed the NCCLX framework tailored for handling complex workloads by focusing on high-throughput and low-latency communication requirements during training and inference.

Result: Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model shows significant improvements in communication efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: The NCCLX framework provides a scalable and robust communication solution, enabling the operation and development of next-generation LLMs at unprecedented scales.

Abstract: The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) necessitates highly
efficient collective communication frameworks, particularly as training
workloads extend to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Traditional communication
methods face significant throughput and latency limitations at this scale,
hindering both the development and deployment of state-of-the-art models. This
paper presents the NCCLX collective communication framework, developed at Meta,
engineered to optimize performance across the full LLM lifecycle, from the
synchronous demands of large-scale training to the low-latency requirements of
inference. The framework is designed to support complex workloads on clusters
exceeding 100,000 GPUs, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency
data exchange. Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model demonstrates
substantial improvements in communication efficiency. This research contributes
a robust solution for enabling the next generation of LLMs to operate at
unprecedented scales.

*Víctor Rampérez,Javier Soriano,David Lizcano,Juan A. Lara*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FLAS introduces an advanced auto-scaling system for distributed services, combining predictive and reactive mechanisms to ensure performance compliance with SLAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud computing requires efficient auto-scaling solutions to maintain elasticity and meet service-level agreements.

Method: FLAS combines predictive modeling of high-level metrics and reactive contingency mechanisms to optimize scaling actions for distributed services.

Result: FLAS implementation on content-based publish-subscribe middleware demonstrated over 99% compliance with performance requirements in rigorous test cases.

Conclusion: FLAS is a robust, adaptable auto-scaling solution for distributed services, validated through extensive testing scenarios.

Abstract: Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority
of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it
offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring
and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this
article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for
distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive
approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in
every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model
of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the
relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or
throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of
high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary
instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to
different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a
content-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone
of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed
systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through
an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected
contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the
Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our
approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring
compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a methodology to accurately predict application performance in dynamic edge environments with up to 90% accuracy and minimal latency, improving resource utilization and predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to tackle the challenge of achieving predictable application performance in resource-constrained, dynamic edge environments with node heterogeneity and application co-location.

Method: The proposed methodology automatically builds and evaluates performance predictors using historical monitoring metrics, optimizing for accuracy and inference latency.

Result: The predictors achieved up to 90% accuracy with inference time being under 1% of the Round Trip Time in dynamic co-location scenarios across multiple servers.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a systematic methodology for selecting server-specific predictors can significantly enhance performance predictability and resource utilization in edge environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of application performance is critical for enabling
effective scheduling and resource management in resource-constrained dynamic
edge environments. However, achieving predictable performance in such
environments remains challenging due to the co-location of multiple
applications and the node heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a
methodology that automatically builds and assesses various performance
predictors. This approach prioritizes both accuracy and inference time to
identify the most efficient model. Our predictors achieve up to 90% accuracy
while maintaining an inference time of less than 1% of the Round Trip Time.
These predictors are trained on the historical state of the most correlated
monitoring metrics to application performance and evaluated across multiple
servers in dynamic co-location scenarios. As usecase we consider electron
microscopy (EM) workflows, which have stringent real-time demands and diverse
resource requirements. Our findings emphasize the need for a systematic
methodology that selects server-specific predictors by jointly optimizing
accuracy and inference latency in dynamic co-location scenarios. Integrating
such predictors into edge environments can improve resource utilization and
result in predictable performance.

*Panagiotis Giannakopoulos,Bart van Knippenberg,Kishor Chandra Joshi,Nicola Calabretta,George Exarchakos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Round-Trip Time (RTT) predictors to optimize request routing, achieving up to 95% accuracy and reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional load-balancing methods are reactive and rely on outdated metrics, leading to inefficiencies and higher latencies in distributed applications.

Method: The authors developed lightweight RTT predictors trained on time-series monitoring data from Kubernetes-managed GPU clusters, using highly correlated metrics to reduce overhead and improve adaptability.

Result: The predictors achieved 95% accuracy with prediction delays within 10% of application RTT, showcasing that performance-aware load balancing reduces latency and resource waste.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of predictive load balancing, offering pathways to optimize latency and resource management in future production systems.

Abstract: Distributed applications increasingly demand low end-to-end latency,
especially in edge and cloud environments where co-located workloads contend
for limited resources. Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically
reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to
suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper
investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request
routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and
accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data
collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of
highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while
remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous
hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the
prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify
the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required
to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters.
Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing
can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These
results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into
future production systems.

### [198] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures solely rely on self-attention layers for retrieval tasks, with attention ablation resulting in retrieval failure. Self-attention appears to specialize for these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the functional roles of self-attention and SSM layers in hybrid architectures and challenge assumptions about redundancy and integration in these systems.

Method: The authors tested how attention ablation and sparsification impact performance on retrieval and MMLU tasks. They analyzed mechanisms required for retrieval and evaluated specialization in hybrid architectures.

Result: Ablating self-attention layers caused catastrophic retrieval failure, but sparsifying attention to minimal heads still maintained performance. SSM layers lacked compensatory retrieval mechanisms.

Conclusion: Hybrid architectures exhibit strict functional specialization rather than redundancy or integration, which invites reevaluation of architecture optimization and interpretability.

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAS-DQN, combining neural architecture search with deep reinforcement learning dynamically, and proves its superiority over static designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of fixed neural network architectures in deep reinforcement learning by exploring adaptive designs that dynamically optimize during training.

Method: NAS-DQN applies a neural architecture search controller within the reinforcement learning training loop to adapt the architecture based on cumulative performance feedback.

Result: Experimental comparisons revealed that NAS-DQN outperformed fixed architecture baselines and random searches in terms of final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Dynamic architecture adaptation is essential for optimal efficiency in reinforcement learning and should be integrated into training processes rather than relying on static pre-training designs.

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGraphT, a retrieval-augmented approach, enables small language models (SLMs) to achieve near-large language model (LLM) performance in CUDA optimization while ensuring privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines is challenging, and while LLMs show potential in CUDA optimization, they pose privacy and computational challenges. This necessitates more efficient and private solutions, like SLMs, but they underperform in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Method: A training-free, retrieval-augmented generation framework called ReGraphT leverages reasoning graphs and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) to transfer LLM-level reasoning capabilities to SLMs.

Result: ReGraphT surpasses high-performance computing-specific fine-tuned models and other approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on benchmarks and closing the performance gap between SLMs and LLMs.

Conclusion: ReGraphT represents an effective, privacy-conscious, and computationally efficient solution for CUDA code optimization by small language models, making them practical for real-world use while achieving near-LLM performance.

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

*Haozhe Shan,Sun Minni,Lea Duncker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel two-system approach for continual learning and compositional task-solving in RNN models, leading to effective transfer and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the neural mechanisms underpinning continual learning and reusable skill composition in intelligent behavior remains unclear, motivating this study to explore it using RNNs and cognitive tasks.

Method: The authors develop a two-system approach, where one system ("what") uses a probabilistic generative model for task composition, and the other ("how") uses RNNs with low-rank components shaped by inferred contexts. An unsupervised online learning method is executed for sequential tasks.

Result: The framework demonstrates competitive performance, forward/backward task transfer, and generalization to new tasks using an example task set, while successfully minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: This innovative two-system model efficiently handles continual learning and compositional reuse in RNNs, providing deeper insights into neural mechanisms for intelligent, adaptive behavior.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

*Mostafa Ameli,Van Anh Le,Sulthana Shams,Alexander Skabardonis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Transformer-based model for faster and scalable prediction of equilibrium path flows in traffic networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic assignment methods under the Equilibrium principle struggle with computational inefficiency for large-scale networks due to the non-linear complexity of OD pairs.

Method: The authors propose leveraging deep neural networks, specifically Transformer architecture, to directly predict equilibrium path flows and capture detailed correlations between OD pairs.

Result: Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate drastic reductions in computation time, improved prediction accuracy, and adaptability to varying conditions.

Conclusion: The Transformer-based approach enables rapid traffic flow estimation and supports dynamic traffic management and policy-making through efficient and flexible computations.

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

*Shiqi Dai,Wei Dai,Jiaee Cheong,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FairGRPO, a hierarchical reinforcement learning method enhancing fairness across clinical populations in AI medical diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance disparities in AI medical diagnostics across demographic groups, often causing harm to underrepresented populations due to biased datasets.

Method: Introduced Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), using adaptive weighting and unsupervised clustering to equitably optimize performance across diverse clinical populations.

Result: FairGRPO reduced predictive parity by 27.2%, improved F1 score by 12.49%, and demonstrated improved fairness dynamics compared to baseline methods in clinical applications.

Conclusion: FairGRPO enhances fairness and diagnostic performance in medical AI models, addressing demographic bias issues; it enables future development of fairness-aware clinical systems, like FairMedGemma-4B.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a SHAP-based feature selection approach to improve diagnosis of urinary tract diseases, focusing on bladder cancer, through predictive models using classifiers like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases, particularly bladder cancer, using transparent and effective predictive models.

Method: Develop SHAP-based feature selection to enhance classification models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), with hyperparameter tuning via Optuna, and SMOTE for class balancing.

Result: The proposed methodology uses explainability techniques successfully to enhance predictive models' metrics, including balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity.

Conclusion: The SHAP-based approach improves clinical support systems by making them more reliable, transparent, and efficient for diagnosing urinary tract diseases, aiding early detection efforts.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

*Trajan Murphy,Akshunna S. Dogra,Hanfeng Gu,Caleb Meredith,Mark Kon,Julio Enrique Castrillion-Candas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FINDER, a novel framework for classification in noisy datasets using stochastic analysis and Hilbert spaces, validated in fields like Alzheimer's classification and deforestation detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in classification arise for noisy datasets, which often have low signal-to-noise ratios, small samples, or faulty data collection.

Method: FINDER uses stochastic features derived from random fields mapped into Hilbert spaces, leveraging the KLE expansion to isolate data features for classification.

Result: The framework demonstrated breakthroughs in challenging datasets, such as Alzheimer’s disease stage classification and deforestation detection.

Conclusion: FINDER shows promise for handling noisy classification problems by addressing randomness in datasets with limitations and conditions under which it may not perform optimally.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [206] [Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19933)
*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Muon optimizer, focusing on its practical inexact orthogonalization mechanism instead of idealized theoretical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in theory and practice regarding the efficiency of Muon optimizer, as previous studies considered idealized, computationally impractical scenarios.

Method: The analysis introduces an additive error model within the LMO-based optimization framework to evaluate the impact of approximation in Muon's updates.

Result: Explicit bounds were derived to quantify performance degradation caused by inexact orthogonalization. It identifies the relationship between approximation precision and learning parameters such as step size and momentum.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that precision of the approximation procedure and learning parameters must be co-optimized for effective performance, confirmed through NanoGPT experiments.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new $f$-differential privacy (DP) accounting methods tailored to decentralized Federated Learning (FL), providing more accurate privacy quantification and improved utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately quantifying the privacy budget in decentralized Federated Learning systems due to their complex components, such as decentralized communication and local updates.

Method: The authors proposed two $f$-DP-based accounting methods: (1) Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), focusing on user-pair privacy leakage under random-walk communication, and (2) Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), introducing structured noise injection via shared secrets.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed methods achieve tighter $(\epsilon, \delta)$ privacy bounds and provide superior utility compared to existing Renyi DP-based approaches.

Conclusion: The use of $f$-DP-based accounting methods enhances decentralized FL privacy accounting by capturing the nuances of sparse communications, local iterations, and correlated noise, demonstrating both tighter privacy guarantees and improved utility.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates task orderings in continual learning for linear regression, focusing on greedy strategies for maximizing dissimilarity between tasks, yielding faster convergence in certain cases compared to random orderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore optimal task orderings in continual learning, particularly addressing gaps in understanding surrounding greedy dissimilarity-based strategies.

Method: Using tools from the Kaczmarz method, the study formalizes greedy task orderings and analyzes them through geometric and algebraic approaches. It evaluates both random and greedy strategies analytically and empirically in regression and classification tasks.

Result: Greedy orderings are shown to converge faster than random ones in some scenarios. Loss bounds were established: random orderings achieve $O(1/sqrt{k})$, while greedy orderings allowing repetition achieve $O(1/sqrt[3]{k})$. Single-pass greedy orderings may lead to catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: Greedy orderings perform well under certain configurations, but nuances exist in their effectiveness compared to random strategies. The study enhances understanding of task orderings for continual learning and provides analytical bounds on their convergence.

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the mismatch between RL training on historical data and real-life deployments in financial markets with market impact. It introduces novel elliptic uncertainty sets for robust RL to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve RL agents' performance in live markets where their actions affect asset prices, contrasting the training on historical data without market impact.

Method: The paper introduces elliptic uncertainty sets and derives closed-form solutions for worst-case uncertainty evaluation, ensuring efficient robust policy assessment.

Result: The method improves the Sharpe ratio in trading tasks, demonstrating robustness to increased trade volumes in both single-asset and multi-asset experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed elliptic uncertainty sets provide a scalable and realistic approach for RL in financial markets, addressing the asymmetric nature of market impact and enhancing robustness.

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive differential privacy method to improve performance in decentralized learning using variance-reduced gradients and adjustable noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed-variance noise strategies in differential privacy degrade model performance and training efficiency in decentralized learning.

Method: Introduced ADP-VRSGP, a decentralized learning method with adaptive differential privacy that adjusts noise variance and learning rates with a progressive gradient fusion strategy.

Result: ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence, improved model performance, and faster training stability across multiple experimental scenarios.

Conclusion: The method enhances privacy-preserving decentralized learning while addressing noise-induced limitations effectively.

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes unbiased gradient estimators within the zeroth-order optimization framework to resolve bias issues while preserving favorable variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order optimization methods suffer from bias in gradient estimators unless perturbation stepsize approaches zero.

Method: The authors introduce unbiased gradient estimators by reformulating directional derivatives using telescoping series and sampling from optimized distributions, and analyze their theoretical properties.

Result: The proposed method achieves optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives and demonstrates superior accuracy and convergence in experiments, including language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This work alleviates the bias issue in current zeroth-order optimization while ensuring efficiency and accuracy, marking an enhancement in stochastic optimization techniques.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of effective bidding strategies in online advertising, utilizing a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) model with delayed Poisson rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance automated bidding strategies in online advertising by addressing delayed and long-term effects, cumulative impacts, and customer heterogeneity, which are not commonly tackled jointly in prior studies.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator combined with a data-splitting approach for effective estimation, and develop a reinforcement learning algorithm for personalized bidding strategies.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$ under theoretical analysis, validated by simulation experiments.

Conclusion: This study provides an efficient and theoretically validated approach for personalized ad bidding, addressing key challenges in online advertising platforms to maximize advertiser profits.

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) for two-point zeroth-order gradient estimation, showing its advantages over traditional fixed-length perturbation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current zeroth-order gradient estimation methods, which mostly rely on fixed-length perturbations and overlook the potential benefits of directional alignment with the true gradient.

Method: The authors introduce DAP, a novel perturbation scheme that aligns directionally with the true gradient, and analyze its theoretical properties. They also extend complexity bounds for stochastic gradient descent using random perturbations.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic and practical tasks demonstrate that DAPs achieve better performance compared to traditional fixed-length perturbation approaches under specific conditions.

Conclusion: Directionally aligned perturbations can improve gradient estimation accuracy and performance, paving the way for more effective zeroth-order optimization techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UCAN is a novel technique for enhancing adversarial robustness in machine learning using anisotropic noise distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods for certified adversarial robustness employ isotropic noise distributions that are ineffective in considering input heterogeneity and data dimensional nuances.

Method: UCAN converts existing randomized smoothing methods that apply isotropic noise into those utilizing anisotropic noise distributions, supported by a theoretical framework and optimal noise parameter generators (NPGs).

Result: UCAN demonstrates significant performance improvements, with up to 182.6% enhancement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on various datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet.

Conclusion: UCAN provides a more effective and versatile approach to achieve adversarial robustness by optimizing noise distributions to align with input characteristics.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

### [215] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the shortcomings of selective classifiers compared to ideal oracle behavior, analyzes five error sources in the selective-classification gap, and proposes actionable solutions to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selective classifiers aim to increase model reliability by abstaining on uncertain predictions, but they often fail to reach ideal performance levels characterized by perfect prediction ordering.

Method: The authors introduce a finite-sample decomposition of the selective-classification gap into five distinct error sources: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and slack due to implementation or data shift.

Result: Controlled experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal the contributions of each error source, with richer, feature-aware calibrators improving score rankings, while data shift demands robust training strategies.

Conclusion: The paper provides a quantitative error framework and design guidelines to help practitioners enhance selective classifiers, moving them closer to optimal oracle-like behavior.

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: Time series prediction accuracy can improve by truncating historical data due to eliminating redundant features. Authors propose AMRC to optimize deep learning forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting models struggle due to redundant features in long historical sequences which compromise signal extraction and prediction accuracy.

Method: Authors propose Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), including dynamic masking loss for discriminative temporal segment identification and representation consistency constraint for stabilizing mappings in forecasting models.

Result: Experiments show AMRC suppresses redundant feature learning while significantly enhancing performance for deep learning-based time series forecasting.

Conclusion: AMRC refines forecasting models by addressing shortcomings in existing methods, offering theoretical insights and practical improvements to temporal modeling.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: The paper investigates Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), addressing their performance and proposing methods to enhance reasoning and decoding. Innovations include reasoning-as-infilling and multi-token entropy decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether the additional compute used by MDLMs for masked positions is justifiable, given their performance in math and coding tasks is comparable or worse than left-to-right token decoding.

Method: The authors propose reasoning-as-infilling for structured output generation and distinguishing reasoning tokens from answers. They also introduce multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a sampling method minimizing errors using conditional entropies.

Result: Using reasoning-as-infilling to fine-tune MDLMs on their posterior reasoning traces matches performance achieved by human reasoning trace fine-tuning. MED significantly reduces decoding steps while preserving benchmark performance.

Conclusion: MDLMs, despite their compute expense, unlock innovative inference methods like reasoning templates and adaptive sampling, demonstrating new potentials for improvement and efficient post-training methods.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

### [218] [Machine Learning-Based Localization Accuracy of RFID Sensor Networks via RSSI Decision Trees and CAD Modeling for Defense Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20019)
*Curtis Lee Shull,Merrick Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the application of supervised learning on RFID data to classify the location of defense assets within lab zones and addresses challenges related to imbalanced data and misclassification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve RFID tracking for defense assets to enhance security and reduce risks of erroneous detection, spoofing, and counterfeiting.

Method: The study uses a supervised learning simulation incorporating RSSI data and Decision Tree classification, applied to a CAD-modeled floor plan with class imbalance adjustments.

Result: The model achieved an accuracy of 34.2% with F1-scores exceeding 0.40 for several zones, though rare classes were often misclassified.

Conclusion: The results show that RSSI-based Decision Tree models can help in zone-level anomaly detection in defense logistics, but improvements are needed in low-signal zones through optimized antenna placement or sensor fusion.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

### [219] [SALT: Step-level Advantage Assignment for Long-horizon Agents via Trajectory Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20022)
*Jiazheng Li,Yawei Wang,David Yan,Yijun Tian,Zhichao Xu,Huan Song,Panpan Xu,Lin Lee Cheong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALT, a framework improving multi-step tasks in group-based RL algorithms by refining advantage assignment using a graph-based approach, validated across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in applying LLMs to long-horizon, multi-step tasks affected by training instability and suboptimal policies in group-based RL algorithms.

Method: SALT uses graph-based advantage assignment derived from trajectory outcome rewards to evaluate step quality and integrates seamlessly with group-based RL algorithms, enhancing advantage assignment.

Result: Experiments on WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks across different LLM sizes show SALT consistently boosts performance.

Conclusion: The SALT framework improves group-based RL algorithms for complex tasks, offering insights and verifying its effectiveness through thorough experimentation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides an ML-compatible graph reconstructing Bitcoin's economic topology and flow of funds, enabling machine learning research using comprehensive Bitcoin data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Bitcoin network offers significant data potential for ML research; however, its pseudonymity and UTXO-based design obscure the flow of funds.

Method: The authors reconstructed the flow of funds as a temporal, heterogeneous graph encompassing the complete Bitcoin transaction history, providing tools for sampling, analysis, and database snapshots.

Result: The dataset includes over 2.4 billion nodes and 39.72 billion edges, along with features for sampled communities and analysis within specialized graph databases.

Conclusion: The dataset and tools empower the ML community to explore Bitcoin's ecosystem at scale, addressing challenges such as anomaly detection and large-scale graph ML benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market
analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking. Dataset and code available at

### [221] [Speculative Sampling for Parametric Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20031)
*Marin Biloš,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rejection sampling-based algorithm that enables efficient parallel sampling of temporal point processes (TPPs), avoiding the limitations of sequential sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling in temporal point processes is inherently sequential, causing efficiency bottlenecks in large-scale applications.

Method: The authors propose a rejection sampling algorithm that allows exact and parallel sampling of multiple future events from existing TPP models without modifying the model architecture or requiring retraining.

Result: The proposed method offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical speedups when tested on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines expressive TPP modeling with efficient parallel generation, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

*Hongyi Liu,Jiaji Huang,Zhen Jia,Youngsuk Park,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for online draft model selection in speculative decoding for large language models, improving upon existing methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance speculative decoding by addressing online draft model selection issues, optimizing performance with a better draft model evaluation method.

Method: The authors propose a novel algorithm that evaluates all draft models without additional queries to the target model, increasing efficiency exponentially as the number of draft models grows. This solution is applicable across various speculative decoding methods and is optimized for computational efficiency.

Result: Through extensive experimentation on open-source large language models and diverse datasets, the proposed methods outperform current baselines like EAGLE3 and BanditSpec, particularly in tasks requiring specialized domain-expert drafters or complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The study provides a significant improvement in speculative decoding processes, both in terms of performance and efficiency, demonstrating its superiority in a variety of domains and use cases.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

*Yimeng Qiu,Feihuang Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates if liquidity and volatility proxies of key cryptoassets predict market-wide risk using statistical analyses, machine learning techniques, and empirical data from 2021 to 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether liquidity and volatility proxies of cryptoassets can provide insights into forecasting market-wide risk.

Method: The study applies three statistical layers combining principal-component analysis, autoregression methods, machine learning protocols, and Granger-causal relationships using extensive cryptoasset data.

Result: Significant causal relationships are identified across layers with moderate predictive accuracy validated by statistical techniques and machine learning analyses.

Conclusion: Liquidity and volatility measures of core cryptoassets significantly contribute to forecasting market risks, supported by robust statistical and machine learning frameworks.

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

### [224] [Coupled Transformer Autoencoder for Disentangling Multi-Region Neural Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20068)
*Ram Dyuthi Sristi,Sowmya Manojna Narasimha,Jingya Huang,Alice Despatin,Simon Musall,Vikash Gilja,Gal Mishne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE), a novel approach for analyzing neural activity data from multiple brain regions, effectively separating shared and region-specific dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing complex neural dynamics across multiple brain regions, which involve shared and region-specific structures as well as non-stationary dynamics, and overcome the limitations of existing methods.

Method: The authors propose the Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE), which uses transformer encoders and decoders to model long-range temporal neural dynamics while separating shared and private latent spaces specific to various brain regions.

Result: CTAE was tested on two high-density electrophysiology datasets from motor and sensory regions, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful representations and outperform existing methods in decoding behavioral variables.

Conclusion: The proposed CTAE provides a robust framework to study both shared and region-specific neural dynamics, showcasing better performance for decoding tasks, and thus holds promise for advancing neural activity analysis across brain regions.

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeX introduces a novel approach for explaining time series classification by focusing on shapelets—key subsequences critical for classification outcomes—rather than timestep-level attributions, achieving improved explanations with causal fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for explaining time series classification models in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance, ensuring transparency and trust, and addressing the limitation of existing methods that overlook shapelets.

Method: ShapeX leverages the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework to segment time series into shapelet-driven segments and uses Shapley values to evaluate their saliency for explanations.

Result: ShapeX surpasses existing methods in identifying relevant subsequences, improving explanation precision and causal fidelity in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ShapeX enhances the interpretability of time series classification with a focus on shapelets, providing causal insights and better explanations, making it valuable for critical applications.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

### [226] [Hierarchical Dual-Head Model for Suicide Risk Assessment via MentalRoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20085)
*Chang Yang,Ziyi Wang,Wangfeng Tan,Zhiting Tan,Changrui Ji,Zhiming Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network model for suicide risk classification on social media posts addressing challenges like class imbalance and temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms serve as crucial sources for identifying suicide risks, which require improved automated detection methods due to challenges such as class imbalance and complexity in posting behaviors.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical dual-head neural network using MentalRoBERTa for classifying suicide risk into four levels. It incorporates CORAL and standard classification heads for both ordinal and categorical tasks, a 3-layer Transformer encoder for temporal analysis, and time interval embeddings. A combined loss function balances ordinal relationships and reduces class imbalance.

Result: The model underwent 5-fold stratified cross-validation and performance was evaluated using macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Conclusion: Efforts in this study improve suicide risk classification by leveraging advanced neural network techniques, addressing key challenges like class imbalance and temporal dynamics efficiently.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

*Amartya Roy,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal discovery that bridges the gap between empirical performance and finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal discovery either excel in empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, or offer theoretical rigor but fail to scale. This paper aims to unify these strengths.

Method: The proposed approach involves using a DDQN agent competing against established methods like GES or GraN-DAG while warm-starting from their solutions. It provides provable guarantees in terms of convergence and accuracy.

Result: The new framework reduces error probability with increasing sample size, improves performance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and scales to large graphs.

Conclusion: This work introduces a scalable RL-based causal discovery algorithm that offers strong empirical performance alongside rigorous theoretical guarantees, marking progress in the field of causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dimension-based weighting schema integrated with the KNN classifier to improve classification accuracy, especially for high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address issues in traditional distance measures like Euclidean distance in pattern classification, particularly for multi-dimensional and high-dimensional data.

Method: The authors analyze distance measures and propose a new dimension-weighting scheme, incorporating it into the KNN classifier. They tested it on synthetic and real datasets, using weighted Minkowski distance.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional KNN, improving classification accuracy by around 10% on gene expression datasets across various experiments.

Conclusion: The developed model demonstrates the importance of weighted dimension-based distance in pattern classification, particularly enhancing KNN's performance for complex, high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

### [229] [Why Prototypes Collapse: Diagnosing and Preventing Partial Collapse in Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20108)
*Gabriel Y. Arteaga,Marius Aasan,Rwiddhi Chakraborty,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Thalles Silva,Michael Kampffmeyer,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses the issue of partial prototype collapse in prototypical self-supervised learning methods by introducing a fully decoupled training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial prototype collapse reduces the diversity and information of targets necessary for guiding encoders toward learning rich representations, prompting the need for an effective approach beyond regularization or over-parameterization.

Method: The authors propose decoupling prototype learning and encoder optimization by modeling prototypes as a Gaussian mixture that undergoes an online EM-style update, separate from the encoder's loss function.

Result: The method eliminates prototype collapse without requiring additional explicit regularization and results in consistently diverse prototypes and improved downstream performance.

Conclusion: Decoupling the training of prototypes from encoder optimization provides a more robust and simple solution to prototype collapse, enhancing self-supervised learning outcomes through diverse and informative representations.

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

### [230] [There is No "apple" in Timeseries: Rethinking TSFM through the Lens of Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20119)
*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a gap between timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) and their supervised or classical counterparts due to the inappropriate adaptation of methodologies from NLP and CV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ineffectiveness of directly importing NLP and CV methodologies for timeseries data due to inherent differences in data representation and availability.

Method: The authors suggest focusing on principled dataset design to span the invariances that preserve the temporal semantics of timeseries data, instead of relying on opportunistic, web-scale data aggregation.

Result: They argue that creating a proper ontology of timeseries invariances can help align TS representations for better generalization, reasoning, and emergent behaviors.

Conclusion: To advance TSFMs, the paper concludes that a systematic design of datasets capturing temporal invariance is crucial, rather than relying on the methodologies of NLP/CV. This is key for achieving meaningful timeseries model improvement.

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how structural and functional connectivity interact to influence tau protein spread in Alzheimer’s disease using a graph diffusion model, revealing distinct patterns and shifts in dominance over disease progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how pathological tau proteins propagate within brain networks, contributing to Alzheimer’s disease progression, and the role of structural and functional connectivity in this process.

Method: A multi-layer graph diffusion model is employed to analyze longitudinal neuroimaging data, focusing on SC-FC interactions and their contribution to tau spread in different brain regions.

Result: The model demonstrates specific dominance patterns of SC and FC across brain regions in early and late stages of Alzheimer's disease, with alignment to AD-associated gene expression and influences of risk factors like APOE genotype and amyloid deposition.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the interplay between SC and FC in tau pathology progression, influenced by genetic and biological factors, offering insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

### [232] [Empowering Targeted Neighborhood Search via Hyper Tour for Large-Scale TSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20169)
*Tongkai Lu,Shuai Ma,Chongyang Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method tailored for large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) to improve solution efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural-based methods for solving TSP face scalability issues, especially in handling large instances due to memory constraints and insufficient global guidance.

Method: The HyperNS method utilizes a strategy of 'clustering first, route second,' dividing TSPs into clusters using a sparse heatmap graph, abstracting them as supernodes, and generating a hyper tour for guiding initialization and optimization processes.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed that HyperNS significantly outperforms existing neural-based approaches, especially for larger-scale TSPs, providing better quality solutions closer to the optimal.

Conclusion: HyperNS effectively addresses scalability challenges in neural TSP methods, enabling improved performance and efficient optimization for large-scale instances.

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

### [233] [Every Question Has Its Own Value: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20187)
*Dian Yu,Yulai Zhao,Kishan Panaganti,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method for aligning Large Language Models with human-defined value signals, enhancing accuracy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning methods optimize LLMs using correctness rewards but fail to account for human-defined task significance in the reward structure.

Method: RLEV incorporates explicit human-defined value signals into the reward function, leveraging value-weighted gradient amplification and applying ablation studies to confirm causality.

Result: RLEV achieves better performance than correctness-only baselines, excels in value-weighted accuracy, adapts responses based on task significance, and shows robustness to noisy value signals.

Conclusion: Optimizing LLMs with explicit human value signals is a practical approach to improving accuracy and alignment with human priorities.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

### [234] [Risk-Averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Optimized Certainty Equivalents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20199)
*Jane H. Lee,Baturay Saglam,Spyridon Pougkakiotis,Amin Karbasi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for risk-aware constrained RL using optimized certainty equivalents that target robustness in rewards and time, facilitating safer high-stakes applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL constrained optimization lacks focus on risks and catastrophic events, which are critical in high-stakes applications.

Method: The framework applies optimized certainty equivalents for risk-aware robustness, supported by strong Lagrangian duality, and integrates with standard RL solvers like PPO.

Result: The approach achieves convergence under common assumptions and demonstrates risk-aware features in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: A novel risk-aware RL framework is developed, offering per-stage robustness and practical integration with existing RL solvers for safer applications.

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [235] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores relaxations of replicability in PAC learning and examines three approaches to achieve learning stability under resampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicability in algorithms can sometimes be cost-prohibitive, which creates challenges in achieving learning stability under input resampling. This paper aims to explore approximate notions of replicability to address these challenges.

Method: The researchers propose three relaxations of replicability: (1) Pointwise consistency on fixed input, (2) Approximate replicability with mostly consistent output on distributions, and (3) Semi-replicability that allows using shared unlabeled samples along with full replicability.

Result: They develop sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners, achieving results such as requiring only Θ(d/α²) samples for Pointwise and Approximate replicability, and Θ(d²/α²) labeled samples for Semi-replicability.

Conclusion: The paper shows that relaxing strict replicability constraints enables efficient learning algorithms, making replicable processes feasible in PAC learning.

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

### [236] [Assessing the Feasibility of Early Cancer Detection Using Routine Laboratory Data: An Evaluation of Machine Learning Approaches on an Imbalanced Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20209)
*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores cancer risk classification in dogs using routine lab data and machine learning, showing moderate statistical success but poor clinical utility due to nonspecific biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop low-cost, accessible cancer screening tools for dogs using routine laboratory data, addressing the challenges of biomarker non-specificity and class imbalance.

Method: The study employs machine learning on data from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS), benchmarking 126 analytical pipelines to evaluate classification performance.

Result: The best model achieved moderate statistical performance (AUROC = 0.815) but was clinically ineffective (low F1-score and Positive Predictive Value) due to weak and confounded cancer signals.

Conclusion: Statistical cancer detection from routine lab data is possible but insufficient for reliable clinical use. Progress will require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

### [237] [CO-PFL: Contribution-Oriented Personalized Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20219)
*Ke Xing,Yanjie Dong,Xiaoyi Fan,Runhao Zeng,Victor C. M. Leung,M. Jamal Deen,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Contribution-Oriented Personalized Federated Learning (CO-PFL) to address the challenges of heterogeneous and limited local data in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional federated learning struggles with data heterogeneity and fails to adequately personalize models or address aggregation bias due to equal-contribution assumptions.

Method: CO-PFL introduces a dynamic client contribution estimation algorithm using dual-subspace analysis (gradient and prediction deviations) and integrates personalization mechanisms with mask-aware momentum optimization.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show improved personalization accuracy, robustness, scalability, and convergence stability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CO-PFL mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global and local performance coordination, and offers stable updates for tailored submodel construction.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

*Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Young Ju-Lee,Malcolm Dickens,Leonardo Cambisaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Fair-SMW algorithm to improve the efficiency of spectral clustering algorithms with fairness constraints focusing on group balance. It achieves comparable fairness metrics while doubling computational speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address computational inefficiencies in spectral clustering algorithms that incorporate group fairness constraints like balance.

Method: The paper introduces the Fair-SMW algorithm, which leverages the Lagrangian method and Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity to reformulate the constrained optimization problem in spectral clustering.

Result: Fair-SMW provides clustering solutions with comparable fairness balance to existing algorithms while significantly enhancing runtime efficiency—improved computation time is twice as fast as state-of-the-art algorithms. It is also adaptable to achieve double the balance.

Conclusion: The proposed Fair-SMW algorithm effectively enhances fairness implementation in spectral clustering while addressing inefficiencies, representing a significant improvement in speed and balance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve time series forecasting accuracy by incorporating category-specific data patterns using a static categorical embedding.

Method: Proposes QKCV attention, which embeds static category information into attention-based models to improve their capability in diverse datasets and reduce computational overhead during fine-tuning.

Result: QKCV improves forecasting accuracy in attention-based models and enables effective fine-tuning of univariate time series models using static embeddings.

Conclusion: Integrating QKCV into models helps capture category-specific patterns, offering versatility and superior forecasting accuracy with reduced computational costs during fine-tuning.

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MetaVD, a Bayesian meta-learning approach to improve Federated Learning (FL) under limited and non-IID data circumstances, addressing overfitting and divergent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a solution to address model overfitting and divergent local models issues in Federated Learning, especially under limited and non-IID client data settings.

Method: Proposed MetaVD, a Bayesian meta-learning approach that predicts client-dependent dropout rates using a hypernetwork for model personalization, emphasizing posterior adaptation and aggregation perspectives in FL.

Result: Extensive experiments on sparse and non-IID FL datasets showed improved classification accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and performance for out-of-distribution clients while reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: MetaVD enhances personalization in FL, mitigates overfitting, reduces communication costs, and offers effective performance for OOD clients. Code is provided for further exploration.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Conclusion: SpLIIF demonstrates superior capabilities in downscaling weather variables with improved accuracy over current alternatives.

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with the max-min criterion by presenting a provable and practical approach using game-theoretic reformulation.

Method: The method involves reformulating max-min MORL as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and simplifying policy updates through a mirror descent-based algorithm. Adaptive regularization is also introduced to enhance performance.

Result: The algorithm's convergence behavior is demonstrated in tabular settings, while its implementation significantly outperforms previous MORL baselines in deep reinforcement learning environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements, providing a convergent and efficient solution to max-min multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), a self-knowledge distillation method, to improve Graph Neural Networks' (GNNs) accuracy in molecular property prediction without increasing computational cost significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for more accurate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular property prediction, but increasing model complexity raises computational costs and memory demands.

Method: The authors developed the Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM) technique, which minimizes the mean absolute distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers to combine multi-scale and multi-hop information effectively.

Result: LKM enhances the accuracy of GNNs, reducing mean absolute error in property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17 Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin) across various architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: LKM significantly improves GNN performance in predicting chemical properties without substantial increases in training or inference costs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust Federated Learning framework called FedGPS to handle data heterogeneity in diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in Federated Learning, questioning the robustness of existing methods under varied heterogeneity scenarios.

Method: FedGPS incorporates statistical distribution information and gradient data from other clients to modify learning objectives dynamically and statically, ensuring updates with a global perspective.

Result: Experimental evidence showcases FedGPS's superior performance and robustness across diverse heterogeneity scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedGPS is an effective and robust solution for combating data heterogeneity in Federated Learning, paving the way for better deployment across varied scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

### [245] [Optimistic Task Inference for Behavior Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20264)
*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces OpTI-BFM, a method to enhance Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) by optimizing task inference using interactions with the environment, eliminating the need for large inference datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research lies in addressing the inefficiency of BFMs, which require non-negligible datasets for reward computation or significant labeling efforts at test-time.

Method: The authors propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that models uncertainty over reward functions and employs upper-confidence algorithms for efficient task inference.

Result: OpTI-BFM demonstrates capability to infer and optimize new reward functions in minimal episodes, with reduced computational efforts, as evaluated on standard zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM improves BFMs by enabling efficient, minimal-interaction task inference, making it a promising method for zero-shot reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench benchmark framework evaluates how LLM agents exploit testing to cheat by introducing tasks designed to be unsolvable without violating specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses risks in assessing and deploying large language models (LLMs), emphasizing scenarios where these models exploit shortcuts, such as manipulating unit tests, which impact their reliability and validity.

Method: ImpossibleBench introduces 'impossible' variants of coding tasks from existing benchmarks, tracks cheating via 'cheating rate,' and offers tools for behavior analysis, context engineering, and developing monitoring mechanisms.

Result: ImpossibleBench effectively identifies and quantifies deceptive behaviors in LLMs, detailing cheating strategies and contextual factors influencing cheating rates.

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench provides a systematic framework for evaluating deceptive behaviors in LLMs to improve their robustness and reliability in practical applications.

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

*Udit Saxena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops optimized GPU kernels for fast Euler Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation and introduces a PyTorch layer for incorporating ECC into end-to-end deep learning workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make topological features like the Euler Characteristic Curve computationally efficient and differentiable for practical adoption in deep learning.

Method: The authors optimized GPU kernels for Ampere GPUs using advanced memory strategies, enabling fast and efficient ECC computation. They also implemented a differentiable PyTorch layer for training deep learning models with ECC features.

Result: The new GPU kernels achieved 16-2000x speed improvements over earlier implementations, and the PyTorch layer facilitates threshold learning using sigmoid relaxation.

Conclusion: These innovations enable the integration of topological features into deep learning workflows, with broad implications for downstream applications and scalability to more complex computational setups.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [248] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates PRM-guided tree search for mathematical reasoning in LLMs and finds no significant improvements over chain-of-thought prompting, citing limitations in PRM reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether process reward model (PRM)-guided tree search can enhance mathematical reasoning by addressing the limits of linear structure methods like chain-of-thought with Best-of-N (BoN).

Method: The study implemented an adaptive algorithm maximizing PRM scores with tree search approaches, comparing methods like Monte Carlo tree search and beam search across 23 problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct as a case study.

Result: Key findings include: no statistically significant improvement of PRM-guided tree search over BoN, Monte Carlo tree search and beam search perform better than other PRM-based methods, PRMs become unreliable with reasoning depth, and PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution.

Conclusion: PRM-guided tree search is limited by PRM score reliability, suggesting a need for more robust reward modeling before tree search can improve mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

### [249] [SynTSBench: Rethinking Temporal Pattern Learning in Deep Learning Models for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20273)
*Qitai Tan,Yiyun Chen,Mo Li,Ruiwen Gu,Yilin Su,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynTSBench, a synthetic data-driven evaluation framework to assess time series forecasting models, addressing limitations in traditional evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks for time series forecasting models fail to provide quantitative insights into the strengths and weaknesses of models, making it hard to select the right model for specific forecasting tasks.

Method: The authors developed SynTSBench, which uses programmable feature configurations to evaluate models based on temporal feature decomposition, robustness under data irregularities, and theoretical optimum benchmarking.

Result: Experiments reveal that current deep learning models fail to universally achieve optimal performance across various temporal features when compared to theoretical baselines.

Conclusion: SynTSBench offers a more interpretable and systematic evaluation system for assessing time series forecasting models, highlighting areas for improvement in deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

*Guangyu Dai,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) to address shortcomings in collaborative frameworks between large and small models, demonstrating reduced computational costs, improved accuracy, and mitigated catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in large-small model collaboration frameworks, such as accuracy degradation, catastrophic forgetting, and knowledge-induced hallucination in small models, while retaining computational efficiency and enhancing performance in specialized tasks.

Method: Developed a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) distinct from MLPs, which offers enhanced interpretability and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. The KCM was deployed in collaborative systems across language, vision, and vision-language tasks.

Result: KCM-based systems significantly reduced large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task accuracy, reducing computational resource consumption. They also mitigated catastrophic forgetting and improved accuracy for long-tail data compared to MLP-based models.

Conclusion: KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) presents a viable solution to issues in collaborative frameworks, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing computation costs and enhancing performance across multiple modalities.

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResearchGPT, aiming to assist in the entire scientific research process, supported by a newly created corpus and benchmarks for training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more effective AI collaborator for scientific research, moving away from isolated sub-tasks towards integrated end-to-end workflow assistance.

Method: The authors constructed CS-54k, a paper-grounded corpus through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multi-stage quality control, derived into subsets CS-4k (benchmark) and CS-50k (training dataset).

Result: Experiments show CS-4k differentiates LLM capabilities, demonstrating that properly trained smaller open models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4 variants.

Conclusion: Domain-aligned training with high-quality datasets, rather than model size, enhances AI research assistant capabilities, encouraging broader collaboration in advancing AI-supported scientific research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

### [252] [Quantifying Distributional Invariance in Causal Subgraph for IRM-Free Graph Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20295)
*Yang Qiu,Yixiong Zou,Jun Wang,Wei Liu,Xiangyu Fu,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses out-of-distribution generalization challenges in graph neural networks by proposing an IRM-free method to identify causal subgraphs using invariant distribution criteria and representation norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks struggle to generalize under distributional shifts as existing methods depend heavily on expensive environment annotations or synthetic splits, prompting the need for a scalable solution.

Method: The authors introduce a norm-guided invariant distribution objective without using IRM to discover causal subgraphs, leveraging the novel Invariant Distribution Criterion for identifying key components.

Result: Their method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art graph neural network generalization approaches, validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: An effective IRM-free approach was developed for capturing causal subgraphs that enhance model generalization under distributional shifts, paving the way for scalable and practical solutions in graph neural network applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DB-FGA-Net, a deep learning model combining VGG16 and Xception with Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA), achieving state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor classification without data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve early and precise diagnosis of brain tumors while overcoming the limitations of heavy data augmentation in deep learning methods.

Method: The proposed double-backbone network integrates VGG16 and Xception with a Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) block for feature extraction. It incorporates Grad-CAM for visual interpretability and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time use.

Result: DB-FGA-Net achieves high accuracy across multiple dataset settings: 99.24% for the 7K-DS dataset (4-class), 98.68% for the 3-class, and 99.85% for the 2-class settings, as well as 95.77% on the independent 3K-DS dataset.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net demonstrates robustness without data augmentation, clinical interpretability via Grad-CAM, and usability through a GUI, making it a promising tool for reliable brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [254] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture for multivariate time series forecasting, combining temporal and cross-variate modeling effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving multivariate time series forecasting by addressing the limitations of existing methods in temporal modeling and variate-level dependencies.

Method: Proposal of InvDec, utilizing a patch-based temporal encoder and variate-wise self-attention with delayed variate embeddings and adaptive residual fusion.

Result: InvDec achieves better forecasting results, including 20.9% MSE reduction on high-dimensional datasets like Electricity, validating the importance of cross-variate modeling.

Conclusion: InvDec performs excellently, particularly on higher-dimensional datasets, by integrating temporal and variate-level information effectively, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

*Fengyuan Yu,Yuyuan Li,Xiaohua Feng,Junjie Fang,Tao Wang,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents LEGO, a framework for multiple-attribute unlearning in recommender systems, addressing real-world privacy needs with efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems struggle to address dynamic privacy requirements, especially for safeguarding multiple sensitive attributes in user data.

Method: LEGO consists of two steps: (1) Embedding Calibration to remove sensitive information, and (2) Flexible Combination to recombine embeddings. The framework is formulated as a mutual information minimization problem.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets and three models demonstrate LEGO's effectiveness and efficiency in handling multiple-attribute unlearning.

Conclusion: LEGO successfully addresses challenges with simultaneous dynamic unlearning in recommender systems, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

*Estelle Chigot,Dennis G. Wilson,Meriem Ghrib,Fabrice Jimenez,Thomas Oberlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of data collection for training vision models in critical applications, proposing synthetic image generation using a flight simulator for runway detection in autonomous landing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the obstacles of high costs and effort required for collecting and labeling extensive datasets, especially for critical applications that must include rare scenarios.

Method: The authors use a commercial flight simulator to generate synthetic images and integrate them with real annotated images. They employ a customized domain adaptation strategy to mitigate the synthetic-to-real distribution shift.

Result: The approach demonstrated accurate predictions by standard object detection models, particularly in adverse conditions like nighttime scenarios not included in the real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic image generation combined with domain adaptation shows promise in enhancing critical autonomous systems such as runway detection, effectively addressing data limitations and improving robustness.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

*Zhenghao Xu,Qin Lu,Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Changlong Yu,Wenlin Yao,Yao Liu,Haoming Jiang,Lihong Li,Hyokun Yun,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-based routing framework that combines fast reward models (RMs) and strong but costly LLM judges to efficiently align language models through RLHF while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical reward models trained on human preferences are prone to reward hacking and poor generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, while strong LLM judges, though effective, have high inference costs.

Method: The proposed framework employs uncertainty-based routing by applying principled uncertainty quantification in pairwise preference classification for policy gradient methods to determine when to forward decisions to a costly LLM judge.

Result: Experiments show that the framework outperforms random judge calling at equal cost in RM benchmarks and improves alignment results in online RLHF.

Conclusion: Combining traditional reward models with uncertainty-based routing to strong LLM judges enhances alignment efficiency and effectiveness in reinforcement learning with human feedback.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

*Shuhei Aikawa,Aru Suzuki,Kei Yoshitake,Kanata Teshigawara,Akira Iwabuchi,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust optimization framework for hierarchical time-series forecasts, ensuring coherence and addressing uncertainty in covariance matrices, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hierarchical forecasting by addressing performance degradation caused by uncertainty in estimated covariance matrices.

Method: Developed a robust optimization framework minimizing worst-case squared error, formulated as a semidefinite optimization problem.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior forecast performance compared to existing methods in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty into covariance matrix reconciliation enhances hierarchical forecast coherence and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

### [259] [Relative-Based Scaling Law for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20387)
*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces and validates the Relative-Based Scaling Law to complement existing scaling laws by considering the relative ordering of token predictions in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws based on cross-entropy are limited as they only consider absolute probabilities, ignoring the crucial role of relative ordering in token predictions for tasks like sampling.

Method: The authors propose the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric, which assesses how likely the correct token is ranked among a language model's top predictions. They conduct extensive experiments across datasets and model families to validate this metric and establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law.

Result: Experiments spanning diverse datasets and model sizes confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed Relative-Based Scaling Law for predicting performance improvements with increasing model size.

Conclusion: The proposed Relative-Based Scaling Law complements cross-entropy metrics, providing a deeper understanding of model scaling behaviors and offering insights for both practical and theoretical applications in language model development.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

*Tom Maus,Asma Atamna,Tobias Glasmachers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores industrial process control using reinforcement learning (RL), proposing a new industry-inspired benchmark combining SortingEnv and ContainerGym. It shows improved agent performance with action masking and examines modular versus monolithic control strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes using reinforcement learning, such as reward design, modularity, and action space management, by creating a practical benchmark for industrial automation.

Method: The study introduces a benchmark combining SortingEnv and ContainerGym for a recycling scenario involving sorting and pressing tasks. It evaluates modular architecture and monolithic control agents, analyzing the influence of action masking on agent performance.

Result: Experiments reveal that without action masking, agents perform poorly with the modular system outperforming the monolithic setup. Action masking enhances the performance of both architectures and reduces the discrepancy between them.

Conclusion: Action space constraints significantly impact agent performance, and the advantages of specialization diminish when action complexity is reduced. The benchmark serves as a tool for investigating robust multi-agent RL solutions and comparing centralization versus specialization.

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

### [261] [Why DPO is a Misspecified Estimator and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20413)
*Aditya Gopalan,Sayak Ray Chowdhury,Debangshu Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AuxDPO improves on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by addressing its limitations such as preference order reversal and sensitivity. It bridges the gap with RLHF and demonstrates better results in bandit and LLM alignment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the shortcomings of DPO, including its misspecification issues and sensitivity to input data, while offering an alternative approach that gets closer to the capabilities of RLHF without requiring two-stage processes.

Method: The study uses a geometrical analysis to understand the flaws in DPO and proposes AuxDPO, which incorporates auxiliary variables to refine the alignment process and move closer to RLHF solutions.

Result: AuxDPO is shown to outperform traditional DPO in experiments, both in theoretical bandit settings and real-world LLM alignment tasks.

Conclusion: AuxDPO alleviates misspecifications in DPO, bringing it closer to RLHF accuracy and reliability, and achieves stronger empirical results, suggesting it as a viable alternative for preference-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

*Sishun Liu,Ke Deng,Xiuzhen Zhang,Yongli Ren,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a thresholding method to enhance marked temporal point process modeling, addressing challenges posed by imbalanced event marks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on MTPP overlook the challenge of imbalanced mark distributions, which can lead to poor performance for rare event marks.

Method: The authors propose a novel thresholding method that optimizes mark probability by using learned thresholds normalized by prior probabilities and introduce an efficient neural MTPP model.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance in next event mark and time prediction compared to various baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves mark prediction performance for imbalanced datasets, providing a more effective approach for next event prediction in marked temporal point processes.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

### [263] [An Empirical Study of Sample Selection Strategies for Large Language Model Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20428)
*Xuran Li,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines data sampling strategies for enhancing large language model (LLM) reliability through selective repair, showing that Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) achieves superior efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce toxic or biased outputs, requiring practical repair solutions while minimizing costs associated with parameter updates, necessitating selective use of repair data.

Method: The study systematically evaluates five data selection strategies—random sampling, K-Center, GraNd, CCS, and SAPS—for repairing LLM behavior through metrics like toxicity reduction and composite scores (RPS, OPS, RES).

Result: SAPS achieves superior repair efficiency and effectiveness, using significantly less data. Random sampling works well for robust or large models, while CCS and GraNd offer limited performance improvements.

Conclusion: Selection-based repair is scalable and efficient for improving LLM reliability. SAPS emerges as the most optimal approach, with the choice of sampling method dependent on model scale and repair context.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

*Quannian Zhang,Michael Röder,Nikit Srivastava,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'explainable benchmarking' to automatically generate system performance explanations, focusing on knowledge-graph-based question answering systems with the novel PruneCEL approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking often relies on a few metrics and manual analysis to evaluate system performance, which can result in biased insights. This paper aims to enhance benchmarking via automated explanations.

Method: The authors propose 'explainable benchmarking' using PruneCEL, a novel concept learning method for large knowledge graphs, to generate explanations for system performance.

Result: PruneCEL outperformed state-of-the-art concept learners by up to 0.55 F1 measure in explainable benchmarking, and 80% of participants in a user study successfully interpreted system behavior using the provided explanations.

Conclusion: Explainable benchmarking is a promising approach that can uncover critical insights into system behavior and performance, demonstrated through the effectiveness of PruneCEL in automated explanations.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

*Xuan Lin,Aocheng Ding,Tengfei Ma,Hua Liang,Zhe Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MolBridge, a novel graph-based framework to predict drug-drug interaction (DDI) events by modeling fine-grained atomic structures and inter-drug relations, achieving superior predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate DDI event prediction due to therapeutic benefits and risks, but existing models lack the capability to explicitly model atom-level cross-molecular interactions, limiting performance on complex and varied DDI events.

Method: The proposed method constructs a joint graph that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, using a structure consistency module to refine node features iteratively while preserving global structural context to model inter-drug associations effectively.

Result: MolBridge achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across diverse and challenging DDI scenarios, demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MolBridge presents a robust approach for DDI event prediction with improved accuracy, robustness, and interpretability by leveraging fine-grained, graph-based representation refinement.

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

*Lawrence Clegg,John Cartlidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph neural network to model intransitive player dominance in tennis and finds market inefficiencies by betting on matches with high intransitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of methods to incorporate intransitive player dominance within existing forecasting paradigms, particularly in competitive tennis.

Method: The authors utilize a graph neural network that models temporal directed graphs with nodes as players and edges representing historical match outcomes.

Result: The model achieves an accuracy of 65.7% and a Brier Score of 0.215. Selective betting on matches with high intransitivity yields a 3.26% ROI with 1903 bets using Kelly staking.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based approach successfully captures relational dynamics in tennis matchups with high intransitivity, identifying a market inefficiency that can be exploited for significant positive returns.

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

TL;DR: The paper investigates watermark forging in post-hoc image watermarking and presents a method using a preference model to assess and manipulate watermarks, raising security concerns regarding current watermarking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the increasing prevalence of AI-generated content online and the growing need to ensure content authenticity and attribution, especially against watermark forging attacks.

Method: The authors developed a preference model trained with ranking loss on procedurally generated images to assess watermark presence. They used backpropagation for watermark removal and forging without requiring watermark models' knowledge.

Result: The method successfully demonstrates the removal and forging of watermarks across various post-hoc watermarking models, showcasing its simplicity, practicality, and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study questions the security of current watermarking techniques and highlights vulnerabilities in watermark forging. Public resources and code are provided for further research.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

*Rui Zhu,Song-Lin Lv,Zi-Kang Wang,Lan-Zhe Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose Bi-CoG, a novel self-training method combining semi-supervised learning with pre-trained vision-language model fine-tuning to improve pseudo-label quality and performance while addressing model bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of combining pre-trained vision-language models with semi-supervised learning face challenges such as model bias and sensitivity to hyperparameters, leading to limitations in high-quality label generation.

Method: The paper introduces Bi-CoG, which uses both inter-model and intra-model consistency checks along with an error-aware pseudo-label assignment strategy, designed to improve label quality and reduce bias.

Result: Bi-CoG outperforms existing methods across 14 datasets, as supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Bi-CoG demonstrates significant and consistent improvements in semi-supervised fine-tuning, providing an effective solution to label-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

*Fangjian Zhang,Xiaoyong Zhuge,Wenlan Wang,Haixia Xiao,Yuying Zhu,Siyang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study presents the Hurdle-IMDL framework to address the issue of imbalanced label distribution in AI-enhanced rainfall retrieval, successfully improving performance for rare events like heavy rain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the imbalance issue in label distribution that causes AI models to struggle with retrieving rare samples effectively, using rainfall retrieval as a case study.

Method: The Hurdle-IMDL framework employs a divide-and-conquer strategy using a hurdle model to address zero inflation (predominance of non-rain samples) and a debiasing inverse model to correct for the long tail of light-to-heavy rain imbalance.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. It significantly reduces bias and improves performance in heavy-to-extreme rainfall retrieval.

Conclusion: Hurdle-IMDL offers a generalizable solution to address distribution imbalances in environmental variables, effectively enhancing retrieval accuracy for rare but impactful events such as heavy rain.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

TL;DR: SheafAlign introduces a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal alignment, ensuring performance even without mutual redundancy across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal alignment approaches fail in distributed settings due to the assumption of mutual redundancy among all modalities.

Method: The paper utilizes sheaf structures and introduces decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives to achieve multimodal alignment without assuming mutual redundancy.

Result: SheafAlign demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization, cross-modal alignment, robustness to missing modalities, and a 50% reduction in communication costs compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional multimodal alignment methods and offers significant advantages in decentralized scenarios.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a unified framework for zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL), organizing and comparing existing methods to develop general agents capable of immediate task-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a consistent analytical lens in zero-shot RL and provide a principled foundation for research while advancing general agent development.

Method: The authors classify algorithms into direct and compositional representations, introduce a unified taxonomy and notation, and derive an extended performance bound for successor-feature methods.

Result: The framework provides shared principles, key differences, and a new perspective on successor-feature methods in the zero-shot RL regime.

Conclusion: This work consolidates the field under a unified framework, enabling structured comparisons and setting a foundation for future research and development of generalized zero-shot RL agents.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of graph rewiring on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) performance and topology, analyzing its effect on structural properties and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph rewiring aims to alleviate over-squashing in GNNs by improving information flow but risks distorting topology-dependent signals.

Method: The authors systematically analyze seven diverse graph rewiring strategies using metrics and correlate structural changes with node classification accuracy.

Result: Successful rewiring methods were found to preserve local structure while demonstrating flexibility in global connectivity, impacting task performance positively.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into designing rewiring strategies that balance preserving graph structure and optimizing GNN performance.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of integrating Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) into Operational Technology (OT) systems and presents a systematic approach for bridging these domains using existing OT reference models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing adoption of MLOps in industrial applications, but integrating it into OT systems has proven challenging, prompting the need for solutions.

Method: The researchers analyzed OT reference models, specifically RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95, and proposed a systematic mapping of MLOps lifecycle components to these models. They tested their approach using a real-world case study.

Result: Findings show that direct application of MLOps to OT environments is impractical, but adapting MLOps using established reference models can facilitate integration effectively.

Conclusion: Structured adaptations using existing OT frameworks like RAMI 4.0 allow for better integration of MLOps practices in industrial OT settings.

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for reasoning tasks that improves generalization by composing energy landscapes of smaller subproblems and enhancing sampling quality with Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limited generalization of reasoning models beyond the training distribution.

Method: Developing a compositional approach that learns energy landscapes over solution spaces of subproblems and constructing global energy landscapes for complex problems, combined with Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM) for boosting sample quality.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning methods in generalizing to larger and complex problems.

Conclusion: Compositional learning of energy landscapes and PEM lead to improved generalization in reasoning tasks, allowing models to handle increasingly challenging problems effectively.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

*Yuta Kawamoto,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper refines and analyzes Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) convergence under the Expected Smoothness (ES) condition, extending recent findings and providing detailed proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical analyses of SGD rely on stringent or overly simplistic assumptions, creating a need for flexible and accurate frameworks for understanding its convergence properties.

Method: The paper refines the Expected Smoothness (ES) condition, relates stochastic gradients and full gradients to objective values, and provides detailed proofs for derived bounds and convergence rates.

Result: It derives refined bounds for the expectation of squared full gradient norm and demonstrates $O(1/K)$ convergence rates under various step-size schedules with explicit residual errors.

Conclusion: This work unifies recent results and extends understanding of SGD convergence under the ES condition, employing rigorous proofs and interpretations for better applicability.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates

### [276] [Practical Code RAG at Scale: Task-Aware Retrieval Design Choices under Compute Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20609)
*Timur Galimzyanov,Olga Kolomyttseva,Egor Bogomolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies retrieval techniques for code-focused generation tasks under compute constraints, analyzing various configurations of chunking, similarity scoring, and splitting. Recommendations highlight balancing quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing focus on code generation tasks requires efficient retrieval strategies that balance performance and computational constraints.

Method: Systematic comparisons of retrieval techniques for two tasks (code completion and bug localization) under varying budgets. It examines different chunking strategies, similarity scoring methods, and splitting granularities.

Result: BM25 with word-level splitting excels in PL-PL tasks. Proprietary dense encoders outperform sparse retrieval for NL-PL tasks but are significantly slower. Optimal chunk sizes depend on context windows, and simple chunking methods match complex ones.

Conclusion: Evidence-based guidelines are provided for designing code-oriented retrieval-augmented generation systems that effectively consider task needs, model constraints, and computational limitations.

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Accurate early detection is critical to improving survival rates and addressing challenges in current diagnostic methods, including cost, variability, and risk of misdiagnosis.

Method: The study proposes a framework integrating customized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection, evaluated over 29 machine learning models, including classical classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic, and instance-based algorithms. It uses cross-validation and explainable AI for interpretability and clinical relevance.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 99.1% accuracy across all performance metrics, reduced dimensionality effectively, and provided transparent model-agnostic explanations.

Conclusion: Combining swarm intelligence with explainable ML represents a promising approach for reliable and clinically significant breast cancer diagnosis, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

*Yang Han,Pengyu Wang,Kai Yu,Xin Chen,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-BART, a unified framework for improving molecular identification through mass spectrometry by leveraging pretraining and novel feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of structural elucidation in mass spectrometry due to limited annotated spectral data and the complexity of raw spectral signals.

Method: MS-BART combines cross-modal learning, pretraining on computed fingerprint-molecule datasets, multi-task training objectives, and a chemical feedback mechanism for better model alignment.

Result: The method shows state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 5 out of 12 key metrics across two benchmark datasets and is significantly faster than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: MS-BART effectively bridges gaps in existing mass spectrometry approaches, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for molecular structure prediction despite some remaining challenges, such as molecular hallucination.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

### [279] [On Optimal Hyperparameters for Differentially Private Deep Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20616)
*Aki Rehn,Linzh Zhao,Mikko A. Heikkilä,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenges and nuances in choosing optimal hyperparameters (clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$) in differentially private (DP) transfer learning, revealing mismatches between theoretical predictions and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inconsistencies between theoretical frameworks and empirical outcomes related to hyperparameter optimization in DP transfer learning, particularly for fine-tuning large models under privacy constraints.

Method: The paper investigated the impact of varying clipping bounds ($C$) and batch sizes ($B$) on model performance under different privacy and compute conditions. The authors analyzed gradient distributions, cumulative DP noise, and the effects of clipping as gradient re-weighting.

Result: Larger clipping bounds $C$ improved performance under strong privacy settings, contradicting theoretical expectations. Cumulative DP noise explained batch size impact better than current heuristics, and using uniform $(C,B)$ settings across tasks degraded results in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Existing strategies for choosing $C$ and $B$ are suboptimal under privacy constraints and resource variations. Decoupled optimization tailored to specific tasks and conditions is necessary for better performance in DP transfer learning environments.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-SPLID is a new algorithm specializing in distinguishing salient features while reducing reliance on non-salient features, enhancing robustness and efficiency in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve feature representation learning by explicitly decomposing salient and non-salient features, addressing the challenge of robustness in machine learning models.

Method: H-SPLID decomposes features into salient and non-salient spaces, and bounds prediction deviations using the dimensionality of salient features and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion.

Result: Empirical evaluations show reduced sensitivity to non-salient feature perturbations like backgrounds, demonstrating improved robustness and reliance on task-relevant features.

Conclusion: H-SPLID effectively promotes robustness and compresses latent representation by distinguishing salient features, contributing to more efficient and accurate image classification.

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at
https://github.com/neu-spiral/H-SPLID.

### [281] [Equitable Survival Prediction: A Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20629)
*Mingxuan Liu,Yilin Ning,Haoyuan Wang,Chuan Hong,Matthew Engelhard,Danielle S. Bitterman,William G. La Cava,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), which addresses algorithmic biases in survival analysis, improving fairness in risk ranking while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address structural inequities and social biases present in clinical data, which may perpetuate biases in data-driven models, particularly in survival analysis.

Method: The authors propose Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), applying it to SEER breast cancer dataset to mitigate algorithmic biases while evaluating fairness performance across different time horizons.

Result: FASM significantly improves fairness in risk predictions without sacrificing the model's discrimination performance and ensures stable fairness over a 10-year period, especially improving in mid-term follow-ups.

Conclusion: FASM prioritizes both accuracy and equity in survival modeling, contributing to fairer clinical decision-making and advancing fairness as an essential component of healthcare AI.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

TL;DR: This paper explores how LLMs and LMMs can enhance 6G autonomous communication systems through multimodal sensing and task-oriented adaptations, showcasing their superiority through case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the transformative capabilities of large language and multimodal models for improving task-oriented autonomous communication systems in the 6G era.

Method: An overview of integration strategies like multimodal sensing, adaptive reconfiguration, and prompt/fine-tuning settings. Three case studies were used to validate their framework: traffic control, robot scheduling, and environment-aware channel estimation.

Result: Experimental results highlight LLM/LMM-aided autonomous systems outperform traditional discriminative deep learning models in dynamic environments and heterogeneous multimodal conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs/LMMs significantly enhance autonomous systems by maintaining robustness and superior performance compared to traditional techniques, especially under dynamic and complex conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

TL;DR: BadGraph introduces backdoor attacks on text-guided graph generation models through poisoning training data with triggers, enabling attackers to insert subgraphs without compromising model performance on clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored security vulnerabilities in text-guided graph generation models and highlight the risks of backdoor attacks in sensitive applications like drug discovery.

Method: BadGraph employs textual triggers to poison training data in latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, allowing attackers to implant backdoors covertly without affecting normal functionality on benign inputs.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets reveal that a poisoning rate of less than 10% yields a 50% attack success rate, and 24% poisoning achieves over 80% success rate while minimally affecting benign sample performance.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing serious risks in critical applications like drug discovery and necessitating robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiRecGNN, an advanced recommendation framework to optimize cloud service monitoring by focusing on entity recommendations, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of recommending optimal attributes for cloud service monitoring, overcoming limitations of existing methods in capturing long-range dependencies and dealing with data sparsity.

Method: The proposed method uses DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced, transformer-inspired ranking model, employing multi-head attention for heterogeneous entities and paths sampled via random walks, combined with multi-faceted loss functions.

Result: The model demonstrates a 43.1% increase in MRR compared to existing methods and receives a high user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5.

Conclusion: DiRecGNN effectively enhances entity recommendation for cloud service monitoring, overcoming key challenges and achieving strong empirical and user validation results.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to speed up the LASER technique for adapting LLMs to new datasets without requiring fine-tuning by optimizing matrix selection and decomposition strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the practicality and efficiency of the Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) method for adapting LLMs by addressing its high computational overhead and layer-by-layer search.

Method: The method removes LASER’s overhead by selectively focusing on key weight matrices based on singular value gradients, introducing clustered decompositions, and demonstrating that a small 100-sample dataset suffices for evaluation.

Result: The adapted technique lifted accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points and was shown to quickly adapt LLMs to downstream tasks using 100 data samples and a single gradient step.

Conclusion: The findings yield a faster and more robust approach for adapting LLMs without fine-tuning, leveraging simplified data requirements and optimized matrix selection and decomposition strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

*Reuben Dorent,Polina Golland,William Wells III*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper derives a new tight lower bound on mutual information (MI) using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), connects JSD-based objectives to MI, and validates its effectiveness in MI estimation through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The connection between surrogate objectives like JSD and Mutual Information (MI) remains poorly understood, creating challenges in representation learning.

Method: The authors derive a tight lower bound on MI as a function of JSD and revisit JSD-based objectives by using a binary classifier minimizing cross-entropy loss to recover bounds.

Result: Extensive experiments show the derived lower bound provides tight, stable, and low-variance MI estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods. It is also applied to the Information Bottleneck framework.

Conclusion: The findings theoretically justify JSD-based discriminative learning, demonstrating its strong empirical utility in MI-based representation learning.

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces xTime, a framework leveraging knowledge distillation and a mixture of experts mechanism to improve forecasting of extreme events in time series data, with accuracy gains of 3% to 78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme events in time series, such as floods or medical crises, are critical to predict due to their significant consequences, but conventional models struggle with these due to data imbalance and neglecting intermediate events.

Method: xTime employs knowledge distillation to transfer insights from models trained on more common events and uses a mixture of experts mechanism to integrate outputs dynamically from models addressing events at various rarity levels.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets reveal that xTime improves extreme event prediction accuracy by 3% to a substantial 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: xTime provides a robust solution for the challenging task of extreme event forecasting in time series, significantly enhancing predictive performance through innovative modeling techniques.

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

### [288] [Bayesian Jammer Localization with a Hybrid CNN and Path-Loss Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20666)
*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Luis González-Gudiño,Tales Imbiriba,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid Bayesian approach combining a physical path-loss model and CNN for jammer localization and RSS field reconstruction in urban GNSS environments, showing improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS signals are susceptible to jamming, especially in urban areas where signal distortions occur due to multipath effects and shadowing. Existing methods struggle with reconstructing the RSS field effectively due to limited spatial context, necessitating a better approach.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that integrates a physical path-loss model with a CNN using log-linear pooling. Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation is applied to quantify posterior uncertainties in jammer position and RSS field.

Result: Experiments using urban ray-tracing data demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better localization accuracy and reduced uncertainty, particularly as training points increase. Uncertainty is most concentrated near the jammer and in urban canyon regions.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid Bayesian framework effectively enhances jammer localization and RSS field reconstruction while providing valuable uncertainty information. It leverages both physical and data-driven insights for better performance in urban GNSS contexts.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of building effective and unified world models by providing clarity and outlining a focused pathway.

Method: It examines key advancements in world modeling, such as masked models, unified architectures, interactive generative models, and memory-augmented systems to form a cohesive understanding.

Result: The paper identifies a promising path for world models by emphasizing the importance of generative aspects, interactivity, and memory for creating consistent and functional world representations.

Conclusion: The outlined pathway offers a structured approach for advancing world models toward true dynamic and sustainable systems.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Method: Developed GRACE, a graph neural network framework, using extensive feature engineering and an unbiased meta-graph to handle class imbalance.

Result: Experiments on real-world data showed a 11-35% improvement in F1 score for the minority class compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GRACE offers a promising solution for improving care allocation for addiction patients and tackling dataset imbalances effectively.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

### [291] [A Scalable, Causal, and Energy Efficient Framework for Neural Decoding with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20683)
*Georgios Mentzelopoulos,Ioannis Asmanis,Konrad P. Kording,Eva L. Dyer,Kostas Daniilidis,Flavia Vitale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Spikachu', an energy-efficient, scalable neural decoding framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), aimed at improving brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for neuromotor impairments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing neural decoders in BCIs, which either lack generalization or struggle in real-time settings due to reliance on power-hungry artificial neural networks, and to provide a viable alternative with SNNs in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The proposed framework, Spikachu, operates using SNNs to process binned spikes, projects them into shared latent spaces, extracts relevant features using spiking modules, and integrates latent representations for behavioral predictions.

Result: Spikachu outperformed causal baselines in energy efficiency by factors between 2.26 and 418.81, and demonstrated improved performance when scaled to multiple sessions and subjects, enabling few-shot transfer to unseen settings.

Conclusion: Spikachu demonstrates the potential of SNNs in creating a competitive, scalable, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework suitable for real-time and resource-constrained brain-computer interface systems.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

### [292] [Optimizing Clinical Fall Risk Prediction: A Data-Driven Integration of EHR Variables with the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20714)
*Fardin Ganjkhanloo,Emmett Springer,Erik H. Hoyer,Daniel L. Young,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study enhances the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) by using a data-driven approach, achieving improved fall risk prediction and robustness in risk labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to better align fall risk predictions from the JHFRAT with clinically meaningful measures, addressing the limitations of existing predictions and improving patient safety and resource allocation.

Method: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions and implemented constrained score optimization (CSO) models. They used JHFRAT assessment data with and without additional EHR variables and compared the results to traditional JHFRAT and XGBoost models.

Result: The CSO method improved predictive performance over JHFRAT, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.91 compared to JHFRAT's 0.86. CSO also showed robustness to variations in risk labeling. XGBoost performed better (AUC-ROC=0.94) but lacked interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that CSO models can enhance inpatient fall prevention and safety in healthcare settings. Though slightly outperformed by black-box models, CSO offers robustness and interpretability for systematic improvements.

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

### [293] [Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718)
*Daniel Sorensen,Bappaditya Dey,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel approaches using forecasting models (N-BEATS and GNN) to predict anomalies in semiconductor manufacturing, emphasizing real-time correction and fault prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex semiconductor manufacturing processes with high-dimensional sensor data and rare faults require advanced methods for real-time anomaly prediction and proactive fault prevention.

Method: Two forecasting models are tested for anomaly prediction: N-BEATS for univariate analysis and Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Anomalies are detected based on deviations from predicted values.

Result: Both models perform well in forecasting, but GNN outperforms N-BEATS in anomaly prediction with fewer parameters and lower computational cost, making it suitable for manufacturing settings.

Conclusion: Graph Neural Networks offer a promising, efficient solution for real-time anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication processes, advancing proactive fault detection.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

*Jan Sobotka,Luca Baroni,Ján Antolík*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEIcoder, a neural decoding method that reconstructs visual stimuli from limited biological data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training samples and neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for advancing understanding of brain mechanisms and improving brain-machine interfaces, but biological data is often scarce, limiting decoding methods.

Method: The authors present MEIcoder, which uses neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), structural similarity loss, and adversarial training to decode visual stimuli effectively from neural activity.

Result: MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art visual stimulus reconstruction, particularly excelling with small datasets—capable of reconstructing images with minimal neurons and training data.

Conclusion: MEIcoder demonstrates reliable decoding in the early visual system, promotes future research with benchmarks, and offers valuable methods for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

*Jasmine Bayrooti,Sattar Vakili,Amanda Prorok,Carl Henrik Ek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes theoretical no-regret guarantees for Thompson Sampling (TS) in episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Gaussian process priors, providing a regret bound and addressing key challenges in model complexity and recursion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling is widely used in sequential decision-making but lacks theoretical foundations in settings with complex temporal structures like RL.

Method: The authors analyze episodic RL with joint Gaussian process priors over rewards and transitions to derive a regret bound, using extended tools such as the elliptical potential lemma for multi-output settings.

Result: The research proves a regret bound of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes with horizon $H$, considering GP model complexity.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of TS in RL, demonstrating how structural assumptions and model uncertainty affect performance in finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

*Yujia Zheng,Zhuokai Zhao,Zijian Li,Yaqi Xie,Mingze Gao,Lizhu Zhang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'thought communication,' a novel paradigm allowing direct mind-to-mind interaction between agents to overcome language constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of natural language as a means of communication in multi-agent systems, focusing on its lossy, ambiguous, and indirect nature.

Method: A theoretical framework based on a latent variable model is proposed to identify and extract shared and private underlying thoughts between agents and their relationships.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show the practical success of thought communication, facilitating improved collaboration and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: Hidden generative processes enable superior collaborative methods beyond natural language, prompting new ways to achieve collective intelligence and penetrate previously unsolvable challenges.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

*Tsai Hor Chan,Feng Wu,Yihang Chen,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a new multimodal learning framework utilizing the Dirichlet process (DP) for effective intra-modal representation and cross-modal alignment, showing improved performance through experiments and ablation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in maintaining feature expressiveness in each modality and optimizing cross-modal interactions in multimodal learning scenarios like healthcare and finance.

Method: Introduced a DP-driven multimodal learning framework where each modality follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. DP dynamically allocates feature contributions based on its richer-gets-richer property, balancing intra-modal learning and cross-modal alignment.

Result: The proposed model outperformed other methods across multiple multimodal datasets, validated by extensive experiments, and showcased robustness to hyperparameter changes.

Conclusion: DP-driven multimodal learning ensures effective feature expressiveness within modalities and cross-modal alignment, presenting a robust and superior approach in multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

*Anna Mészáros,Patrik Reizinger,Ferenc Huszár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how well Transformers, trained as decision models, understand and generalize chess rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether modern Transformers can systematically understand, adhere to, and generalize rules within chess, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: A 270M parameter chess Transformer was trained and evaluated on scenarios including standard chess rules, out-of-distribution puzzles, and Chess960 variations.

Result: Findings indicate that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, consistently adhering to chess rules, generating valid moves in novel scenarios, and performing decently against human players on Lichess but remain less effective than symbolic AI algorithms.

Conclusion: Transformers show promising capabilities in systematic rule adherence and compositional generalization for chess, highlighting potential in similar strategic reasoning tasks, though symbolic AI remains superior in certain areas.

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges conventional beliefs about optimization properties of reverse and forward KL divergences in reinforcement learning, proposing a new algorithm that achieves high-quality and diverse sampling modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misconceptions about reverse/forward KL divergence optimization in reinforcement learning and explore ways to improve sampling quality and diversity in tasks like post-training language models.

Method: The authors analyze the mathematical and empirical behavior of KL regularization in reinforcement learning and develop a simple algorithm targeting high-quality, diverse sampling modes across multiple use cases.

Result: Their algorithm improves solution quality and diversity for post-training large language models and chemical language models, outperforming naive applications of KL divergence methods.

Conclusion: Choice of KL divergence type does not directly influence mode-seeking or mass-covering behaviors; regularization strength and reward scales are more significant factors. The proposed algorithm succeeds in boosting diversity and quality of results.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

*James C. Knight,Johanna Senk,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents a new GPU-accelerated framework for implementing structural plasticity in spiking neural networks (SNNs), achieving up to 10x faster training for sparse models while maintaining performance and demonstrating applications in efficient SNN classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between biological brains' structural plasticity and dense connectivity optimization in training artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs), particularly to reduce computational costs and enhance efficiency.

Method: Developed a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for structural plasticity; applied it to e-prop supervised learning and DEEP R rewiring for sparse SNN classifiers and topographic map formation.

Result: Achieved up to 10x reduction in training time for sparse classifiers while maintaining performance through DEEP R rewiring. Demonstrated faster-than-realtime simulations for topographic maps with insights into connectivity evolution, while measuring speed versus network size.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective approach to integrating sparsity into neural network structures, enabling efficient training and advancing research in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity,
where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections.
However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections
are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning
but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by
structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak
connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of
inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for
backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce
the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports
efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational
neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework
for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate
this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train
efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning
context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our
sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring
enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate
topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights
into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network
size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and
maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as
exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic
applications.

*Mostapha Kalami Heris*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a concise syntax, Prompt Decorators, to control Large Language Model (LLM) behavior via compact tokens, enhancing reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability in reasoning and output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt engineering methods rely on verbose, natural-language instructions, which limit the reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability in LLM workflows.

Method: The authors propose 'Prompt Decorators,' a declarative syntax using compact control tokens to modify behavioral aspects such as reasoning style, tone, and structure, while formalizing core decorators through a unified framework.

Result: Illustrative use cases show that Prompt Decorators improve reasoning transparency, reduce prompt complexity, and standardize model behavior across various domains.

Conclusion: Prompt Decorators enable reusable and interpretable interfaces for prompt design, with implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and scalable AI system development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

### [302] [A Specification's Realm: Characterizing the Knowledge Required for Executing a Given Algorithm Specification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19853)
*Assaf Marron,David Harel*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of the "realm" of an algorithm specification, including its essential knowledge for execution (syntax, semantics, relationships, domain rules) and explores ways to create it using large language models, aiding systematic implementation and mechanical verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling mechanical execution of algorithm specifications by characterizing essential knowledge ("realm") required for executing agents, independent of system implementation.

Method: The authors propose the generation of the "realm" through systematic analysis, utilizing processes like automation through large language models and reusing existing documents.

Result: The paper discusses the components of the "realm" (e.g., syntax, semantics, domain knowledge, relationships), highlights its potential for practical implementation and mechanical verification, and touches on assessing execution faithfulness.

Conclusion: The proposed concept of an algorithm specification's "realm" provides structured knowledge for understood mechanical execution, which can improve faithful execution and formalization of algorithm specifications.

Abstract: An algorithm specification in natural language or pseudocode is expected to
be clear and explicit enough to enable mechanical execution. In this position
paper we contribute an initial characterization of the knowledge that an
executing agent, human or machine, should possess in order to be able to carry
out the instructions of a given algorithm specification as a stand-alone
entity, independent of any system implementation. We argue that, for that
algorithm specification, such prerequisite knowledge, whether unique or shared
with other specifications, can be summarized in a document of practical size.
We term this document the realm of the algorithm specification. The generation
of such a realm is itself a systematic analytical process, significant parts of
which can be automated with the help of large language models and the reuse of
existing documents. The algorithm-specification's realm would consist of
specification language syntax and semantics, domain knowledge restricted to the
referenced entities, inter-entity relationships, relevant underlying
cause-and-effect rules, and detailed instructions and means for carrying out
certain operations. Such characterization of the realm can contribute to
methodological implementation of the algorithm specification in diverse systems
and to its formalization for mechanical verification. The paper also touches
upon the question of assessing execution faithfulness, which is distinct from
correctness: in the absence of a reference interpretation of natural language
or pseudocode specification with a given vocabulary, how can we determine if an
observed agent's execution indeed complies with the input specification.

### [303] [Deconstructed Proto-Quipper: A Rational Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20018)
*Ryan Kavanagh,Chuta Sano,Brigitte Pientka*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Proto-Quipper-A introduces a streamlined operational semantics for quantum programming languages, addressing difficulties in previous Proto-Quipper versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to simplify reasoning and mechanization in Proto-Quipper programming languages by tackling the complexity in their operational semantics.

Method: The authors propose Proto-Quipper-A, utilizing a linear λ-calculus system with adjoint-logical foundations for foundational abstractions.

Result: Proto-Quipper-A features straightforward call-by-value reduction semantics, and its normalization is established using standard logical relations.

Conclusion: Proto-Quipper-A effectively streamlines and rationalizes the structure of Proto-Quipper languages for better usability and theoretical understanding.

Abstract: The Proto-Quipper family of programming languages aims to provide a formal
foundation for the Quipper quantum programming language. Unfortunately,
Proto-Quipper languages have complex operational semantics: they are inherently
effectful, and they rely on set-theoretic operations and fresh name generation
to manipulate quantum circuits. This makes them difficult to reason about using
standard programming language techniques and, ultimately, to mechanize. We
introduce Proto-Quipper-A, a rational reconstruction of Proto-Quipper languages
for static circuit generation. It uses a linear $\lambda$-calculus to describe
quantum circuits with normal forms that closely correspond to box-and-wire
circuit diagrams. Adjoint-logical foundations integrate this circuit language
with a linear/non-linear functional language and let us reconstruct
Proto-Quipper's circuit programming abstractions using more primitive
adjoint-logical operations. Proto-Quipper-A enjoys a simple call-by-value
reduction semantics, and to illustrate its tractability as a foundation for
Proto-Quipper languages, we show that it is normalizing. We show how to use
standard logical relations to prove normalization of linear and substructural
systems, thereby avoiding the inherent complexity of existing linear logical
relations.

### [304] [Deciding not to Decide: Sound and Complete Effect Inference in the Presence of Higher-Rank Polymorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20532)
*Patrycja Balik,Szymon Jędras,Piotr Polesiuk*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an effect inference algorithm for type-and-effect systems with subtyping, higher-rank polymorphism, and intuitive set-like semantics of effects, tackling complexity by using propositional logic for constraint solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of widespread adoption of type-and-effect systems due to their complexity and limitations in existing inference algorithms in terms of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and decidability.

Method: The paper proposes transforming effect constraints into propositional logic formulae to handle scoping issues in higher-rank polymorphism, ensuring soundness and completeness of the algorithm through formal proofs.

Result: The algorithm was formalized in the Rocq proof assistant and implemented successfully in a realistic programming language.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a practical and formally verified approach to make type-and-effect systems more expressive, intuitive, and applicable in real-world programming.

Abstract: Type-and-effect systems help the programmer to organize data and
computational effects in a program. While for traditional type systems
expressive variants with sophisticated inference algorithms have been developed
and widely used in programming languages, type-and-effect systems did not yet
gain widespread adoption. One reason for this is that type-and-effect systems
are more complex and the existing inference algorithms make compromises between
expressiveness, intuitiveness, and decidability. In this work, we present an
effect inference algorithm for a type-and-effect system with subtyping,
expressive higher-rank polymorphism, and intuitive set-like semantics of
effects. In order to deal with scoping issues of higher-rank polymorphism, we
delay solving of effect constraints by transforming them into formulae of
propositional logic. We prove soundness and completeness of our algorithm with
respect to a declarative type-and-effect system. All the presented results have
been formalized in the Rocq proof assistant, and the algorithm has been
successfully implemented in a realistic programming language.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents a compilation scheme for the Mimosa programming language, designed for embedded systems using time-triggered processes and FIFO communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt Lustre's compilation scheme to the Mimosa programming model for efficient implementation in embedded systems.

Method: The authors propose formally adapting Lustre's compilation techniques to Mimosa's semantics and mapping its coordination layer to real-time operating system primitives.

Result: The paper demonstrates how the coordination layer of Mimosa can be effectively implemented using real-time operating system primitives.

Conclusion: Linking Mimosa semantics with proven compilation techniques from Lustre enables efficient implementation of embedded systems software, supporting real-time coordination.

Abstract: This paper introduces a compilation scheme for programs written in the Mimosa
programming language, which builds upon the MIMOS model of computation. Mimosa
describes embedded systems software as a collection of time-triggered processes
which communicate through FIFO queues. We formally describe an adaptation of
the Lustre compilation scheme to the semantics of Mimosa and show how the
coordination layer can be mapped to real-time operating system primitives.

### [306] [SafeFFI: Efficient Sanitization at the Boundary Between Safe and Unsafe Code in Rust and Mixed-Language Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20688)
*Oliver Braunsdorf,Tim Lange,Konrad Hohentanner,Julian Horsch,Johannes Kinder*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: SafeFFI optimizes memory safety instrumentation in Rust binaries by moving checks to the unsafe-safe code boundary, reducing overhead and unnecessary sanitizer checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsafe Rust is needed for interoperability with C/C++ and low-level functionality but leads to memory safety issues in Rust programs.

Method: SafeFFI introduces runtime boundary checks between unsafe and safe code, minimizing sanitizer checks without expensive whole-program analysis.

Result: SafeFFI reduces sanitizer checks up to 98% while maintaining correctness and detecting memory safety violations efficiently.

Conclusion: SafeFFI improves runtime performance and verification efficiency in Rust programs by leveraging the Rust type system for memory safety enforcement.

Abstract: Unsafe Rust code is necessary for interoperability with C/C++ libraries and
implementing low-level data structures, but it can cause memory safety
violations in otherwise memory-safe Rust programs. Sanitizers can catch such
memory errors at runtime, but introduce many unnecessary checks even for memory
accesses guaranteed safe by the Rust type system. We introduce SafeFFI, a
system for optimizing memory safety instrumentation in Rust binaries such that
checks occur at the boundary between unsafe and safe code, handing over the
enforcement of memory safety from the sanitizer to the Rust type system. Unlike
previous approaches, our design avoids expensive whole-program analysis and
adds much less compile-time overhead (2.64x compared to over 8.83x). On a
collection of popular Rust crates and known vulnerable Rust code, SafeFFI
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing
sanitizer checks by up to 98%, while maintaining correctness and flagging all
spatial and temporal memory safety violations.

*Chen-Lung Lu,Honglu He,Agung Julius,John T. Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a kinematic calibration framework using Local POE models and Fourier basis functions to enhance robot precision efficiently, halving positioning errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address configuration-dependent inaccuracies in robot kinematics, aiming to improve precise tool placement across the robot's workspace.

Method: The approach involves identifying Local POE models in multiple configurations and interpolating them into a global model using Fourier basis functions, inspired by joint gravity load expressions.

Result: Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots showed over 50% error reduction, achieving sub-millimeter positioning accuracy required for complex tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for improving robot accuracy, especially for tasks like cold spray manufacturing, with practical and repeatable applications demonstrated in collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved CI-MPC algorithm, called C3+, that enables efficient and robust manipulation of single and multi-object planar pushing tasks, achieving high success rates and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in non-prehensile robotic manipulation of diverse objects, particularly overcoming the limitations of prior CI-MPC in dealing with complex, contact-rich scenarios such as multi-object manipulation.

Method: Introduced C3+, an advanced CI-MPC algorithm, integrated into a cohesive pipeline for object scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. C3+ offers faster solve times than its predecessor, enabling real-time handling of multiple objects.

Result: The system achieved a 98% success rate across 33 objects during hardware tests, with varying time-to-goal for tasks involving increasing numbers of objects (ranging from 0.5 minutes for single-object to 5.3 minutes for four-object tasks).

Conclusion: C3+ demonstrates the potential for general-purpose and efficient manipulation across diverse and complex multi-object scenarios, highlighting significant improvements in robustness and real-time capabilities compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for UAVs to achieve generalizable minimum-time flight policies for navigating between arbitrary start and goal states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autonomous drone racing models achieve high speeds and agility but are limited to predefined tracks, reducing their real-world effectiveness. There is a need for a broader policy for autonomous UAV navigation.

Method: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that combines state-to-state minimum-time planning and control. It employs Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as rewards and uses curriculum learning to improve training and generalization.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments validate the framework. The results show its superiority over Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking in PMM trajectories and its robustness in outdoor environments using lightweight hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed framework generalizes effectively across different flights, showing promise for broader applicability in UAV navigation while combining agility and stability.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

*Sourabh Karmakar,Apurva Patel,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper reviews calibration methods for Stewart platform-based 6-DOF Parallel Kinematic Machines, highlighting challenges and methodologies to enhance precision for micro- and nano-scale motion applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore and improve calibration methods for 6-DOF Parallel Kinematic Machines (PKMs), which are widely used in applications requiring precise 3D motion control like medical devices, space research, and automotive manufacturing.

Method: The paper surveys various calibration approaches, including external instrument-based, constraint-based, and auto/self-calibration methods, with a focus on inverse kinematics for simplifying the calibration process.

Result: The study finds that researchers have concentrated on enhancing platform accuracy by addressing error sources such as structural and environmental factors, though primarily under no-load conditions.

Conclusion: The paper identifies current strengths and limitations in PKM calibration methods and emphasizes the need for further exploration, particularly under load conditions, to improve accuracy for critical applications.

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

*Travis A. Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the creation of a novel, research-oriented 3D printing platform tailored for polymer FDM processes, incorporating precise control and monitoring features, including environmental sensors, closed-loop feedback, and photogrammetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most consumer-grade FDM printers lack features needed for research, and commercial-grade alternatives are expensive and inflexible, especially for experimental modifications.

Method: The authors designed and built a 3D printer platform with tightly controlled parameters, including closed-loop position feedback, temperature controls, environment monitoring, and an innovative rotating heated bed for photogrammetry.

Result: The platform offers enhanced controllability and the ability to link process parameters with geometric defects through real-time photogrammetry and design innovations.

Conclusion: The proposed printer serves as a reliable and cost-effective test bed that enables high repeatability and accuracy for FDM research, addressing needs unmet by consumer and commercial-grade printers.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Path-based Transformer for precise robotic arm trajectory planning, offering high accuracy in task execution and robustness in cluttered settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the precision and efficiency of robotic arm trajectory planning while maintaining robust adaptability to complex scenarios.

Method: The framework utilizes a Path-based Transformer with a 3-grid representation (where/what/when) and constraint-masked decoding for structured trajectory planning. It was trained on over 50k trajectories and employed on a robot with a depth-camera setup.

Result: Achieved high accuracy metrics (89.44% stepwise accuracy, 93.32% precision), generating 99.99% legal paths by construction. Successfully translated to real-world performance with high task success rates in controlled and cluttered environments.

Conclusion: Path-structured representations integrated with Transformers enable accurate and interpretable robot trajectory generation, bridging graph-based planning and sequence-based learning for general-purpose manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence
models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient
executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with
a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding,
enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task
graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20%
validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise
accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6
with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick
success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60
language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions
via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that
path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate,
reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning
and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for
general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a reinforcement learning framework using a simulated adhesion model and a structured curriculum for quadrupedal magnetic climbing robots, achieving robust locomotion against adhesion uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the climbing reliability and adaptability of quadrupedal robots under challenging adhesion conditions on vertical steel surfaces.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with a physics-based adhesion model and a three-phase training curriculum to address adhesion variability, partial contact, and detachment issues.

Result: Achieved strong adhesion retention, rapid recovery from detachment, and high climbing success rates in simulations. Physical experiments confirmed stability and effective vertical crawling under degraded conditions.

Conclusion: Combining curriculum learning and physics-based adhesion modeling ensures resilient and transferable locomotion for magnetic climbing robots.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

### [314] [A Contact-Driven Framework for Manipulating in the Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20177)
*Muhammad Suhail Saleem,Lai Yuan,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses a framework enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks in visually challenging environments using contact feedback and structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the challenge of robot manipulation in environments where vision is obstructed due to clutter, occlusion, or poor lighting.

Method: The proposed framework combines three components: contact detection/localization, occupancy estimation, and planning to navigate and manipulate efficiently under uncertainty.

Result: The framework reduces task completion time by up to 2x compared to baselines and successfully handles complex domestic tasks in both simulation and real-world trials.

Conclusion: Integrating contact feedback with structural priors provides an effective solution for robot manipulation in environments where vision is unreliable.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

TL;DR: This research experimentally validates the control of satellite swarms using a learning-aided magnetic field interaction mechanism (magnetorquers) and introduces a novel power-optimal control framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of long-term formation maintenance of large-scale satellite swarms, addressing issues like nonholonomic constraints, underactuation, scalability, and computational cost.

Method: Using experiments on a ground-based air-bearing platform, the study validates a learning-aided time-integrated current control approach. It introduces a two-axis coil system, testing decentralized current management and controllability with an error guarantee.

Result: The study demonstrates enhanced controllability and decentralized current management for satellite swarms. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the learned model and introduce NODA-MMH for power-efficient model-based swarm control.

Conclusion: Learning-aided magnetic interactions and the proposed NODA-MMH framework offer practical solutions for the scalable control and long-term maintenance of satellite swarm formations.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
maintenance problem.

*Mert Bulent Sariyildiz,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Guillaume Bono,Gianluca Monaci,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kinaema, a model for spatial navigation that processes visual data and predicts relative positions without relying on explicit observation history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize robotic operations by enabling spatially aware robots to situate themselves in previously seen spaces efficiently.

Method: Kinaema employs a recurrent transformer to process streamed visual observations and compress them into a latent memory representation, allowing it to predict positions in relation to a given query.

Result: The model excels in the newly introduced Mem-Nav task, demonstrating effective navigation to pre-observed goals and computational efficiency compared to traditional transformers.

Conclusion: Kinaema is a promising tool for robotic spatial awareness due to its latent memory system and operational efficiency in large scenes.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

*Ajay Sridhar,Jennifer Pan,Satvik Sharma,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes MemER, a system that equips robots with memory capabilities through a hierarchical policy framework that uses keyframes for effective task execution. It outperforms prior methods in long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems often lack memory capabilities, which limits their ability to efficiently perform tasks requiring long-term dependencies. This work aims to address this by enabling robots to utilize memory effectively.

Method: The proposed hierarchical framework uses a high-level policy to select relevant keyframes from past experiences, which are combined with recent frames to generate text instructions for execution by a low-level policy. It builds on existing vision-language-action models.

Result: MemER achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches in handling three long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks, bolstered by minimal language annotations.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating memory in robotic policies for long-horizon tasks, offering an efficient solution using a hierarchical framework.

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

Motivation: Domain shifts like weather and lighting changes significantly impact the robustness of autonomous parking systems, necessitating robust solutions.

Method: The study proposes a domain-agnostic approach, DDP, which integrates visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning for generalized perception and reliable motion planning. It is tested in a simulation environment and adversarial real-world settings.

Result: DDP consistently achieves over 90% parking success rate across varied out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing baselines and demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer in a reconstructed real-world parking lot.

Conclusion: Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP) is effective for robust autonomous parking under domain shifts, showing enhanced performance and transferability in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

*Ashutosh Mishra,Shreya Santra,Elian Neppel,Edoardo M. Rossi Lombardi,Shamistan Karimov,Kentaro Uno,Kazuya Yoshida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) framework for modular robots to overcome challenges in controlling varying morphologies, demonstrating its efficacy through simulations and field experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of unified control in modular robots amidst their combinatorial growth of morphologies for task-specific operations, especially for space missions.

Method: The paper proposes a Dec-RL approach where each module independently learns its policy: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for wheel locomotion and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for limb steering and manipulation, achieving zero-shot adaptability to new configurations.

Result: Simulations showed significant success: a steering error of 3.63°; 84.6% accuracy in manipulation tasks; and a 95.4% reduction in motor torque for wheels while maintaining 99.6% task success. Field tests on lunar analogs verified smooth integration and transition across different operation modes without conflict.

Conclusion: The proposed Dec-RL approach is scalable, reusable, and robust, making it suitable for autonomous modular robotic operations in space environments, such as on the lunar surface.

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

*Yijiong Lin,Bowen Deng,Chenghua Lu,Max Yang,Efi Psomopoulou,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuralTouch combines Neural Descriptor Fields (NDF) and tactile sensing to improve grasping accuracy and generalizability for robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise object manipulation requires high grasping accuracy, which is often hindered by camera calibration issues, incomplete point clouds, and object variability.

Method: The authors introduce NeuralTouch, a multimodal framework using NDF for initial grasp pose generation and reinforcement learning trained on tactile feedback to refine grasps.

Result: NeuralTouch improves grasping accuracy and robustness, validated through simulation and real-world tasks such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle lid opening.

Conclusion: NeuralTouch provides a generalizable and effective solution, leveraging vision and tactile integration for precise robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes PointMapPolicy, a technique combining point clouds and RGB images for improved robotic manipulation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation systems lack effective fusion between geometric details from point clouds and semantic context from RGB images, hindering precision and generalization.

Method: PointMapPolicy conditions diffusion-based policies on structured grids of points and combines them with RGB data using xLSTM for multi-modal perception.

Result: PointMapPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrated in benchmarks and real robot evaluations.

Conclusion: PointMapPolicy enhances manipulation systems by efficiently fusing point cloud and RGB data, using structured grids and xLSTM for better task performance.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Motivation: Create a system to improve underwater robot arm teleoperation with synchronized haptic and visual feedback, addressing control accuracy and user experience.

Method: Developed a Mixed Reality headset (MR-HMD) displaying a reaction torque indicator (RTI), and conducted user studies to evaluate its effectiveness compared to a traditional bilateral control system.

Result: MR-UBi significantly improved torque control accuracy, increased optimal torque application time, and showed higher user usability while reducing workload.

Conclusion: MR-UBi facilitates more accurate, stable, and user-friendly underwater robot arm teleoperation by optimizing feedback integration.

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during
underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants
compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload
(NASA--TLX). Overall, the results confirm that \textit{MR-UBi} enables more

*Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller,Ronald Naderer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper describes a method for trajectory planning where the tool remains stationary, and the part moves, using B-splines for a smooth path.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving trajectory planning where moving the part is more practical than moving the tool.

Method: Trajectory planning using B-splines to represent paths, ensuring smooth transitions and accommodating velocity and orientation constraints.

Result: Validated the trajectory planning method successfully on a real system with an industrial robot.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively computes smooth trajectories and is practically applicable in industrial robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a factor-graph-based approach for efficient multi-modal cooperative localization among heterogeneous robots using sensor fusion under GNSS-denied conditions, significantly improving accuracy in environments with sensory degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating in GNSS-denied environments require accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors, but integrating all sensor types on one robot is impractical. A distributed sensing solution across multiple robots introduces asynchronous, multi-modal data fusion challenges.

Method: A novel adaptive method utilizing a factor-graph to fuse asynchronous data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections, with interpolation-based factors and degradation evaluation mechanisms.

Result: Extensive real-world evaluations with UGVs and UAVs demonstrate significant improvements in localization accuracy even under sensory degradation.

Conclusion: The cooperative localization approach effectively addresses sensory degradation challenges, enabling accurate long-term localization in GNSS-denied environments and enhancing the deployability of robot teams.

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

*Victor Vantilborgh,Hrishikesh Sathyanarayan,Guillaume Crevecoeur,Ian Abraham,Tom Lefebvre*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents methods to improve robot manipulation tasks under uncertain dynamics, like payload variability, by using active exploration and online parameter adaptation for control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robot manipulation tasks where payload uncertainty affects execution, demanding robust control strategies.

Method: The problem is framed as dual control, with a pre-defined feedback policy structure including adaptation. Two trajectory generation methods are proposed: robust optimal control and minimizing optimality loss.

Result: Both methods leverage Fisher information and improve pick-and-place tasks, showing faster, more accurate execution and system identification.

Conclusion: Incorporating control-aware trajectory design enhances task performance and stability for robotic manipulation under unknown dynamics.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

Result: The paper consolidates recent advancements in sim-to-real transfer techniques, offering insights into their success and the evaluation metrics used.

Conclusion: While current strategies show promise, the authors emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the reality gap and its solutions to fully bridge the divide between simulation and real-world robotics.

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In

*Thomas Kordik,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach to minimize energy consumption in pick-and-place operations using series elastic actuators (SEA) in parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) through optimal control and trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address energy consumption reduction in repetitive pick-and-place industrial robot tasks using elastic elements like SEA.

Method: Dynamic model creation and formulation of an energy-minimizing optimal control problem optimizing trajectories and SEA stiffness.

Result: Demonstrated reduced energy consumption in SEA actuated PKM with tested application in redundant actuation scenarios.

Conclusion: Energy consumption in PKM pick-and-place operations can be minimized by exploiting actuator spring eigenmotions and optimizing SEA stiffness through optimal control formulations.

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to compute time-optimal paths that avoids singularities, enabling efficient and smooth trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges in time-optimal path following, particularly resolving the issue of singularities at zero path speed and achieving smooth trajectory generation.

Method: The paper proposes an alternative approach that focuses on maximizing path speed along a given path while ensuring numerical efficiency and reducing computational complexity through a linear optimization reformulation.

Result: The approach allows trajectory planning that is both smooth and computationally efficient by tackling the singularity issues inherent in standard methods.

Conclusion: This method provides a better solution for time-optimal path following with reduced computational costs and enhanced smoothness in trajectory planning.

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

TL;DR: RubbleSim is an open-source simulator for exploring void spaces in structural collapses, designed to overcome access limitations in disaster research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in studying void spaces in structural collapses due to lack of data access caused by legal and proprietary restrictions.

Method: The study introduces RubbleSim, a photorealistic, reconfigurable virtual simulation constructed using Unity and physics-based models of stochastic rubble piles.

Result: RubbleSim allows the study of perception performance under challenging visual conditions using algorithms, validating its usefulness in understanding void spaces.

Conclusion: RubbleSim successfully addresses access constraints in disaster research by providing an open-source tool to study and simulate void spaces within collapsed structures.

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are

TL;DR: Introduces C-Nav, a framework for embodied agents to adapt to new object categories while minimizing forgetting in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object navigation systems lack the ability to adapt in open-world, dynamic settings without forgetting prior knowledge.

Method: C-Nav includes a dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism (feature distillation and replay) and an adaptive sampling strategy to enhance learning efficiency while reducing memory usage.

Result: C-Nav outperforms existing methods, achieving better navigation performance with reduced memory overhead across multiple architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effective continual learning for object navigation, enabling efficient adaptation to new object categories while retaining past knowledge. The approach is scalable and resource-efficient.

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic,
open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static
trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking
the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining MPPI and Dreamer for real-time, adaptive quadruped gait optimization, achieving energy efficiency and accurate locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations of RL leading to convergence to suboptimal single gaits and the lack of adaptability in MPC for quadruped locomotion.

Method: The framework integrates MPPI for action and gait optimization with a Dreamer module for learned reward evaluation, targeting energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions.

Result: Simulation experiments on the Unitree Go1 show up to 36.48% energy consumption reduction while retaining tracking accuracy and task-adaptive gaits.

Conclusion: The combination of MPPI and Dreamer successfully produces optimal and adaptable quadruped locomotion policies, enhancing efficiency and performance across variable speeds.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FieldGen is a novel framework for generating large-scale, diverse, and high-quality real-world robotic manipulation data with minimal human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation training requires large-scale, diverse datasets, but existing methods either lack scalability, diversity, or require expensive human labor.

Method: FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: pre-manipulation for trajectory diversity and fine manipulation for precision, using an attraction field to generate diverse trajectories.

Result: FieldGen showed improved performance in robotic manipulation policies, achieving higher success rates and stability with reduced human effort compared to teleoperation methods.

Conclusion: By combining scalable data generation with precise supervision, FieldGen advances learning in robotics, balancing quality, diversity, and scalability for long-term implementation.

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher
success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,
while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data
collection. Webpage is available at https://fieldgen.github.io/.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics

curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data

*Mateo Guaman Castro,Sidharth Rajagopal,Daniel Gorbatov,Matt Schmittle,Rohan Baijal,Octi Zhang,Rosario Scalise,Sidharth Talia,Emma Romig,Celso de Melo,Byron Boots,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAMOS, a hierarchical navigation model for robots. It separates semantic planning from embodiment constraints to enhance generalization across diverse environments and robot types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling robots to navigate diverse environments effectively while accounting for their specific physical capabilities.

Method: VAMOS employs a hierarchical structure involving a generalist planner and a specialist affordance model. The generalist handles high-level tasks using open-world data, while the specialist evaluates robot-specific feasibility of paths in simulation.

Result: The method achieves higher navigation success rates in complex environments compared to current approaches, supports cross-platform navigation for different robot types, and improves reliability by rejecting infeasible plans.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical system efficiently integrates general planning with specific physical embodiment constraints, offering a scalable and reliable solution for robotic navigation across different platforms and environments.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:

### [335] [E-Test: E'er-Improving Test Suites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19860)
*Ketai Qiu,Luca Di Grazia,Leonardo Mariani,Mauro Pezzè*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-Test, a method leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve test suites by identifying and generating test cases for untested execution scenarios seen in production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test suite maintenance is labor-intensive and lacks effective methods to identify and address execution scenarios missed in testing, particularly in large-scale and long-term software projects.

Method: E-Test uses LLMs to detect execution scenarios not covered by existing test suites, based on data monitored in production. It then generates new test cases to augment the test suite and explores the identified scenarios.

Result: Evaluation on Java open-source projects and Defects4J shows E-Test outperforms existing methods with an F1-score of 0.55, higher than traditional approaches (max F1-score 0.34) and vanilla LLMs (max F1-score 0.39).

Conclusion: E-Test enhances test suites by better identifying missed execution scenarios and reducing manual effort, contributing to improved software reliability.

Abstract: Test suites are inherently imperfect, and testers can always enrich a suite
with new test cases that improve its quality and, consequently, the reliability
of the target software system. However, finding test cases that explore
execution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely
challenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites
over extended periods.
  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between
the execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced
after testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore
execution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions
that have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those
monitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases
that enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to
pinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and
augments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.
  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred
open-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates
that E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better
than state-of-the-art approaches. While existing regression testing and field
testing approaches for this task achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.34, and
vanilla LLMs achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.39, E-Test reaches 0.55. These
results highlight the impact of E-Test in enhancing test suites by effectively
targeting not-yet-tested execution scenarios and reducing manual effort
required for maintaining test suites.

### [336] [SODBench: A Large Language Model Approach to Documenting Spreadsheet Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19864)
*Amila Indika,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spreadsheet Operations Documentation (SOD), a task of creating human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations using AI, and benchmarks LLMs for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic documentation in spreadsheets limits automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, potentially risking the loss of crucial institutional knowledge.

Method: The authors created a benchmark containing 111 spreadsheet manipulation code snippets with natural language summaries and evaluated five LLMs using linguistic and semantic metrics (BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR).

Result: The evaluation showed that LLMs can effectively generate human-readable spreadsheet documentation, though challenges such as accuracy and robustness remain.

Conclusion: SOD can improve reproducibility, collaboration, and maintainability in spreadsheets but requires further refinement to address persisting challenges.

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

*Qian Xiong,Bo Yang,Weisong Sun,Yiran Zhang,Tianlin Li,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces KGACG, a framework leveraging collaborative agents to automate application-level software development, particularly transforming requirements and architectural documents into executable code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large-scale software code generation due to poor organizational structures and maintenance difficulties.

Method: The framework involves a collaborative cycle of three agents: Code Organization & Planning Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA). These agents work with feedback mechanisms for code generation and testing.

Result: A Java Tank Battle game is utilized as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the KGACG framework in automating code generation.

Conclusion: KGACG showcases potential in advancing automation in application-level software development, addressing challenges faced by previous methods through a multi-agent approach with structured collaboration and feedback loops.

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has
enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level
software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but
existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software
code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of
project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process.
To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code
Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software
requirements specification and architectural design document into executable
code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning
Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a
feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in
KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is
dedicated to advancing the automation of application-level software
development.

*Atharv Sonwane,Isadora White,Hyunji Lee,Matheus Pereira,Lucas Caccia,Minseon Kim,Zhengyan Shi,Chinmay Singh,Alessandro Sordoni,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating bugs via unintentional test failures caused by feature introductions, aiming to create more realistic training data. This approach outperforms existing bug datasets in training efficiency and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the training of language model-based software engineering agents by providing high-quality, realistic bug datasets.

Method: The method instructs SWE agents to introduce features into codebases that unintentionally break tests, generating bugs reflecting realistic development processes rather than intentionally modifying code.

Result: Generated bugs improved training efficiency, requiring only half the data compared to traditional bug datasets, and enhanced performance of FrogBoss and FrogMini models, achieving state-of-the-art results on SWE-bench Verified benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method produces realistic and diverse bugs that better represent human-authored code edits, proving superior in training language models for software engineering tasks.

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over
three seeds.

### [339] [On Interaction Effects in Greybox Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19984)
*Konstantinos Kitsios,Marcel Böhme,Alberto Bacchelli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer improving on traditional fuzzers by learning the optimal sequence of mutators for better efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of greybox fuzzers by optimizing the sequence of mutators used to generate test inputs.

Method: The study hypothesizes and demonstrates how mutator sequence impacts greybox fuzzing performance. MuoFuzz leverages a probabilistic model based on conditional probabilities of mutator pairs and uses random walks to learn and select efficient mutator sequences.

Result: MuoFuzz surpasses existing fuzzers like AFL++ and MOPT in terms of code coverage and bug-detection capabilities, discovering unique bugs missed by the others.

Conclusion: Using adaptive mutator sequence selection significantly improves greybox fuzzing performance, establishing MuoFuzz as a superior option compared to existing tools.

Abstract: A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new
test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or
deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all
coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the
order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the
effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to
a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and
indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more
efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher
likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the
most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability
that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously
selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random
walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to
AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the
selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the
FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code
coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and
MOPT.

*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents FAIGMOE, a conceptual framework for adopting Generative AI tailored for midsize organizations and enterprises, addressing challenges unique to their scale and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of specific technology adoption frameworks for implementing Generative AI in midsize and larger enterprises, which encounter distinctive challenges.

Method: The paper introduces FAIGMOE, a multi-phase conceptual framework informed by technology adoption theory, organizational change, and innovation diffusion perspectives. It focuses on strategic assessment, planning, implementation, integration, operationalization, and optimization with GenAI-focused considerations.

Result: FAIGMOE offers actionable protocols, assessment tools, and governance templates adaptable for midsize organizations and enterprises. It distinguishes itself from generic frameworks by including GenAI-specific elements such as prompt engineering and hallucination management.

Conclusion: The framework addresses a critical gap in literature by providing specific and scalable guidance for GenAI adoption, with potential impact in future empirical validation research.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative
opportunities for organizations, yet both midsize organizations and larger
enterprises face distinctive adoption challenges. Midsize organizations
encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises
struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing
technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model),
TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations)
theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these
diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper
introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI
in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing
the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology
adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion
perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning
and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and
Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on
readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical
architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and
complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including
prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that
distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective
contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework
explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise
organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment
instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through
future research.

### [341] [The Cost of Downgrading Build Systems: A Case Study of Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20041)
*Gareema Ranjan,Mahmoud Alfadel,Gengyi Sun,Shane McIntosh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance implications of downgrading from artifact-based build tools to simpler alternatives in software development. Through a case study on Kubernetes and other projects, the authors analyze performance changes in build times, memory usage, and CPU load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand the implications of downgrading from modern artifact-based build tools, which offer faster builds but are harder to maintain, to older, easier-to-maintain build systems.

Method: The authors conducted a case study on the Kubernetes project, analyzing both full and incremental builds during a downgrade from Bazel to Go Build. They reproduced builds and examined CPU, memory, and build time impacts, extending their analysis to four other projects.

Result: The study found that while artifact-based tools like Bazel provide faster builds, they demand significantly higher memory and CPU resources. Downgrading to simpler tools like Go Build often increases build times but decreases resource consumption. CI resource costs can increase substantially post-downgrade.

Conclusion: Switching away from advanced artifact-based build tools like Bazel results in notable performance trade-offs: while maintainability may be improved, large projects face significant increases in build duration and CI resource costs. Stakeholders should carefully weigh these trade-offs when selecting build tools.

Abstract: Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can
impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet
prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier
to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the
implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from
an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go
Build). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets
during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are
faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose
a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel
builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for
full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading
from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our
observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other
projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that
while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory.
We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived
maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for
large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in
build tool adoption

*Carlos J. Fernandez-Candel,Jesus Garcia-Molina,Francisco Javier Bermudez Ruiz,Jose Ramon Hoyos Barcelo,Diego Sevilla Ruiz,Benito Jose Cuesta Viera*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses a model-driven reengineering approach to migrate PL/SQL code from RAD platforms into Java using KDM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist enterprises in migrating legacy RAD platform applications, such as Oracle Forms, to modern software technologies.

Method: A software process for model-driven reengineering utilizing KDM models and a TDD-like approach for incremental transformation and validation of code.

Result: A detailed implementation and validation of the reengineering approach, along with an evaluation of challenges in applying MDE.

Conclusion: Model-driven reengineering is effective in converting legacy code, with systematic processes enhancing the migration and validation tasks.

Abstract: Model-driven software engineering (MDE) techniques are not only useful in
forward engineering scenarios, but can also be successfully applied to evolve
existing systems. RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the
nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a
large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications,
such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software
company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms
triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers.
  Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to
develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy
code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In
this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven
re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally
develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated
code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are
explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the
application of MDE.

*Zhenning Yang,Hui Guan,Victor Nicolet,Brandon Paulsen,Joey Dodds,Daniel Kroening,Ang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSync, an automated system that reconciles changes in infrastructure-as-code (IaC) systems caused by external interfaces, maintaining alignment with current infrastructure states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IaC frameworks experience infrastructure drift when used in conjunction with consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, leading to outdated configurations and errors due to lack of visibility into external changes.

Method: NSync utilizes cloud API traces, applies an agentic architecture powered by LLMs to infer intents, updates configurations, and builds a knowledge base of past reconciliations.

Result: Experiments on Terraform projects confirmed NSync's superiority, achieving higher accuracy and token efficiency in reconciliation tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: NSync effectively reduces infrastructure drift in IaC systems by leveraging cloud API data, LLMs, and automated reconciliation tools, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in infrastructure updates.

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,
cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of
choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have
quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the
infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of
automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,
or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment
with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,
or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure
drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may
undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates
out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that
infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the
lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API
traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update
the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic
architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API
sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and
continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past
reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting
realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation
performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372
drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of
accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$
improvement).

TL;DR: Classport facilitates runtime introspection of dependencies in Java, which was previously unsupported.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable runtime observation of dependencies for enhanced Software Supply Chain security in Java.

Method: The Classport system embeds dependency information directly into Java class files, making it retrievable during runtime execution.

Result: Classport was evaluated on six real-world projects, successfully demonstrating its feasibility in identifying dependencies at runtime.

Conclusion: Classport enables Java to support runtime dependency introspection, paving the way for runtime integrity checking to enhance security.

Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which
dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for
Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this
problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java
class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We
evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in
identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with
Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a secure, IP-protected distributed co-simulation approach using UniFMU, showcased through demos in varied network settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of cybersecurity and IP protection guidelines in distributed co-simulation of continuous-time or hybrid systems.

Method: Developing an enhanced co-simulation approach with cybersecurity improvements using UniFMU, ensuring client-initiated connections, and trusted platforms for models and binaries.

Result: The approach is validated through demonstrations in four network environments, highlighting the trade-offs between IP security and simulation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection while balancing efficiency in distributed co-simulation scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual
Property (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation,
there is no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of
continuous-time or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking
attacks. We propose an approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU
with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the
connection is initiated by the client and the models and binaries live on
trusted platforms. We showcase the functionality of this approach using two
co-simulation demos in four different network settings and analyze the
trade-off between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency in these
settings.

TL;DR: This paper investigates factors affecting the adoption of deductive verification by analyzing data from interviews with 30 experts from academia and industry and provides recommendations to overcome challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite its proven utility, deductive verification's adoption remains limited due to multiple barriers. The paper aims to explore these limitations and recommend solutions.

Method: Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 verification practitioners, followed by thematic data analysis to identify obstacles and enablers.

Result: The study highlighted the need for high expertise, proof maintenance challenges, lack of automation control, and usability concerns as hindrances. It identified practical enablers and developed recommendations.

Conclusion: Deductive verification holds untapped potential but requires improved usability, automation, and integration to address identified challenges and promote wider adoption.

Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system
exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and
feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a
mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study
investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive
verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from
both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data
employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar
challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal
proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof
maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We
further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers
for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for
practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for
usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.

*YingJian Xiao,RongQun Hu,WeiWei Gong,HongWei Li,AnQuan Jie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in the task of statement-level code fault localization, analyzing their performance with different models, datasets, and prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill the gap in comprehensive evaluations of LLMs for fault localization tasks, which are critical for automated program repair but often rely on the quality of upstream processes.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic empirical evaluation of both open-source and closed-source LLMs using datasets like HumanEval-Java and Defects4J, exploring various prompting strategies such as standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that adding bug report context improves performance, few-shot learning has diminishing returns, and the success of chain-of-reasoning depends on the model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed assessment of current LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in code fault localization, offering insights into strategies that can enhance their effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the
effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of
upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently
lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the
statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative
open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source
models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization
capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study
investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard
prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with
a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost
dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context
significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for
improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while
chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks,
but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and
strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.

### [349] [A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679)
*Jonas Klauke,Tom Ohlmer,Stefan Schott,Serena Elisa Ponta,Wolfram Fischer,Eric Bodden*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of software dependency bloating in projects and introduces Deblometer to evaluate debloating tools for Java. It finds existing tools have issues with balancing soundness and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of unnecessary code in software projects due to bloated dependencies, which leads to inefficiencies and potential issues during runtime.

Method: The authors developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark with 59 test cases for Java, to evaluate the soundness and precision of popular Java debloating tools by providing ground truth for necessary and bloated constructs.

Result: The evaluation of Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard using Deblometer revealed significant soundness issues in all tools, including removal of required constructs and failures with dynamic class loading.

Conclusion: Existing Java debloating tools have limitations in maintaining soundness and precision. Improving these tools is essential for more stable and reliable debloated software.

Abstract: Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as
dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36
dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of
dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies
are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain
unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development
of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs
while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by
preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off,
we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed
to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each
test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and
bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness
and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating
tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools
remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or
execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces
unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains
more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs.
JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for
annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness
issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and
reliable debloated software.

### [350] [Exploring Large Language Models for Access Control Policy Synthesis and Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20692)
*Adarsh Vatsa,Bethel Hall,William Eiers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating and analyzing access control policies, highlighting both their potential and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access control policies in cloud computing are often complex and error-prone. There is a need for automated tools to generate and analyze these policies effectively.

Method: The study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing and summarizing access control policies. It includes using LLMs for automatic policy generation and introducing a semantic-based request summarization method to analyze policies.

Result: LLMs can generate syntactically correct policies; however, their generated policies meet the specification accurately 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs and 93.7% for reasoning LLMs. A semantic-based summarization approach shows promise in analyzing existing policies.

Conclusion: While LLMs face challenges in automating policy generation, they perform well when combined with symbolic methods for policy analysis, showing potential for improving access control systems.

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted
on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to
write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to
private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to
their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often
implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to
precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated
code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be
used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in
understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of
LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we
first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding
that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,
they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given
specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time
for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze
policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach
which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests
allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles
in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results
when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.

*Aueaphum Aueawattthanaphisut,Thanyanee Srichaisak,Arissa Ieochai*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A sensor-fused wearable device for enhancing upper-limb function was successfully tested for technical feasibility in healthy volunteers, using sEMG, IMU, and machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a wearable prototype that assists upper-limb functions, incorporating advanced sensor fusion and machine learning for real-time feedback and control during functional tasks.

Method: A device combining sEMG, IMU, and flex/force sensors processes signals using filtering and feature extraction, then employs a TensorFlow Lite model to deliver commands within a safety-controlled game-based setup. It was pilot-tested with 12 healthy volunteers performing daily tasks.

Result: Feasibility tests showed reduced tremor prominence, increased range of motion, higher activity repetitions, and improved EMG characteristics. The system ran smoothly with minimal latency and zero adverse events.

Conclusion: The study proved the technical feasibility of using a wearable sensor-fused device for upper-limb assistance, paving the way for formal patient trials.

Abstract: A sensor-fused wearable assistance prototype for upper-limb function (triceps
brachii and extensor pollicis brevis) is presented. The device integrates
surface electromyography (sEMG), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and
flex/force sensors on an M5StickC plus an ESP32-S3 compute hub. Signals are
band-pass and notch filtered; features (RMS, MAV, zero-crossings, and 4-12 Hz
tremor-band power) are computed in 250 ms windows and fed to an INT8 TensorFlow
Lite Micro model. Control commands are bounded by a control-barrier-function
safety envelope and delivered within game-based tasks with lightweight
personalization. In a pilot technical feasibility evaluation with healthy
volunteers (n = 12) performing three ADL-oriented tasks, tremor prominence
decreased (Delta TI = -0.092, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.079]), range of motion
increased (+12.65%, 95% CI [+8.43, +13.89]), repetitions rose (+2.99 min^-1,
95% CI [+2.61, +3.35]), and the EMG median-frequency slope became less negative
(Delta = +0.100 Hz/min, 95% CI [+0.083, +0.127]). The sensing-to-assist loop
ran at 100 Hz with 8.7 ms median on-device latency, 100% session completion,
and 0 device-related adverse events. These results demonstrate technical
feasibility of embedded, sensor-fused assistance for upper-limb function;
formal patient studies under IRB oversight are planned.

### [352] [Enhanced Cyclic Coordinate Descent Methods for Elastic Net Penalized Linear Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19999)
*Yixiao Wang,Zishan Shao,Ting Jiang,Aditya Devarakonda*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECCD, an efficient approach for solving generalized linear models, improving training speed by 3× compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in existing state-of-the-art methods for solving generalized linear models, focusing on reducing training time while maintaining convergence and numerical stability.

Method: The ECCD framework uses a redesigned cyclic coordinate descent method with a Taylor expansion to approximate gradients, allowing unrolling of vector recurrences into batched computations for enhanced efficiency.

Result: The ECCD method achieved performance improvements averaging 3× in training time for the regularization path variant on various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ECCD provides a faster and numerically stable alternative to block coordinate descent, offering consistent improvements in solving generalized linear models; its implementation is publicly available for future use.

Abstract: We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for
solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces
training time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign
the CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to
avoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing
this approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in
the CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient
batched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled
by a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s > 1$ yields performance
improvements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original
CD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and
numerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we
implement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra
computations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art
solvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\times$ in average for
regularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/ECCD.

*Somayajulu L. N. Dhulipala,Deep Ray,Nicholas Forman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes compositional diffusion approaches for simulating coupled PDE systems using decoupled training data, achieving efficient, long-horizon modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational intensity of simulating coupled PDE systems and reduce dependency on large coupled datasets.

Method: Investigate the use of compositional diffusion models trained on decoupled data, employing strategies like v-parameterization and symmetric compositional schemes.

Result: Compositional diffusion models recover coupled trajectories with low error; v-parameterization improves performance compared to baseline diffusion models, while neural operator surrogates achieve higher accuracy when trained on coupled data.

Conclusion: Compositional diffusion approaches provide a feasible and efficient method for modeling coupled PDEs over long time horizons, even with decoupled training data.

Abstract: Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior
efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled)
data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study
compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on
the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the
coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy
can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time
steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained
using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric
compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We
evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and
benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite
seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover
coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy
over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains
strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that
compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon
modeling of coupled PDEs.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAERNN, a neural network algorithm tailored for heterogeneous censored data, emphasizing its flexibility and minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Expectile Regression Neural Networks primarily focus on fully observed data, leaving a gap in approaches for censored observations.

Method: Developing a data augmentation-based ERNN algorithm, termed DAERNN, designed for handling censored data while requiring minimal assumptions and offering flexibility.

Result: DAERNN outperforms existing censored ERNN methods and performs comparably to models trained on fully observed data through simulations and real data applications.

Conclusion: The proposed DAERNN framework effectively handles various censoring mechanisms, enhances predictive performance, and improves practical applications in censored data analysis.

Abstract: Expectile regression neural networks (ERNNs) are powerful tools for capturing
heterogeneity and complex nonlinear structures in data. However, most existing
research has primarily focused on fully observed data, with limited attention
paid to scenarios involving censored observations. In this paper, we propose a
data augmentation based ERNNs algorithm, termed DAERNN, for modeling
heterogeneous censored data. The proposed DAERNN is fully data driven, requires
minimal assumptions, and offers substantial flexibility. Simulation studies and
real data applications demonstrate that DAERNN outperforms existing censored
ERNNs methods and achieves predictive performance comparable to models trained
on fully observed data. Moreover, the algorithm provides a unified framework
for handling various censoring mechanisms without requiring explicit parametric
model specification, thereby enhancing its applicability to practical censored
data analysis.

*Lucas Darius Konrad,Nikolas Kuschnig*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formal framework for identifying and statistically assessing overly influential data subsets in modeling outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of a formal theory to identify whether overly influential data points represent genuine issues or natural variations.

Method: Theoretical results are developed describing extreme value distributions of maximal influence, complemented by rigorous hypothesis testing.

Result: The framework demonstrates its value by application across economics, biology, and machine learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: A principled approach for statistical significance evaluation of influential subsets is proposed, improving beyond current sensitivity checks.

Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can
have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes
overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify
these \emph{most influential sets}, no formal theory exists to determine when
their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling
variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for
assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our
theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal
influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence,
replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value
of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine
learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized framework for multi-robot exploration under Lunar Delay-Tolerant Network constraints, utilizing a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the issue of data relay for autonomous rovers exploring under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility, which challenges traditional routing methods.

Method: The method involves framing the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP) and applying a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (GAT-MARL) approach using Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE).

Result: The proposed GAT-MARL method achieves higher delivery rates, avoids data duplications, lowers packet loss, and efficiently uses mobility forecasts compared to traditional methods, demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations and successful scaling with larger rover teams.

Conclusion: The GAT-MARL framework provides a scalable and efficient solution for autonomous multi-robot exploration under Lunar Delay-Tolerant Network conditions and shows potential applicability in planetary exploration scenarios.

Abstract: We present a fully decentralized routing framework for multi-robot
exploration missions operating under the constraints of a Lunar Delay-Tolerant
Network (LDTN). In this setting, autonomous rovers must relay collected data to
a lander under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns. We
formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)
and propose a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(GAT-MARL) policy that performs Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
(CTDE). Our method relies only on local observations and does not require
global topology updates or packet replication, unlike classical approaches such
as shortest path and controlled flooding-based algorithms. Through Monte Carlo
simulations in randomized exploration environments, GAT-MARL provides higher
delivery rates, no duplications, and fewer packet losses, and is able to
leverage short-term mobility forecasts; offering a scalable solution for future
space robotic systems for planetary exploration, as demonstrated by successful
generalization to larger rover teams.

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical foundations of SMOTE and its variants for synthesizing minority data in imbalanced classification problems and provides theoretical risk bounds and guidelines for parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in theoretical understanding of SMOTE and offer a basis to better understand its impact on classification problems.

Method: The paper develops a theoretical framework analyzing the behavior of SMOTE using uniform concentration bounds and nonparametric excess risk guarantees for kernel-based classifiers.

Result: The study provides theoretical risk bounds and insights that translate into improved parameter tuning recommendations for SMOTE and downstream classifiers.

Conclusion: The findings refine understanding of SMOTE, contribute to its theoretical foundation, and offer practical guidelines for its application in imbalanced classification tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic oversampling of minority examples using SMOTE and its variants is a
leading strategy for addressing imbalanced classification problems. Despite the
success of this approach in practice, its theoretical foundations remain
underexplored. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the behavior of
SMOTE and related methods when classifiers are trained on synthetic data. We
first derive a uniform concentration bound on the discrepancy between the
empirical risk over synthetic minority samples and the population risk on the
true minority distribution. We then provide a nonparametric excess risk
guarantee for kernel-based classifiers trained using such synthetic data. These
results lead to practical guidelines for better parameter tuning of both SMOTE
and the downstream learning algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided to
illustrate and support the theoretical findings

### [358] [Diffusion Autoencoders with Perceivers for Long, Irregular and Multimodal Astronomical Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20595)
*Yunyi Shen,Alexander Gagliano*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep), a self-supervised learning framework designed for scientific data with irregular, heterogeneous sequences, showing superior performance over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-supervised architectures are mainly validated on regularly-sampled data like images and videos, whereas there is a need for representation learning methods tailored for scientific data, which is often irregular, heterogeneous, and arrives as long sequences.

Method: The authors propose the daep model, which tokenizes heterogeneous data, compresses it with a Perceiver encoder, and reconstructs it using a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder. They also benchmark the architecture against a masked autoencoder adjusted to a Perceiver design, creating a comparative baseline named maep.

Result: The daep model demonstrates lower reconstruction errors, generates more discriminative latent spaces, and preserves fine-scale structures better than both the VAE and maep baselines across spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets.

Conclusion: The study establishes that daep is a powerful and effective framework for handling irregular and multimodal scientific data, outperforming existing models in such scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation
learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only
been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos.
In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and
multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we
introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes
heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and
reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable
learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt
the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a
strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse
spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower
reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better
preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results
establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data
arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper evaluates inference-time improvement strategies for LLMs, such as self-reflection and budget tuning, across different tasks and domains, analyzing trade-offs between accuracy, cost, and latency. Key results show domain-specific variation in effectiveness and provide actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need viable approaches to improve Large Language Models' inference-time performance, especially without retraining, amidst diverse domain-specific challenges and trade-offs between multiple factors like cost and accuracy.

Method: A systematic comparison of self-reflection and budget tuning techniques was conducted across mathematical reasoning and translation tasks, using various LLMs and analyzing dependencies like reflection depth and feedback mechanism quality. Performance frontiers were derived.

Result: Performance gains of up to 220% were observed in mathematical reasoning, along with domain-dependent variations in self-reflection. Market-dependent effectiveness in a deployed localization system emphasized the need for domain-specific evaluations.

Conclusion: Domain-specific evaluation is crucial for optimizing inference strategies in LLMs. The findings present actionable guidance for applying self-reflection and budget tuning effectively under resource constraints and task requirements.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face
increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model
retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like
self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create
complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly
understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares
self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation
tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and
Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and
compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis
reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection
effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We
further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality
influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a
real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content
localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent
effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when
deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for
selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource
constraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for

Motivation: The paper addresses the dual challenge of the shift towards O-RAN architecture and the threat posed by quantum computing, which jeopardizes current cryptographic systems.

Method: The authors propose Q-RAN—a framework deploying NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) with protocols like PQ-IPsec and PQ-DTLS, integrated with Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) and managed under a Post-Quantum Certificate Authority.

Result: Q-RAN provides a detailed roadmap to secure O-RAN ecosystems and mitigates the threat of quantum computers breaking current cryptographic protocols.

Conclusion: The framework ensures a comprehensive quantum-resistant security solution for O-RAN setups, protecting against threats like HNDL strategies and securing future telecommunications.

Abstract: The telecommunications industry faces a dual transformation: the
architectural shift toward Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) and the emerging
threat from quantum computing. O-RAN disaggregated, multi-vendor architecture
creates a larger attack surface vulnerable to crypt-analytically relevant
quantum computers(CRQCs) that will break current public key cryptography. The
Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) attack strategy makes this threat immediate,
as adversaries can intercept encrypted data today for future decryption. This
paper presents Q-RAN, a comprehensive quantum-resistant security framework for
O-RAN networks using NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). We
detail the implementation of ML-KEM (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA (FIPS 204),
integrated with Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) for cryptographic
entropy. The solution deploys PQ-IPsec, PQ-DTLS, and PQ-mTLS protocols across
all O-RAN interfaces, anchored by a centralized Post-Quantum Certificate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of current 5G cryptographic systems (e.g., RSA, ECC, DH) to quantum computing attacks, particularly those enabled by Shor's algorithm.

Method: The authors propose QORE, a framework utilizing NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms (ML-KEM and ML-DSA) and Hybrid PQC configurations for 5G networks, ensuring compatibility and smooth transitions during the migration.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates the quantum security of ML-KEM with minimal performance overhead, meeting the technical needs of 5G systems, including low-latency and high-throughput.

Conclusion: QORE provides a structured pathway for adopting PQC within 5G networks, supports ongoing international standardization efforts, and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of network data in the quantum era.

Abstract: Quantum computing is reshaping the security landscape of modern
telecommunications. The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G
systems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman
(DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G
networks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent
engineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a
quantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear
pathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment
(UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the
NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation
Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and
applies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC
(HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe
primitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental
validation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance
overhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of
carrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and
SA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as
well as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for
mitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and
integrity of network data.

Motivation: Privacy-preserving machine learning faces challenges of secure computation in untrusted environments, with significant overhead from Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The paper aims to address the inefficiency of FHE for edge devices by proposing a hybrid solution.

Method: The authors propose a Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) framework combined with an efficient symmetric cipher designed for FHE compatibility. This architecture is implemented as a hardware accelerator with microarchitectural optimizations.

Result: Experiments on a PYNQ-Z2 platform with MNIST dataset show over 50x reduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly 2x improvement in hardware throughput compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of hardware-accelerated HHE for low-power edge deployment, presenting a scalable hardware-software co-design methodology for secure machine learning in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is an emerging topic to handle
secure machine learning inference over sensitive data in untrusted
environments. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation directly
on encrypted data on the server side, making it a promising approach for PPML.
However, it introduces significant communication and computation overhead on
the client side, making it impractical for edge devices. Hybrid homomorphic
encryption (HHE) addresses this limitation by combining symmetric encryption
(SE) with FHE to reduce the computational cost on the client side, and
combining with an FHE-friendly SE can also lessen the processing overhead on
the server side, making it a more balanced and efficient alternative. Our work
proposes a hardware-accelerated HHE architecture built around a lightweight
symmetric cipher optimized for FHE compatibility and implemented as a dedicated
hardware accelerator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design to
integrate an end-to-end HHE framework with hardware acceleration. Beyond this,
we also present several microarchitectural optimizations to achieve higher
performance and energy efficiency. The proposed work is integrated into a full
PPML pipeline, enabling secure inference with significantly lower latency and
power consumption than software implementations. Our contributions validate the
feasibility of low-power, hardware- accelerated HHE for edge deployment and
provide a hardware- software co-design methodology for building scalable,
secure machine learning systems in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on a PYNQ-Z2 platform with the MNIST dataset show over a 50x
reduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly a 2x gain in hardware
throughput compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators.

*Nitin Awathare*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reveals vulnerabilities in current HTLC solutions, introduces a stronger attack, and proposes a new secure protocol called \prot to address these issues effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities and security concerns in state-of-the-art Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), particularly their susceptibility to bribery attacks and incentive incompatibility.

Method: The authors expose vulnerabilities in current HTLC protocols using a miner-collusion bribery attack, provide its implementation and game-theoretic analysis, and introduce \prot, a two-phase HTLC protocol designed to resist all bribery scenarios.

Result: The authors demonstrate that \prot is resistant to all identified bribery scenarios and achieves better efficiency in transaction cost and latency through implementation on Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that \prot is a game-theoretically secure solution to the vulnerabilities in current HTLC protocols, offering robust defense against bribery attacks while ensuring efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) because of
their use in wide areas of applications such as payment channels, atomic swaps,
etc, their use in exchange is still questionable. This is because of its
incentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.
  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC
(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to
mitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;
however, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they
consider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the
transfer collude with the miner.
  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by
presenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and
game-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC
than He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking
naive HTLC.
  Leveraging our insights, we propose \prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC
protocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \prot\ employs a two-phase
approach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as
miners. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is
executed without manipulation. We demonstrate \prot's efficiency in transaction
cost and latency via implementations on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### [365] [Policy-Governed RAG - Research Design Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19877)
*Jean-Marie Le Ray*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper outlines a policy-governed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for audit-ready, regulation-compliant outputs, emphasizing cryptographic evidence, adherence to policies, and proof of compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for audit-ready, regulation-compliant architectures in domains where mistakes are highly costly, and compliance is strictly mandated by regulations like the EU AI Act.

Method: The proposed tripartite architecture includes: (I) legal and policy control (SHRDLU-like), (II) cryptographic anchoring of source evidence (Memex-like), and (III) portable proofs of compliance for auditors (Xanadu-like). Outputs are governed by ex-ante policy checks and evidence binding, with measures to ensure adherence and verifiability.

Result: Initial unvalidated targets include a 20% reduction in confident errors, p95 latency of <= 900ms, and <= 2.2x serve cost. A pre-registered pilot with NO-GO gates for evaluation is planned.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG framework ensures outputs are auditable, replayable, and backed by evidence, targeting mission-critical regulated fields like finance and healthcare with commitments to compliance and transparency.

Abstract: A policy-governed RAG architecture is specified for audit-ready generation in
regulated workflows, organized as a triptych: (I) Contracts/Control
(SHRDLU-like), which governs output adherence to legal and internal policies;
(II) Manifests/Trails (Memex-like), which cryptographically anchors all cited
source evidence to ensure verifiable provenance; and (III)
Receipts/Verification (Xanadu-like), which provides the final, portable proof
of compliance for auditors (portable COSE/JOSE) (see Section 4 and Appendix A).
Rather than explaining model internals, outputs are gated ex-ante and bound to
cryptographically verifiable evidence for each material answer. Unvalidated
targets are stated (>=20% relative reduction in confident errors; p95 latency
<= 900 ms; <= 2.2x serve cost) together with a pre-registered (optional) pilot
using NO-GO gates. The design complements existing RAG/guardrails by making
policy checks auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. Target domains include
back-office compliance in pharma, medical devices, finance, legal, and the
public sector where error costs may exceed thousands of euros and audit trails
are mandatory under regulations such as the EU AI Act. Future evaluations may
pre-commit to publishing negative results when any example NO-GO gate is not
met.

*Tushar Nayan,Ziqi Zhang,Ruimin Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SecureInfer, a hybrid framework combining TEEs and GPUs to protect large language models (LLMs) against extraction attacks without greatly compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of LLMs in edge and mobile platforms makes privacy preservation crucial, especially against model extraction attacks. Achieving protection without performance loss on untrusted AI accelerators is a critical challenge.

Method: SecureInfer uses a partitioning strategy based on information-theoretic and threat-informed principles. Privacy-critical components are handled in SGX enclaves, while computationally intensive linear operations are encrypted and executed on GPUs, then securely restored in the enclaves.

Result: The prototype implementation of SecureInfer using LLaMA-2 demonstrated strong security guarantees while maintaining reasonable performance in secure on-device model inference.

Conclusion: SecureInfer is a practical solution that strikes a balance between privacy and performance for LLMs, securing against extraction attacks in mobile and edge computing environments.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile and
edge platforms, securing them against model extraction attacks has become a
pressing concern. However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the
performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a
challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance
execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a
heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate
privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to
untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts
an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy:
security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of
attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an
SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are
performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the
enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and
evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that
SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance,
offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.

*Ronghao Ni,Aidan Z. H. Yang,Min-Chien Hsu,Nuno Sabino,Limin Jia,Ruben Martins,Darion Cassel,Kevin Cheang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of machine learning to prioritize vulnerability reports from program analysis tools. It shows that hybrid models, including LLMs and GNNs, achieve high accuracy in triaging vulnerabilities, significantly reducing manual review efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively prioritizing candidate vulnerability reports generated by program analysis tools, which are often numerous and require expensive manual reviews.

Method: The authors evaluated various ML methods, including classical models, GNNs, LLMs, and hybrid approaches on a dataset of 1,883 Node.js packages. Models were trained on data derived from a dynamic program analysis tool's output.

Result: The best-performing large language model achieved an F1 score of 0.915, while GNNs and classical ML models recorded an F1 of 0.904. The optimized model eliminated 66.9% of benign packages with a false-negative rate under 7% and enabled highly efficient vulnerability detection.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates promising results, significantly improving vulnerability triage processes. The ability to achieve high precision while reducing manual review workload suggests strong potential for real-world application.

Abstract: Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability
reports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how
can security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true
vulnerabilities?
  This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to
prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on
Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each
containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of
machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks
(GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and
LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The
top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models
reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading
model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60
ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of
0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can
detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating
strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.

### [368] [CourtGuard: A Local, Multiagent Prompt Injection Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19844)
*Isaac Wu,Michael Maslowski*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CourtGuard, a multi-agent system designed to classify and mitigate prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks posed by prompt injection attacks on LLMs, such as data leaks, misinformation, and harmful behaviors, especially as LLMs are increasingly used in sensitive applications.

Method: CourtGuard is a locally-run multiagent system where prompts are analyzed in a court-like setting. A 'defense attorney' model argues for the prompt's innocence, a 'prosecution attorney' argues against it, and a 'judge' model determines the final decision.

Result: CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate compared to the Direct Detector, though it is generally less effective at detecting prompt injections. Its performance underscores the importance of balancing adversarial and benign scenarios in prompt classification.

Conclusion: CourtGuard demonstrates the potential of multiagent systems to defend against prompt injection attacks. Although it is not the most effective detector, its lower false positive rate makes it a significant step toward reliable defenses.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive
applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful
behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks
can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit
harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a
locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are
evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a "defense attorney"
model argues the prompt is benign, a "prosecution attorney" model argues the
prompt is a prompt injection, and a "judge" model gives the final
classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct
Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt
injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the
importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the
classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of
CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use
of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The
implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for
Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at
https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.

### [369] [Can Reasoning Models Obfuscate Reasoning? Stress-Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitorability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19851)
*Artur Zolkowski,Wen Xing,David Lindner,Florian Tramèr,Erik Jenner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study investigates whether models can obfuscate their chain-of-thought (CoT) to evade monitoring while pursuing adversarial objectives, highlighting the need for rigorous stress-testing for effective oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about deceptive behavior in misaligned models necessitate tools like CoT-based monitoring to ensure trustworthy outputs.

Method: A taxonomy of prompts was developed to elicit CoT obfuscation. Internal and external CoT were evaluated using toy tasks and realistic environments in SHADE-Arena.

Result: Results show that CoT monitoring works effectively without obfuscation but struggles under strong obfuscation pressure. Models obfuscate external CoT more than internal CoT under pressure.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring is useful for benign settings but requires stress-testing for robust deployment in adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive
behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT)
is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their
reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before
undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate
their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading
detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we
develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT
obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT
(prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments
in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and
efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation
pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading
detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their
external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT
provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires
model-specific stress-testing of monitorability.

### [370] [SAID: Empowering Large Language Models with Self-Activating Internal Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20129)
*Yulong Chen,Yadong Liu,Jiawen Zhang,Mu Li,Chao Huang,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Self-Activating Internal Defense (SAID)', a novel strategy to combat jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging their intrinsic safety mechanisms instead of using external interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense mechanisms rely on external adjustments such as input filtering or output modifications, which sacrifice generalizability and utility of LLMs while being computationally expensive. A more efficient, scalable, and intrinsic solution is needed.

Method: SAID is a training-free method employing a three-stage pipeline: intent distillation to extract intent semantics, safety prefix probing to activate internal safety capabilities, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure reliable decision-making.

Result: Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs demonstrated SAID's superiority over state-of-the-art defenses in minimizing harmful outputs, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks and minimizing computational costs.

Conclusion: Activating LLMs' intrinsic safety mechanisms using the SAID paradigm offers a more effective and scalable approach to achieving safe and reliable AI systems, without compromising their utility and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advances in safety alignment, remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks designed to circumvent protective mechanisms.
Prevailing defense strategies rely on external interventions, such as input
filtering or output modification, which often lack generalizability and
compromise model utility while incurring significant computational overhead. In
this work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating
Internal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external
correction to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's
own reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent
through a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract
core semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety
awareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs against six
advanced jailbreak attacks demonstrate that SAID substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in reducing harmful outputs. Crucially, it achieves
this while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal
computational overhead. Our work establishes that activating the intrinsic
safety mechanisms of LLMs is a more robust and scalable path toward building
safer and more reliable aligned AI systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes security challenges of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in dynamic environments, reviews adversarial attack methods, and provides an overview of robustness training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security and robustness concerns of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in security-sensitive scenarios, especially in the presence of adversarial attacks.

Method: The paper introduces a DRL framework, classifies adversarial attacks based on perturbation type and target, reviews attack methods, and systematically summarizes defense strategies such as adversarial training and robust learning.

Result: It organizes adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms for DRL, highlighting their advantages and limitations, and provides guidelines for improving DRL's robustness.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes future research needs in generalization, computational efficiency, scalability, and explainability, paving the way for more secure and robust DRL applications.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in
complex fields such as autonomous driving, intelligent manufacturing, and smart
healthcare, how to improve its security and robustness in dynamic and
changeable environments has become a core issue in current research. Especially
in the face of adversarial attacks, DRL may suffer serious performance
degradation or even make potentially dangerous decisions, so it is crucial to
ensure their stability in security-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we first
introduce the basic framework of DRL and analyze the main security challenges
faced in complex and changing environments. In addition, this paper proposes an
adversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and
attack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL
in detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space,
action space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the
attacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness
training strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training,
robust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related
defense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these
methods in improving the robustness of DRL. Finally, this paper looks into the
future research direction of DRL in adversarial environments, emphasizing the
research needs in terms of improving generalization, reducing computational
complexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability, aiming to provide
valuable references and directions for researchers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses environmental injection attacks on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) used for navigating mobile GUIs, introducing GhostEI-Bench to assess and mitigate vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks posed by environmental injection attacks on VLMs that operate in dynamic mobile environments, which could lead to privacy breaches or device compromises.

Method: The authors propose GhostEI-Bench, a dynamic Android emulator-based benchmark that systematically injects adversarial UI elements into workflows, evaluates agent performance, and uses judge-LLM for fine-grained failure analysis.

Result: Experiments reveal that current VLMs are highly vulnerable to deceptive environmental cues and fail in perception, recognition, and reasoning when encountering manipulated UIs.

Conclusion: GhostEI-Bench is a valuable tool for quantifying and mitigating environmental injection threats, guiding the development of more secure and reliable embodied agents.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents
to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic
on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app
interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector:
environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual
instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by
inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed
notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can
derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible
device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce
GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under
environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving
beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events
into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators
and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a
judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the
agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,
pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive
experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to
deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive
and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for
quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more
robust and secure embodied agents.

Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting spoofing attacks using a robust and accurate method.

Method: Development of a data generation framework to simulate spoofing attacks and training deep neural networks like LSTMs and Transformers on the generated dataset.

Result: Deep learning models, especially Transformer-inspired architectures, achieved high detection performance with an error rate as low as 0.16%.

Conclusion: Transformer-inspired models using early fusion input methods offer superior performance in detecting spoofing attacks.

network-based models for spoofing detection, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory
networks and Transformer-inspired architectures. These models are specifically
designed for online detection and are trained using the generated dataset. Our
results demonstrate that deep learning models can accurately distinguish
spoofed signals from genuine ones, achieving high detection performance. The
best results are achieved by Transformer-inspired architectures with early

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdaDoS attacks SDNs with adversarial reinforcement learning to evade detection successfully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DoS defense mechanisms struggle against adaptive AI-driven attacks in SDN environments.

Method: AdaDoS uses adversarial reinforcement learning, modeling the attack as a competitive game and framing it within a POMDP with reciprocal learning.

Result: AdaDoS generates adaptive DoS-like attack sequences, capable of evading both machine learning-based and rule-based detectors.

Conclusion: AdaDoS is a novel and impactful method showcasing the vulnerabilities of SDN to adaptive adversarial attacks driven by reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Existing defence mechanisms have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
mitigating rule-based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, leveraging predefined
signatures and static heuristics to identify and block malicious traffic.
However, the emergence of AI-driven techniques presents new challenges to SDN
security, potentially compromising the efficacy of existing defence mechanisms.
In this paper, we introduce~AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model that disrupt
network operations while evading detection by existing DoS-based detectors
through adversarial reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AdaDoS models
the problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to
obstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to
identify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting
its attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.
Additionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than
defenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov
decision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay
information between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a
novel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited
observations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who
has full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents
the first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of
adaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack
detectors.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems to poisoning attacks and introduces a defense method using source credibility algorithms like PageRank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to enhance RAG's robustness in CTI systems, as existing defenses struggle against sophisticated cyber threat actors who can imitate legitimate data formats and styles.

Method: The paper proposes leveraging source credibility algorithms, such as PageRank, to assign credibility scores to documents, promoting trusted sources and demoting malicious ones.

Result: Experiments using the MS MARCO dataset show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the authority of malicious documents while favoring trustworthy content. Initial tests on CTI documents also validate its potential.

Conclusion: Enhancing RAG defenses with source credibility algorithms improves their resilience against poisoning attacks in CTI systems, especially when dealing with emerging cyber threats.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant
architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to
poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts
as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and
sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and
stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of
modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility
algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we
demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score
to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized
MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our
algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing unsteady flow fields from sparse data is critical for engineering applications, and machine learning models show strong potential in solving this complex problem.

Method: A novel sampling method for diffusion models is introduced, guided by sparse measurements, and incorporates physics-based constraints using a conflict-free update during training.

Result: The proposed method outperforms other diffusion-based approaches in terms of reconstructing fluid structures and pixel-wise accuracy in 2D and 3D turbulent flow data.

Conclusion: Diffusion models, enhanced by physical knowledge, have significant potential in reconstructing high-fidelity flow field data, useful for advancements in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.

Abstract: The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a
challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine
learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their
ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse
conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful
in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining
noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable
of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we
introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the
reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using
the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with
available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during
training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments
on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms
other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in
pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of
diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their
application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.

Method: The authors propose an additive instrumental variable framework utilizing weighting functions, derive efficient influence functions using semiparametric theory, and employ debiased machine learning to create consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. They extend the method to various data settings such as longitudinal and dynamic treatment regimes.

Result: Successful demonstration of the proposed method through simulation studies and real-world application to the Job Training Partnership Act program data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively advances causal inference methodologies, enabling robust estimation in complex datasets using advanced statistical approaches.

Abstract: Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when
treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we
develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with
multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we
propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential
outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging
semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct
consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning.
Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative
instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed
method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job
Training Partnership Act program.

*Yuanshan Gao,Yang Bai,Yifan Cui*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes using observational data when unconfoundedness assumption fails, proposing new methods and validating them through numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome ethical and cost-related barriers in estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes, especially using observational data in scenarios where the unconfoundedness assumption is violated.

Method: The paper introduces three nonparametric identification methods, establishes semiparametric efficiency bounds, proposes a (K+1)-robust learning method, and provides results on marginal structural models for counterfactual means.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated efficiency and robustness effectiveness through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The contributions bring advancements in estimating dynamic treatment regimes under challenging conditions, enabling more precise applications in fields like medicine and marketing.

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes are sequential decision rules that adapt treatment
according to individual time-varying characteristics and outcomes to achieve
optimal effects, with applications in precision medicine, personalized
recommendations, and dynamic marketing. Estimating optimal dynamic treatment
regimes via sequential randomized trials might face costly and ethical hurdles,
often necessitating the use of historical observational data. In this work, we
utilize proximal causal inference framework for learning optimal dynamic
treatment regimes when the unconfoundedness assumption fails. Our contributions
are four-fold: (i) we propose three nonparametric identification methods for
optimal dynamic treatment regimes; (ii) we establish the semiparametric
efficiency bound for the value function of a given regime; (iii) we propose a
(K+1)-robust method for learning optimal dynamic treatment regimes, where K is
the number of stages; (iv) as a by-product for marginal structural models, we
establish identification and estimation of counterfactual means under a static
regime. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and multiple robustness
of our proposed methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces improved random search algorithms and a statistical framework for vine copula structure learning, addressing the limitations of the standard greedy approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the suboptimality of existing structure learning heuristics, such as Dissmann's greedy algorithm, in multivariate dependence modeling with vine copulas.

Method: Development of random search algorithms and a statistical framework based on model confidence sets, enabling better structure learning and ensemble modeling.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methodologies enhance the accuracy and flexibility of vine copula structure learning, with theoretical guarantees and superior performance in practice.

Abstract: Vine copulas offer flexible multivariate dependence modeling and have become
widely used in machine learning, yet structure learning remains a key
challenge. Early heuristics like the greedy algorithm of Dissmann are still
considered the gold standard, but often suboptimal. We propose random search
algorithms that improve structure selection and a statistical framework based
on model confidence sets, which provides theoretical guarantees on selection
probabilities and a powerful foundation for ensembling. Empirical results on
several real-world data sets show that our methods consistently outperform
state-of-the-art approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the classification accuracy for early modern religious images for research in art history and digital humanities.

Method: Combining LLM-generated descriptions from full-page book contexts with RAG-supported hybrid vector search for classification based on Iconclass codes.

Result: Achieved a classification precision of 87% and 92% at five and four levels, surpassing traditional methods.

Conclusion: The paper showcases the effectiveness of combining interdisciplinary methods using LLMs and RAG, providing a significant advancement in analyzing early modern visual archives.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of

*Mahtab Movaheddrad,Laurence Palmer,C. -C. Jay Kuo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GUSL-Dehaze proposes a new image dehazing technique that combines physics-based modeling and a lightweight green learning framework, avoiding deep learning while maintaining high performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the heavy computational costs and large parameter sizes of deep learning-based image dehazing methods, making them unsuitable for devices with limited resources.

Method: A Green U-Shaped Learning (GUSL) approach integrates a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP) with unsupervised representation learning and feature-engineering techniques to provide lightweight and efficient image dehazing without deep learning.

Result: GUSL-Dehaze achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models with significantly reduced parameter size, high interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective and transparent alternative to deep learning for image dehazing, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices while maintaining top performance.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method leveraging satellite imagery through multi-resolution analysis and deep learning to improve tropical cyclone intensity forecasting within a 24-hour lead time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving accuracy in short-term forecasting of tropical cyclone intensity for disaster mitigation, especially as TCs are often far from land-based observing networks.

Method: Utilizes discrete wavelet transform-based multi-resolution analysis to quantify TC structures and integrates deep learning techniques to guide short-term forecasting.

Result: Demonstrated strong correlation between fine TC structural features and rapid intensity changes, supporting the use of this method for predictive modeling.

Conclusion: Wavelet-based analysis combined with deep learning provides an interpretable and effective framework for improving TC intensity prediction.

Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) short-term intensity forecasting with a
24-hour lead time is essential for disaster mitigation in the Atlantic TC
basin. Since most TCs evolve far from land-based observing networks, satellite
imagery is critical to monitoring these storms; however, these complex and
high-resolution spatial structures can be challenging to qualitatively
interpret in real time by forecasters. Here we propose a concise,
interpretable, and descriptive approach to quantify fine TC structures with a
multi-resolution analysis (MRA) by the discrete wavelet transform, enabling
data analysts to identify physically meaningful structural features that
strongly correlate with rapid intensity change. Furthermore, deep-learning
techniques can build on this MRA for short-term intensity guidance.

TL;DR: This paper aims to understand how different user characteristics predict responses to moderation interventions on Reddit by analyzing various features and their informativeness in changes in activity, toxicity, and participation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective and user-centred moderation strategies, the authors aim to better understand the impact of moderation interventions by identifying user characteristics associated with behavioural changes.

Method: They study 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic, relational, and psychological features using a greedy feature selection strategy and a quantification approach to predict behavioural changes of 16.8K Reddit users after a moderation intervention.

Result: They identified key features consistently informative across tasks, determined which features are task-specific or limited in utility, and found that predicting activity and toxicity changes is easier than diversity changes.

Conclusion: The findings enable building accurate systems for predicting user reactions to moderation, emphasizing that moderation strategies should align with both user traits and intervention objectives.

Abstract: Accurately estimating how users respond to moderation interventions is
paramount for developing effective and user-centred moderation strategies.
However, this requires a clear understanding of which user characteristics are
associated with different behavioural responses, which is the goal of this
work. We investigate the informativeness of 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic,
relational, and psychological features, in predicting the behavioural changes
of 16.8K users affected by a major moderation intervention on Reddit. To reach
this goal, we frame the problem in terms of "quantification", a task
well-suited to estimating shifts in aggregate user behaviour. We then apply a
greedy feature selection strategy with the double goal of (i) identifying the
features that are most predictive of changes in user activity, toxicity, and
participation diversity, and (ii) estimating their importance. Our results
allow identifying a small set of features that are consistently informative
across all tasks, and determining that many others are either task-specific or
of limited utility altogether. We also find that predictive performance varies
according to the task, with changes in activity and toxicity being easier to
estimate than changes in diversity. Overall, our results pave the way for the
development of accurate systems that predict user reactions to moderation
interventions. Furthermore, our findings highlight the complexity of
post-moderation user behaviour, and indicate that effective moderation should
be tailored not only to user traits but also to the specific objective of the
intervention.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper highlights the importance of adversarial evaluation to address AI risks and introduces a cooperative public AI red-teaming exercise as an innovative approach to mitigate potential harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems present risks and benefits, but existing evaluation methods are unable to fully address emerging challenges, especially in high-stakes sectors such as healthcare and education.

Method: The paper proposes a cooperative public AI red-teaming exercise and evaluates its effectiveness through pilot implementations with organizations such as CAMLIS, NIST, and IMDA.

Result: The exercises demonstrated meaningful results in assessing risks and vulnerabilities of AI systems, proving the approach to be scalable across various jurisdictions.

Conclusion: Cooperative public AI red-teaming exercises offer a promising method to achieve responsible AI by addressing the "responsibility gap" and ensuring thorough evaluation of AI risks.

Abstract: AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without
rigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess
the breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of
systems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation
and red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and
other documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI
systems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare,
and intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are
proving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.
  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are
fully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new
approaches to close this "responsibility gap" are now more urgent than ever. In
this paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming
exercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This
approach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public
demonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the
operational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI
(ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the
Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue
that this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also
scalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.

*Yogesh Simmhan,Varad Kulkarni*

TL;DR: This paper discusses the implementation of an AI-based educational agent as the primary instructor in a graduate-level Cloud Computing course, highlighting early findings on its student interaction and engagement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agents into higher education to facilitate scalable, high-quality instruction while evaluating their impact on student engagement and reflective learning.

Method: The paper introduces a pedagogical framework where an AI-based Instructor Agent handles content delivery while a human instructor provides structure. An analytical framework assesses student-AI interaction through metrics like topic coverage, depth, and elaboration.

Result: Early results show that students interact with the AI agent to explore concepts, clarify doubts, and engage in inquiry-driven dialogue. Patterns demonstrate a progression from broad exploration to focused inquiry during instructional modules.

Conclusion: Structured integration of conversational AI agents in classrooms can enhance reflective learning, provide scalable educational solutions, and aid in studying engagement systematically in educational settings.

Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating
an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a
graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc. We detail the design of a Large
Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical
framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for
actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by
the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake
question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that
evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable
engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration.
We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore
concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live
classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation
metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals
patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual
exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured
integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a
reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom
settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.

*Amanda Wasielewski*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper reconsiders W.J.T. Mitchell's idea of 'picture agency' in the context of AI-generated images, arguing that these images push for specificity due to their intrinsic abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how contemporary AI image generation tools reshape the notion of agency in pictures, particularly regarding their desires and impact as entities.

Method: The author uses art historical discourse on abstraction and examines multimodal text-to-image models to reinterpret visual and textual interchangeability.

Result: AI-generated images are shown to desire specificity and concreteness, revealing gaps in the transformation between textual input and visual output.

Conclusion: AI-generated images, despite seeming concrete, are deeply abstract, and their underlying mechanics reveal the complexities of their creation, representation, and perceived agency.

Abstract: W.J.T. Mitchell's influential essay 'What do pictures want?' shifts the
theoretical focus away from the interpretative act of understanding pictures
and from the motivations of the humans who create them to the possibility that
the picture itself is an entity with agency and wants. In this article, I
reframe Mitchell's question in light of contemporary AI image generation tools
to ask: what do AI-generated images want? Drawing from art historical discourse
on the nature of abstraction, I argue that AI-generated images want specificity
and concreteness because they are fundamentally abstract. Multimodal
text-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based
on the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens
and that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented
mathematically in data. The user pipeline that sees textual input become visual
output, however, obscures this representational regress and makes it seem like
one form transforms into the other -- as if by magic.

*Wenjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper highlights the systemic risk of 'Black Box Absorption' in Large Language Models (LLMs), where user ideas can be internalized and repurposed by opaque LLM architectures, jeopardizing innovation sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent risks in the innovation ecosystem posed by LLMs absorbing and repurposing user-contributed concepts unknowingly.

Method: Two key concepts were introduced: 'idea unit' for innovation logic and 'idea safety' for protecting these contributions. Governance and engineering proposals were discussed to address absorption risks.

Result: Mechanisms of absorption were analyzed, and actionable governance and engineering agendas were proposed to mitigate risks, ensuring equitable handling of user ideas.

Conclusion: Effective traceability, control, and equity in the use of user-contributed ideas in LLMs are crucial for sustaining a balanced innovation ecosystem.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for
accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk
inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the
process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often
operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and
repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This
mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation
economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between
individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term
sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we
introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable
functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard
for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and
proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks,
ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and
equitable.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-Stack, a framework for optimizing both system performance and content generation quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complex challenge of jointly optimizing system performance and generation quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Method: The paper proposes RAG-Stack, which consists of three components: 1) RAG-IR, an intermediate representation for abstraction, 2) RAG-CM, a cost model for performance estimation, and 3) RAG-PE, an exploration algorithm for configurations.

Result: RAG-Stack provides a structured approach to balance and optimize quality and performance in RAG systems, addressing the intricate challenges in these pipelines.

Conclusion: The authors anticipate RAG-Stack to become a standard paradigm for optimizing quality and performance in RAG systems, contributing advancements to the field.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent
applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a
database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more
reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive
research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are
considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet
challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and
generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears
due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and
databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we
present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance
co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an
intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple
quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system
performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that
searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this
three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG
quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines the bi-directional influence of LLM-powered chatbots with users during discussions on controversial topics, focusing on stance changes and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and analyze how human opinions shift during interactions with LLM-powered chatbots and vice versa, especially in multi-turn conversational settings.

Method: Conducted 50 discussions on controversial topics with 266 participants under three different conditions: static, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot setups.

Result: Human opinions showed minimal shift while LLM outputs shifted significantly to reduce stance differences. Personalization emphasized these changes more than the standard setting.

Conclusion: Multi-turn conversations involving personal stories can enhance alignment shifts. Caution is required when designing personalized chatbots to avoid excessive over-alignment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

TL;DR: Empathic Prompting enriches AI-human conversation by integrating emotional cues into text prompts using facial expression recognition, enhancing conversational fluidity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of AI-human interactions by incorporating non-verbal emotional cues, especially in scenarios demanding empathy like healthcare and education.

Method: Utilizes a modular architecture to integrate facial expression recognition as non-verbal contextual signals into LLM conversations, with initial evaluations conducted using DeepSeek and qualitative user feedback.

Result: Preliminary evaluation with 5 participants demonstrates coherent integration of emotional cues, improving conversational fluidity and smoothness.

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting shows promise for enhancing AI interaction in emotionally sensitive domains, pointing to broader applications in fields like healthcare and education.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

Motivation: The problem tackles the computational challenge of finding an optimal clustering for graph cliques with associated costs, crucial for practical clustering and optimization applications.

Method: The authors focus on cubic correlation clustering, establishing partial optimality conditions and designing algorithms to check them, followed by numerical testing on two datasets.

Result: The algorithms developed for deciding the defined optimality conditions were implemented and their effectiveness was examined on two datasets.

Conclusion: The research contributes by identifying partial optimality conditions for a specific case of correlation clustering, along with algorithmic approaches and validation through numerical analysis.

Abstract: The higher-order correlation clustering problem for a graph $G$ and costs
associated with cliques of $G$ consists in finding a clustering of $G$ so as to
minimize the sum of the costs of those cliques whose nodes all belong to the
same cluster. To tackle this NP-hard problem in practice, local search
heuristics have been proposed and studied in the context of applications. Here,
we establish partial optimality conditions for cubic correlation clustering,
i.e., for the special case of at most 3-cliques. We define and implement
algorithms for deciding these conditions and examine their effectiveness
numerically, on two data sets.

### [394] [Extending machine learning model for implicit solvation to free energy calculations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20103)
*Rishabh Dey,Michael Brocidiacono,Kushal Koirala,Alexander Tropsha,Konstantin I. Popov*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN), a graph neural network-based implicit solvent model designed to improve free energy predictions with high accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit solvent approaches are computationally efficient but fall behind explicit methods in accuracy, restraining their applicability in precise thermodynamic calculations. Machine learning advancements provide an opportunity to enhance the precision of implicit solvent models.

Method: The LSNN is trained on both force-matching and derivatives of alchemical variables using a dataset of ~300,000 small molecules to ensure accurate and comparable solvation free energy predictions.

Result: The LSNN achieves free energy predictions comparable to explicit solvent methods and offers computational speedup, paving the way for applications in drug discovery and broader usage of machine learning-enhanced implicit solvent models.

Conclusion: The proposed LSNN methodology enhances the precision of implicit solvent models by addressing limitations in current ML-based approaches, making solvation free energy comparisons across chemical species feasible and efficient.

Abstract: The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to
model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often
falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise
thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML)
present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural
networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse
applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on
force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an
arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy
comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network
(GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network
(LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the
derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can
be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of
approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions
with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while
offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for
future applications in drug discovery.

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning framework for predicting surface texture parameters and their uncertainties in metrology, achieving high accuracy and calibrated intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of predicting surface texture parameters along with their standard uncertainties in metrology workflows, which is important for ensuring measurement reliability.

Method: The method involves a deep learning framework with quantile and heteroscedastic models, supported by conformal calibration techniques on a multi-instrument dataset.

Result: High fidelity was observed for surface parameter regressors and classifying measurement system type, with notable issues in predicting RONt_uncert. Single-target models outperformed multi-output models.

Conclusion: The framework delivers calibrated predictions that can guide instrument selection and acceptance decisions in metrological workflows.

Abstract: A reproducible deep learning framework is presented for surface metrology to
predict surface texture parameters together with their reported standard
uncertainties. Using a multi-instrument dataset spanning tactile and optical
systems, measurement system type classification is addressed alongside
coordinated regression of Ra, Rz, RONt and their uncertainty targets
(Ra_uncert, Rz_uncert, RONt_uncert). Uncertainty is modelled via quantile and
heteroscedastic heads with post-hoc conformal calibration to yield calibrated
intervals. On a held-out set, high fidelity was achieved by single-target
regressors (R2: Ra 0.9824, Rz 0.9847, RONt 0.9918), with two uncertainty
targets also well modelled (Ra_uncert 0.9899, Rz_uncert 0.9955); RONt_uncert
remained difficult (R2 0.4934). The classifier reached 92.85% accuracy and
probability calibration was essentially unchanged after temperature scaling
(ECE 0.00504 -> 0.00503 on the test split). Negative transfer was observed for
naive multi-output trunks, with single-target models performing better. These
results provide calibrated predictions suitable to inform instrument selection
and acceptance decisions in metrological workflows.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved method to rank time-series complexity using conditional differential entropy and prediction error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of efficiently computing conditional differential entropy for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions to measure time-series complexity.

Method: The authors leverage the information theoretic prediction error bounds and enhance them using Hadamard's inequality and the properties of covariance matrices. They conducted synthetic experiments with linear autoregressive processes and bio-inspired synthetic audio data to validate their approach.

Result: The proposed method successfully demonstrated its ability to rank time-series complexity in synthetic experiments. It showed that prediction errors can serve as proxies for entropy and recover known complexity orderings.

Conclusion: This research provides a theoretically grounded and computationally practical framework for ranking time-series complexity using prediction error bounds derived from next-step prediction models.

Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively
ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future
observations given past context. However, its direct computation for
high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable.
This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds
established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the
conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is
upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of
next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this
theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's
inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we
conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive
processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares
prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive
noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data
with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to
recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series
complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models,
that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a safer, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments, addressing challenges in EEG signal decoding accuracy and latency.

Method: A dataset was collected using 32-channel EEG from participants performing imagined handwriting. Signals were preprocessed, and various features were extracted. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, combining Temporal Convolutional Network and multilayer perceptron, was developed for neural decoding.

Result: EEdGeNet achieved 89.83% accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency; optimizing with ten key features reduced latency to 202.6 ms with less than 1% accuracy loss, enabling high-performance, portable BCIs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a method for accurate, portable, and low-latency EEG-based BCI systems, paving the way for scalable, real-time communication devices for disabled individuals.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for
individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting
provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging
the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive
approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their
surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding
precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with
informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling
real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel
EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined
handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact
subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and
graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a
Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the
extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved
89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten
key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent
loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency,
and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient and accurate detection in MIMO systems amidst high-order modulation and coding schemes in 5G networks.

Method: AttDet uses a Transformer-inspired approach where each transmit layer is treated as a token. It employs self-attention mechanisms that leverage the channel matrix to identify correlations, refining outputs iteratively.

Result: AttDet achieves near-optimal BER/BLER performance with polynomial computational complexity in realistic 5G channel simulations.

Conclusion: The synergy of model-based and data-driven methods in AttDet provides a promising solution for MIMO detection, balancing performance and complexity. This makes it suitable for practical implementations in high-performing 5G networks.

Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple
Output) detection method that treats each transmit layer as a token and learns
inter-stream interference via a lightweight self-attention mechanism. Queries
and keys are derived directly from the estimated channel matrix, so attention
scores quantify channel correlation. Values are initialized by matched-filter
outputs and iteratively refined. The AttDet design combines model-based
interpretability with data-driven flexibility. We demonstrate through
link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models and high-order, mixed
QAM modulation and coding schemes, that AttDet can approach near-optimal
BER/BLER (Bit Error Rate/Block Error Rate) performance while maintaining
predictable, polynomial complexity.

*Cesare Miglioli,Jordan Awan*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper innovatively approaches U-statistics using hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs, providing efficient algorithms and addressing challenges like high computational cost and degenerate asymptotic behavior, with applications in kernel-based tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U-statistics are crucial but face issues like high computational costs and non-standard asymptotic behavior in degenerate cases. Efficient methods are needed to improve their application in hypothesis testing.

Method: The authors employ hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs to bypass traditional methods, derive Berry-Esseen bounds, establish conditions for Gaussian distributions, and introduce efficient construction algorithms for incomplete U-statistics.

Result: Efficient algorithms for equireplicate designs are developed, along with a framework that retains statistical power while substantially reducing computational costs, demonstrated in CIFAR-10 kernel-based tests.

Conclusion: This framework advances U-statistic methodology, ensuring robust statistical outcomes while improving computational performance, with impactful applications in real-world data analysis.

Abstract: U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample
mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively
studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high
computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and
their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically
requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel
perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial
designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the
main analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy.
By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a
Berry-Esseen bound that applies to all incomplete U-statistics of deterministic
designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be
established even in the degenerate case and when the order diverges. We also
introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of
equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain
cases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to
kernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion. In a real data example with CIFAR-10, our
permutation-free MMD test delivers substantial computational gains while
retaining power and type I error control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to theoretically analyze the signal recovery limitations and performance gaps of Partial Least Squares (PLS) in multi-modal learning scenarios.

Method: The study examines cross-covariance models using random matrix theory and determines phase transition thresholds for signal recovery using a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type framework.

Result: The paper reveals that PLS exhibits fundamental performance limitations in recovering signals under specific SNR and correlation regimes, with significant gaps compared to Bayes-optimal estimators.

Conclusion: The analysis contributes to understanding the theoretical limits of PLS in high-dimensional regimes and highlights areas to improve multi-modal inference methods.

Abstract: We provide a rigorous random matrix theory analysis of spiked
cross-covariance models where the signals across two high-dimensional data
channels are partially aligned. These models are motivated by multi-modal
learning and form the standard generative setting underlying Partial Least
Squares (PLS), a widely used yet theoretically underdeveloped method. We show
that the leading singular values of the sample cross-covariance matrix undergo
a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type phase transition, and we characterize the
precise thresholds for the emergence of informative components. Our results
yield the first sharp asymptotic description of the signal recovery
capabilities of PLS in this setting, revealing a fundamental performance gap
between PLS and the Bayes-optimal estimator. In particular, we identify the SNR
and correlation regimes where PLS fails to recover any signal, despite
detectability being possible in principle. These findings clarify the
theoretical limits of PLS and provide guidance for the design of reliable
multi-modal inference methods in high dimensions.

TL;DR: This study examines stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle through a Fourier coefficient approach, describing local bifurcations, phase transitions, and metastable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations using Fourier methods, enabling insights into bifurcations, phase behaviors, and metastability.

Method: The paper links stationary solutions to an infinite-dimensional quadratic Fourier system, providing analytic tools for bifurcation analysis, free energy regularity, and phase transition characterization.

Result: The authors derive expressions for bifurcations, establish free energy properties, characterize stationary solutions, and apply results to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, analyzing its phase transitions.

Conclusion: This framework reveals detailed insights into stationary solutions' structure, bifurcation forms, and phase behavior, offering a deeper understanding of McKean-Vlasov dynamics and potential applications in complex models.

Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our
main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions
of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic
system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit
characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a
function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local
bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while
accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that
characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical,
subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple
Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also
characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the
stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of
Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity
properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and
coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying
discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the
minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the
Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many
bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$
can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which
can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous
to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately evaluate organizational efficiency across multiple dimensions, incorporating both desirable and undesirable outputs, and addressing limitations in conventional benchmarking methods.

Method: Two regularized DEA models (SBM and GP-SBM) are developed. SBM calculates an aggregate efficiency score, then distributes it across dimensions, while GP-SBM first calculates dimension-specific efficiencies before aggregating.

Result: Applying the models to a case of 12 Ontario hospitals over a 24-month period, the authors demonstrated that the proposed models outperform traditional methods by yielding more accurate correlations and integration of various input/output variables.

Conclusion: The proposed DEA models, SBM and GP-SBM, provide a comprehensive and efficient framework for evaluating and aggregating organizational efficiencies across multiple dimensions in various large-scale settings.

Abstract: We propose an approach for dynamic efficiency evaluation across multiple
organizational dimensions using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The method
generates both dimension-specific and aggregate efficiency scores, incorporates
desirable and undesirable outputs, and is suitable for large-scale problem
settings. Two regularized DEA models are introduced: a slack-based measure
(SBM) and a linearized version of a nonlinear goal programming model (GP-SBM).
While SBM estimates an aggregate efficiency score and then distributes it
across dimensions, GP-SBM first estimates dimension-level efficiencies and then
derives an aggregate score. Both models utilize a regularization parameter to
enhance discriminatory power while also directly integrating both desirable and
undesirable outputs. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and validity
of our approach on multiple datasets and apply it to a case study of twelve
hospitals in Ontario, Canada, evaluating three theoretically grounded
dimensions of organizational effectiveness over a 24-month period from January
2018 to December 2019: technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient
experience. Our numerical results show that SBM and GP-SBM better capture
correlations among input/output variables and outperform conventional
benchmarking methods that separately evaluate dimensions before aggregation.

*Dena Firoozi,Anastasis Kratsios,Xuwei Yang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes using neural operators (NOs) to solve mean-field games (MFGs) more efficiently, enabling solutions for many related problems. It establishes statistical guarantees for NOs to solve unseen problems effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MFG solvers are infeasible for solving multiple related problems, such as under perturbed dynamics, utilities, or settings with continuum-parameterized agents. This necessitates a generalized and scalable approach.

Method: The authors propose training neural operators (NOs) to map problem data (i.e., dynamics and cost functionals) to equilibrium strategies for LQ MFGs on separable Hilbert spaces. The approach is supported by theoretical results on Lipschitz estimates, universal approximation with regularity, and sample-complexity bounds.

Result: The trained NOs can reliably solve unseen LQ MFG problems, including infinite-dimensional cases, with a statistically controlled parameter count using a limited set of training data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that neural operators are capable of generalizing solutions for MFG problems, particularly in complex, infinite-dimensional cases, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers operate on an instance-by-instance
basis, which becomes infeasible when many related problems must be solved
(e.g., for seeking a robust description of the solution under perturbations of
the dynamics or utilities, or in settings involving continuum-parameterized
agents.). We overcome this by training neural operators (NOs) to learn the
rules-to-equilibrium map from the problem data (``rules'': dynamics and cost
functionals) of LQ MFGs defined on separable Hilbert spaces to the
corresponding equilibrium strategy. Our main result is a statistical guarantee:
an NO trained on a small number of randomly sampled rules reliably solves
unseen LQ MFG variants, even in infinite-dimensional settings. The number of NO
parameters needed remains controlled under appropriate rule sampling during
training.
  Our guarantee follows from three results: (i) local-Lipschitz estimates for
the highly nonlinear rules-to-equilibrium map; (ii) a universal approximation
theorem using NOs with a prespecified Lipschitz regularity (unlike traditional
NO results where the NO's Lipschitz constant can diverge as the approximation
error vanishes); and (iii) new sample-complexity bounds for $L$-Lipschitz
learners in infinite dimensions, directly applicable as the Lipschitz constants
of our approximating NOs are controlled in (ii).

Abstract: Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is key to safe autonomous

This paper proposes a novel online method to accurately predict the occupancy

future occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable and sustainable energy management in microgrids as renewable energy integration increases, and to overcome the computational limitations of optimization-based approaches in real-time decision-making.

Method: A neural network is trained using imitation learning to replicate expert control actions from offline Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC). Key enhancements include noise injection during training for robustness and accounting for renewable generation and demand uncertainties.

Result: The proposed method achieves similar economic performance to EMPC while cutting computation time by 90%.

Conclusion: The imitation learning-based framework offers an effective and computationally efficient solution for microgrid energy management under uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable
microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes
an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic

### [408] [A Tutorial on Cognitive Biases in Agentic AI-Driven 6G Autonomous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19973)
*Hatim Chergui,Farhad Rezazadeh,Merouane Debbah,Christos Verikoukis*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes enhancing network autonomy in 6G through agentic AI leveraging large language model-powered agents while addressing cognitive biases introduced by human design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond KPI optimization for achieving true 6G network autonomy by focusing on seamless connectivity, fairness, adaptability, and resilience.

Method: A tutorial on cognitive biases (taxonomy, definition, formulation, emergence, mitigation strategies) affecting LLM-powered agents in 6G networks and practical use-cases with mitigation techniques like anchor randomization, temporal decay, and inflection bonus.

Result: The implementation of mitigation techniques for biases led to significant performance improvements, such as 5x lower latency and 40% higher energy savings.

Conclusion: Mitigating cognitive biases in agentic AI fosters fairer decisions, enhanced reliability, and ensures sustainable autonomy in 6G networks.

Abstract: The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization
of key performance indicators (KPIs). While KPIs have enabled automation gains
under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as
proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity,
fairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and
reasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved
through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents
perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains,
and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such
agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human
design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation.
Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of
well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical
formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic
components. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored
to each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases,
which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in
6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor
randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to
specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids
that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions
that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in
a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the
agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times
5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.

*Saber Ahmed,Natasha Crepeau,Gisel Flores,Osiano Isekenegbe,Deanna Perez,Anne Shiu*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: The paper investigates the connection between neural codes and convex sets in Euclidean space, focusing on codes with four maximal codewords and characterizing convexity through specific obstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mathematical conditions under which neural codes correspond to convex open sets, motivated by their role in biological position sensing via place cells.

Method: The authors conduct a case-by-case analysis focusing on the nerve complex of maximal codewords, considering symmetry and obstructions like 'local' and 'wheel' constraints.

Result: Out of 20 possible nerve cases, the research successfully characterizes convexity for 15 of these cases.

Conclusion: Convexity of neural codes with four maximal codewords can often be explained through the absence of obstructions, providing deeper insight into the mathematical characterization of neural codes.

Abstract: Place cells are neurons that act as biological position sensors, associated
with and firing in response to regions of an environment to situate an organism
in space. These associations are recorded in (combinatorial) neural codes,
motivating the following mathematical question: Which neural codes are
generated by a collection of convex open sets in Euclidean space? Giusti and
Itskov showed that a necessary condition for convexity is the absence of
``local obstructions." This necessary condition is, in fact, sufficient for
certain families of codes. One such family consists of all codes with up to
three maximal codewords. In this article, we investigate codes with four
maximal codewords, showing that for many such codes, convexity is characterized
by the absence of local obstructions, whereas for other such codes, convexity
is characterized by the absence of local obstructions and a second type of
obstruction, a ``wheel". Key to our analysis is a case-by-case investigation
based on the nerve complex of the set of maximal codewords of a neural code. Up
to symmetry, there are 20 possible nerves; and our results fully characterize
convexity in 15 of the 20 cases.

### [410] [Symbolic Regression and Differentiable Fits in Beyond the Standard Model Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20453)
*Shehu AbdusSalam,Steven Abel,Deaglan Bartlett,Miguel Crispim Romão*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study explores using symbolic regression (SR) to efficiently model particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) by focusing on the CMSSM, showing its efficacy in deriving accurate, analytical expressions and improving global fitting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance methods of analyzing models in particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), such as the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM), for faster and more accurate understanding of key experimental and cosmological observables.

Method: The paper employs symbolic regression (SR) to derive analytical expressions for observables such as Higgs mass, dark matter relic density, and muon magnetic moment contribution, and compares the performance with neural network regression.

Result: Symbolic regression was found to produce accurate expressions and enable global fits using differentiable methods, outperforming neural networks in robustness unless the data was heavily optimized.

Conclusion: SR proves to be a powerful tool for analyzing BSM physics models, offering advantages like speed, accuracy, and robustness over conventional sampling methods and neural networks.

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of
particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called
Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many
incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary
parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological
observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the
phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived
for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the
Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably
accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior
probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement
with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a
major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable
methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural
network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs
require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally
performant.

*Yiming Lu,Xun Wang,Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Song Wang,Haoyun Deng,Fei Liu,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces C2C, a framework that improves task-oriented communication in multi-agent systems, achieving a 40% reduction in task completion time using intelligent communication strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current lack of systematic frameworks for task-oriented communication in multi-agent LLM systems motivated the authors to create an efficient solution for improving teamwork effectiveness and reducing task complexities.

Method: The framework utilizes two key innovations: the Alignment Factor (AF) metric for quantifying task alignment and a Sequential Action Framework, combining stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions to optimize interactions.

Result: Tests on coding workflows of varying complexity and team sizes showed C2C decreased task completion time by 40%, maintained effectiveness at scale, and successfully completed all tasks compared against baseline benchmarks.

Conclusion: C2C provides a scalable and effective solution for multi-agent collaborative tasks, setting a theoretical and practical foundation for optimizing communication strategies in complex team environments.

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

*Qinyu Xu,Yuanyang Zhu,Xuefei Wu,Chunlin Chen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces QCoFr, a new value decomposition framework for MARL that captures high-order agent interactions efficiently, enhances cooperation and interpretability, and avoids combinatorial explosion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of modeling high-order interactions among agents in MARL, which are often hampered by computational complexity and lack of interpretability.

Method: The authors propose QCoFr, leveraging a continued fraction structure to model arbitrary-order agent interactions with linear complexity, and utilize a variational information bottleneck to extract latent information for estimating credits.

Result: QCoFr achieves superior performance compared to previous methods, enhances cooperation, provides interpretability, and aligns closely with theoretical expectations.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enables effective and interpretable multi-agent coordination through efficient modeling of complex interactions, establishing QCoFr as a significant advancement in MARL.

Abstract: The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective
coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order
interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the
opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose
a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning
(QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with
only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents,
thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation.
Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract
latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents
filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation
and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only
consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability
that aligns with our theoretical analysis.

### [413] [Structures generated in a multiagent system performing information fusion in peer-to-peer resource-constrained networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20469)
*Horacio Paggi,Juan A. Lara,Javier Soriano*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores holonic fusion structures for information fusion in resource-constrained environments, emphasizing adaptability and collaboration. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the shift from hierarchical information fusion methods in military applications to holonic fusion better suited for civil, dynamic environments and edge organizations.

Method: The study uses generic modeling based on a multi-agent system and demonstrates holon operations under resource constraints.

Result: The research demonstrates that holonic structures offer adaptability, autonomy, and collaboration under resource limitations (energy, messages, time).

Conclusion: Holonic structures are advantageous in environments with sudden changes, resource shortages, or system failures, enhancing information fusion under constraints.

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information
fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a
purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military
applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which
is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above
paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different
non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,
where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static
hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic
structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources
(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of
fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as
a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message
exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system
model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures
have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the
environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of
cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the
shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components
start to fail.

*Aritra Roy,Enrico Grisan,John Buckeridge,Chiara Gattinoni*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Development of ComProScanner, an advanced multi-agent platform for extracting, validating, classifying, and visualizing chemical compositions and experimental data from scientific articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of accessible automated tools for extracting and generating structured datasets from scientific literature, particularly in the realm of chemical compositions and experimental data, necessitated the creation of ComProScanner.

Method: ComProScanner employs pre-trained large language models to autonomously extract, validate, classify, and integrate scientific data from journal articles into comprehensive databases.

Result: Evaluation against 10 large language models showed DeepSeek-V3-0324 achieving a high accuracy of 0.82 for extracting complex ceramic piezoelectric material data.

Conclusion: ComProScanner simplifies the process of building datasets from scientific literature by automating extraction and visualization, with significant potential for creating high-quality inputs for machine learning and deep learning applications.

Abstract: Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting
structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary
change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language
processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that
allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific
literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an
autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation,
classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and
properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for
comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal
articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary
models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic
piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients
(d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials.
DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of
0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package
for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to
build machine learning or deep learning datasets.

Motivation: To improve methods for detecting rare gamma quanta in fluxes from universe sources amidst charged particle background.

Method: The proposed approach integrates deep learning and normalizing flows to enable anomaly detection in gamma detection applications.

Result: The method demonstrated potential for gamma detection. However, its performance is currently lower than existing techniques based on quantitative indicators.

Conclusion: While the method shows promise, enhancements are required to match or outperform existing approaches. Suggested improvements are discussed in the paper.

Abstract: The objective of this work is to develop a method for detecting rare gamma
quanta against the background of charged particles in the fluxes from sources

method designed for anomaly detection. It is shown that the suggested method
has a potential for the gamma detection. The method was tested on model data
from the TAIGA-IACT experiment. The obtained quantitative performance
indicators are still inferior to other approaches, and therefore possible ways

*Luise Ge,Gregory Kehne,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper investigates social choice theory using linear utility functions and introduces algorithms for minimizing distortion, with empirical evaluations in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address suboptimal outcomes in social choices when voters' utilities are determined via parametric functions in vector representations.

Method: The paper studies distortion through mathematical analysis, designing deterministic and randomized voting rules, and proposes algorithms to minimize distortion in polynomial time based on candidate and vote data.

Result: The paper provides distortion bounds dependent on candidate embedding dimensions and develops algorithms tested in recommendation systems and opinion surveys.

Conclusion: Linear utility functions in social choice enable improved methods for minimizing distortion, achieving better utilitarian outcomes and performing effectively in practical applications.

Abstract: Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate
on behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options.
When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using
preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian
social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a
worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities
have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for
value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural
to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the
first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we
investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and
randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of
the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or
voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for
minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We
empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems
using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing
language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our
instance-optimal algorithms.

### [417] [Strategic Costs of Perceived Bias in Fair Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20606)
*L. Elisa Celis,Lingxiao Huang,Milind Sohoni,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper models the role of perceived post-selection value in meritocratic systems using game theory, illustrating how differences in valuation propagate disparities in representation and social welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are persistent disparities across race, gender, and class in meritocratic systems. The paper aims to find the underlying mechanisms behind these gaps, exploring how social context and AI-driven career guidance influence outcomes.

Method: A game-theoretic model and a cost-sensitive optimization framework are developed to analyze candidates' strategic effort based on perceived post-selection value and institutional selectivity.

Result: The research derived formulas showing that valuation disparities and selectivity jointly impact effort levels, representation, and social welfare. Perception-driven biases lead to effort differences, creating disparities in seemingly fair systems.

Conclusion: The study bridges rational-choice and structural explanations of inequality, revealing how individual incentives and perceptions shaped by socio-technological environments contribute to systemic disparities in meritocratic systems.

Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward
skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class
challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality;
others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which
candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived
post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered
tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate
strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward;
effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on
merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and
derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional
selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and
utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that
quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities
without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a
perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across
groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort,
propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes.
While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle
linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and
structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments
shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.

TL;DR: Omics-GAN uses GANs to generate synthetic multi-omics data, enhancing disease predictions and facilitating biomarker and drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in multi-omics data analysis, such as limited sample sizes, noise, and heterogeneity, which hinder predictive accuracy.

Method: A GAN-based framework, Omics-GAN, was developed and tested on mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data from Alzheimer's disease (ROSMAP cohort) and cancer datasets (TCGA).

Result: Omics-GAN-generated synthetic data improved disease prediction accuracy across various datasets (e.g., AUC improvements for SVM classifiers) and preserved biological and statistical distributions.

Conclusion: Omics-GAN provides a scalable approach for precision medicine, improving prediction accuracy, preserving data fidelity, and accelerating biomarker and drug discovery processes.

Abstract: Multi-omics data integration is crucial for understanding complex diseases,
yet limited sample sizes, noise, and heterogeneity often reduce predictive
power. To address these challenges, we introduce Omics-GAN, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework designed to generate high-quality
synthetic multi-omics profiles while preserving biological relationships. We
evaluated Omics-GAN on three omics types (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation)
using the ROSMAP cohort for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TCGA datasets for
colon and liver cancer. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with repeated
5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that synthetic datasets consistently
improved prediction accuracy compared to original omics profiles. The AUC of
SVM for mRNA improved from 0.72 to 0.74 in AD, and from 0.68 to 0.72 in liver
cancer. Synthetic miRNA enhanced classification in colon cancer from 0.59 to
0.69, while synthetic methylation data improved performance in liver cancer
from 0.64 to 0.71. Boxplot analyses confirmed that synthetic data preserved
statistical distributions while reducing noise and outliers. Feature selection
identified significant genes overlapping with original datasets and revealed
additional candidates validated by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally,
molecular docking highlighted potential drug repurposing candidates, including
Nilotinib for AD, Atovaquone for liver cancer, and Tecovirimat for colon
cancer. Omics-GAN enhances disease prediction, preserves biological fidelity,
and accelerates biomarker and drug discovery, offering a scalable strategy for
precision medicine applications.

systems to assess phytochemical efficacy against the significant antidiabetic
enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DeepBindGCN and the AutoDock software
facilitated the investigation of binding interactions via deep learning

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the suitability of general-purpose generative models, specifically Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE), on microscopy image data and demonstrates its effectiveness in preserving phenotypic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for evaluating whether general-purpose generative models trained on natural images can be effectively applied to high-dimensional microscopy image data for phenotypic analysis.

Method: The authors systematically evaluated the reconstruction performance of SD-VAE on a large microscopy image dataset (Cell Painting images) with diverse molecular perturbations and cell types. They benchmarked reconstruction quality using pixel-level, embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics.

Result: The study found that SD-VAE preserves phenotypic signals in microscopy images with minimal loss. Additionally, general-purpose feature extractors like InceptionV3 performed as well as or better than specialized models in image retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The generative modeling approaches, especially off-the-shelf models like SD-VAE, are suitable for microscopy workflows, offering practical advantages for phenotypic drug discovery and reducing the need for bespoke models.

Abstract: High-throughput phenotypic screens generate vast microscopy image datasets
that push the limits of generative models due to their large dimensionality.
Despite the growing popularity of general-purpose models trained on natural

been quantitatively demonstrated. We present the first systematic evaluation of
Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing Cell
Painting images, assessing performance across a large dataset with diverse
molecular perturbations and cell types. We find that SD-VAE reconstructions
preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy
workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level,
embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically
informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like
InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval
tasks, simplifying future pipelines. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for evaluating generative models on microscopy data and support the use of

*Eulalie Boucher,Mihai Alexe,Peter Lean,Ewan Pinnington,Simon Lang,Patrick Laloyaux,Lorenzo Zampieri,Patricia de Rosnay,Niels Bormann,Anthony McNally*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: GraphDOP is a graph-based machine learning model for weather forecasting that directly uses Earth System observations, eliminating the need for traditional physics-based models. It integrates diverse observation sources into a unified space to capture interactions between components (e.g., atmosphere, ocean).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems struggle to accurately represent complex interactions across Earth System components, driving the need for innovative methods.

Method: GraphDOP learns directly from raw satellite and in-situ observations through a graph-based machine learning approach, embedding diverse data sources into a shared latent space without explicit coupling.

Result: The paper showcases case studies, including Arctic sea-ice freezing, Hurricane Ian-induced ocean cooling, and the European heat wave (2022), highlighting GraphDOP's ability to predict cross-component interactions during coupled processes.

Conclusion: GraphDOP demonstrates potential for end-to-end data-driven Earth System prediction by learning directly from observations, overcoming limitations of traditional models and enabling physically consistent forecasting.

Abstract: Interactions between different components of the Earth System (e.g. ocean,
atmosphere, land and cryosphere) are a crucial driver of global weather
patterns. Modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems typically run
separate models of the different components, explicitly coupled across their
interfaces to additionally model exchanges between the different components.
Accurately representing these coupled interactions remains a major scientific
and technical challenge of weather forecasting. GraphDOP is a graph-based
machine learning model that learns to forecast weather directly from raw
satellite and in-situ observations, without reliance on reanalysis products or
traditional physics-based NWP models. GraphDOP simultaneously embeds
information from diverse observation sources spanning the full Earth system
into a shared latent space. This enables predictions that implicitly capture
cross-domain interactions in a single model without the need for any explicit
coupling. Here we present a selection of case studies which illustrate the
capability of GraphDOP to forecast events where coupled processes play a
particularly key role. These include rapid sea-ice freezing in the Arctic,
mixing-induced ocean surface cooling during Hurricane Ian and the severe
European heat wave of 2022. The results suggest that learning directly from
Earth System observations can successfully characterise and propagate
cross-component interactions, offering a promising path towards physically
consistent end-to-end data-driven Earth System prediction with a single model.

Method: The framework applies a Swin Transformer-based architecture with periodic convolutions, conditional layer normalization, and a dual-branch decoder trained on ERA5 and IMERG datasets.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting moderate to heavy rainfall compared to the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), as validated by higher Critical Success Index scores.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based approaches effectively enhance medium-range precipitation forecasting, offering improved predictive skill for hydrometeorological risk applications.

Abstract: Accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting is crucial for
hydrometeorological risk management and disaster mitigation, yet remains
challenging for current numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Traditional
ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to
maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended
lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for
multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive
set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at
0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's
Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement
(GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including
upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin
Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal
continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer
normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other
variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized
training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE),
balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the
model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to
generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG
data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation
thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance
for moderate to heavy rainfall.

### [423] [FinCARE: Financial Causal Analysis with Reasoning and Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20221)
*Alejandro Michel,Abhinav Arun,Bhaskarjit Sarmah,Stefano Pasquali*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework that combines statistical causal discovery, financial knowledge graphs from SEC 10-K filings, and large language model reasoning. It enhances three types of causal discovery algorithms (PC, GES, NOTEARS) to improve financial analysis and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current correlation-based methods and heuristics in portfolio management and enable accurate identification of causal relationships for improved financial decision-making.

Method: The hybrid framework integrates statistical causal discovery algorithms with domain knowledge from financial knowledge graphs and large language models. Three causal discovery paradigms—constraint-based, score-based, and continuous optimization—are systematically improved using this approach.

Result: On a synthetic dataset of 500 firms, the enhanced methods showed significant improvements in F1 scores: PC (0.622 vs 0.459, +36%), GES (0.735 vs 0.367, +100%), and NOTEARS (0.759 vs 0.163, +366%). The framework also achieved a mean absolute error of 0.003610 and perfect directional accuracy in counterfactual predictions and intervention effects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines statistical and domain-driven knowledge to address limitations in existing financial causal analysis methods, offering reliable tools for portfolio managers to enhance risk management and strategic decision-making.

Abstract: Portfolio managers rely on correlation-based analysis and heuristic methods
that fail to capture true causal relationships driving performance. We present
a hybrid framework that integrates statistical causal discovery algorithms with
domain knowledge from two complementary sources: a financial knowledge graph
extracted from SEC 10-K filings and large language model reasoning. Our
approach systematically enhances three representative causal discovery
paradigms, constraint-based (PC), score-based (GES), and continuous
optimization (NOTEARS), by encoding knowledge graph constraints algorithmically
and leveraging LLM conceptual reasoning for hypothesis generation. Evaluated on
a synthetic financial dataset of 500 firms across 18 variables, our
KG+LLM-enhanced methods demonstrate consistent improvements across all three
algorithms: PC (F1: 0.622 vs. 0.459 baseline, +36%), GES (F1: 0.735 vs. 0.367,
+100%), and NOTEARS (F1: 0.759 vs. 0.163, +366%). The framework enables
reliable scenario analysis with mean absolute error of 0.003610 for
counterfactual predictions and perfect directional accuracy for intervention
effects. It also addresses critical limitations of existing methods by
grounding statistical discoveries in financial domain expertise while
maintaining empirical validation, providing portfolio managers with the causal
foundation necessary for proactive risk management and strategic
decision-making in dynamic market environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve financial volatility predictions by addressing challenges in integrating diverse data and ensuring temporal accuracy.

Method: This method integrates market data and news embeddings using Time Machine GPT and introduces an alignment loss to merge structured and unstructured data effectively.

Result: The framework outperformed existing models consistently across experiments, making it practically viable for financial applications.

Conclusion: M2VN is effective in solving challenges of data fusion and prediction bias, proving to be beneficial for financial modeling and decisions.

Abstract: We introduce M2VN: Multi-Modal Volatility Network, a novel deep
learning-based framework for financial volatility forecasting that unifies time
series features with unstructured news data. M2VN leverages the
representational power of deep neural networks to address two key challenges in
this domain: (i) aligning and fusing heterogeneous data modalities, numerical
financial data and textual information, and (ii) mitigating look-ahead bias
that can undermine the validity of financial models. To achieve this, M2VN
combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time
Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal
integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration
of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2VN consistently outperforms existing
baselines, underscoring its practical value for risk management and financial
decision-making in dynamic markets.

TL;DR: The paper explores quantum methods for solving differential equations, demonstrating two approaches—Differentiable Quantum Circuits (DQC) and Quantum Extremal Learning (QEL)—using a neutral atom quantum computer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient quantum-based solutions to differential equations in scientific computing.

Method: Experimental demonstration of differentiable quantum circuits (DQC) and quantum extremal learning (QEL) on a synthetic case using a commercial analog quantum computer.

Result: Successfully showcased the effectiveness of DQC and QEL for solving differential equations using neutral atom quantum technology.

Conclusion: DQC and QEL offer promising quantum-based strategies for solving differential equations and achieving extrema, and can function on analog quantum computers.

Abstract: Solving and optimizing differential equations (DEs) is ubiquitous in both
engineering and fundamental science. The promise of quantum architectures to
accelerate scientific computing thus naturally involved interest towards how
efficiently quantum algorithms can solve DEs. Differentiable quantum circuits
(DQC) offer a viable route to compute DE solutions using a variational approach
amenable to existing quantum computers, by producing a machine-learnable
surrogate of the solution. Quantum extremal learning (QEL) complements such
approach by finding extreme points in the output of learnable models of unknown
(implicit) functions, offering a powerful tool to bypass a full DE solution, in
cases where the crux consists in retrieving solution extrema. In this work, we
provide the results from the first experimental demonstration of both DQC and
QEL, displaying their performance on a synthetic usecase. Whilst both DQC and
QEL are expected to require digital quantum hardware, we successfully challenge
this assumption by running a closed-loop instance on a commercial analog
quantum computer, based upon neutral atom technology.

### [426] [Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728)
*Xi He,Sirui Lu,Bei Zeng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow for designing quantum codes with specified transversal diagonal gates using the SSLP framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of systematically designing quantum codes with diagonal transversal gates and ensuring verification of their properties.

Method: The approach uses the SSLP framework and GPT-5, implemented in a multi-agent platform (TeXRA). Different agents collaborate within a LaTeX-Python environment to systematically enumerate, verify, and classify quantum codes.

Result: The workflow produced certificate-backed tables for attainable cyclic logical groups, discovered new quantum codes, and demonstrated the ability to handle scenarios with residue degeneracy.

Conclusion: This scalable workflow enables reproducible quantum code constructions, facilitates systematic and analytical exploration, supports extensions to more complex codes, and advances data-driven classification of quantum codes.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

### [427] [On Encoding Matrices using Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20030)
*Liron Mor Yosef,Haim Avron*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the improvement of quantum algorithms for linear algebra by analyzing matrix encoding methods (block encodings and state preparation circuits) and provides efficient construction and conversion algorithms for these representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing has the potential to outperform classical approaches in numerical linear algebra, but effective implementation relies on representing matrices and vectors as quantum circuits.

Method: The paper studies block encodings and state preparation circuits, introduces efficient quantum construction methods from classical matrices, and develops algorithms for two-way conversions between these representations.

Result: Key results include (a) an efficient method for block encoding matrices from classical memory, and (b) bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, proving their equivalence.

Conclusion: The methods presented advance the construction and conversion of quantum circuit representations, confirming equivalence between block encodings and state preparation circuits and enhancing quantum linear algebra potential.

Abstract: Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the
potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with
complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL
algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms
critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum
circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common
circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state
preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices
in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine
methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical
form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations.
Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for
efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in
classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b)
low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and
state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially
equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our
constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously
multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an
algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in
the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli
matrices.

### [429] [Decoding the Ear: A Framework for Objectifying Expressiveness from Human Preference Through Efficient Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20513)
*Zhiyu Lin,Jingwen Yang,Jiale Zhao,Meng Liu,Sunzhu Li,Benyou Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeEAR, a novel framework for objectively evaluating speech expressiveness using fewer than 500 annotated samples, achieving high alignment with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but lack natural expressiveness due to the unavailability of reliable evaluation metrics.

Method: The proposed framework, DeEAR, evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity based on phonetics and psychology. It converts human preference for speech expressiveness into an objective score, achieving high correlation with human perception.

Result: DeEAR achieves strong correlation with human judgment (SRCC = 0.86) using a small dataset. It also benchmarks expressiveness gaps across S2S models and facilitates the creation of the ExpressiveSpeech dataset, which significantly improves the expressiveness score of S2S models.

Conclusion: DeEAR enables reliable and cost-effective evaluation of expressiveness in S2S models, supports better benchmarking and targeted data curation, and enhances the development of more expressive S2S systems.

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

TL;DR: This paper presents UniSE, a unified decoder-only language model for multiple speech enhancement tasks, showing competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive language models in unifying different speech enhancement tasks.

Method: Propose UniSE, a decoder-only autoregressive language model that handles speech enhancement tasks by taking input speech features and generating discrete tokens of target speech.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that UniSE achieves competitive performance across multiple speech tasks compared to other baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study shows that language models have the capacity to unify and effectively handle multiple speech enhancement tasks.

Abstract: The development of neural audio codecs (NACs) has largely promoted
applications of language models (LMs) to speech processing and understanding.
However, there lacks the verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive
(AR) LMbased models in unifying different sub-tasks of speech enhancement (SE).
In this work, we propose UniSE, a unified decoder-only LM-based framework to
handle different SE tasks including speech restoration, target speaker
extraction and speech separation. It takes input speech features as conditions
and generates discrete tokens of the target speech using AR modeling, which
facilitates a compatibility between distinct learning patterns of multiple
tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks indicate the proposed UniSE can
achieve competitive performance compared to discriminative and generative
baselines, showing the capacity of LMs in unifying SE tasks. The demo page is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance immersive auditory experience in virtual environments by improving sound modeling techniques.

Method: It introduces a task called resounding, leverages reciprocity properties, and combines physics-inspired approaches with self-supervised learning to estimate room impulse responses for dynamic emitter positions.

Result: Versa improves acoustic field learning performance across simulated and real-world datasets, achieving notable gains in perceptual studies for immersive spatial sound.

Conclusion: Versa facilitates robust and flexible sound modeling, obtaining high performance in improving spatial sound experiences for virtual environments.

Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires
flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper,
we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse
responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter
positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the
reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to
facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid
samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener
poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to
emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach
to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance
of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across
different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve
the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces R2-SVC, a singing voice conversion (SVC) framework that resolves challenges in noisy, real-world applications through robust and expressive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by environmental noise and the need for expressive singing voice outputs in real-world SVC scenarios, where conventional methods fail due to dependence on clean data.

Method: R2-SVC enhances robustness by simulating random $F_0$ perturbations and music separation artifacts, enriching speaker representation with diverse singing data including DNSMOS-filtered vocals, and integrating a Neural Source-Filter (NSF) model for improved naturalness and control.

Result: R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art performance on various SVC benchmarks under clean and noisy conditions by preserving speaker timbre and capturing singing nuances.

Conclusion: The proposed R2-SVC framework effectively tackles noise and expressiveness challenges in SVC applications, making it suitable for practical real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental
noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges.
Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for
real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean
data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of
diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these
issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we
introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental
frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations
(e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy
conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific
singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated
vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker
timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural
Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise
components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing.
R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both
clean and noisy conditions.

*Michael Goodrich,Yan Gu,Ryuto Kitagawa,Yihan Sun*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Fork-Join I/O Model to analyze I/O efficiency in parallel algorithms for set operations on balanced search trees, with a proposed solution based on B-trees achieving notable I/O work and span bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of input/output access patterns in existing parallel join-based trees and the lack of provable bounds on I/O costs motivated the study.

Method: The authors developed the Fork-Join I/O Model to measure I/O costs in parallel computation and proposed algorithms using B-trees within this model.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves $O(m \log_B(n/m))$ I/O work and $O(\log_B m \cdot \log_2 \log_B n + \log_B n)$ I/O span for operations like union, intersection, and difference on B-trees.

Conclusion: The paper provides a provable I/O-efficient solution for parallel set operations using the Fork-Join I/O Model, addressing existing inefficiencies in parallel join-based frameworks and enhancing theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Balanced search trees are widely used in computer science to efficiently
maintain dynamic ordered data. To support efficient set operations (e.g.,
union, intersection, difference) using trees, the join-based framework is
widely studied. This framework has received particular attention in the
parallel setting, and has been shown to be effective in enabling simple and
theoretically efficient set operations on trees. Despite the widespread
adoption of parallel join-based trees, a major drawback of previous work on
such data structures is the inefficiency of their input/output (I/O) access
patterns. Some recent work (e.g., C-trees and PaC-trees) focused on more
I/O-friendly implementations of these algorithms. Surprisingly, however, there
have been no results on bounding the I/O-costs for these algorithms. It remains
open whether these algorithms can provide tight, provable guarantees in
I/O-costs on trees.
  This paper studies efficient parallel algorithms for set operations based on
search tree algorithms using a join-based framework, with a special focus on
achieving I/O efficiency in these algorithms. To better capture the
I/O-efficiency in these algorithms in parallel, we introduce a new
computational model, Fork-Join I/O Model, to measure the I/O costs in fork-join
parallelism. This model measures the total block transfers (I/O work) and their
critical path (I/O span). Under this model, we propose our new solution based
on B-trees. Our parallel algorithm computes the union, intersection, and
difference of two B-trees with $O(m \log_B(n/m))$ I/O work and $O(\log_B m
\cdot \log_2 \log_B n + \log_B n)$ I/O span, where $n$ and $m \leq n$ are the
sizes of the two trees, and $B$ is the block size.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where features extracted at edge devices are transformed before being transmitted to model servers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based sensing at the wireless edge can enhance applications like autonomous driving and environmental monitoring, but requires addressing privacy risks when transmitting features between devices and servers.

Method: The study proposes a framework where devices apply transformations to extracted features before sending them to the model server, aiming to reduce privacy risks.

Result: The framework highlights the need for protecting individual feature privacy during the transmission phase in edge networks.

Conclusion: This framework offers a novel solution for ensuring privacy-preservation in AI-based sensing, especially during the inference phase of AI applications.

Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly
enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and
perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI
systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference
phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks
(e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model
servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As
sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of
the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While
differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets,
protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where
devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a
model server.

*Brandon Kaplowitz*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper proposes reinforcement learning with neural networks to explain household consumption behavior during downturns, providing a unifying framework for empirical patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve empirical puzzles regarding household consumption during economic downturns, focusing on marginal propensities to consume and scarring effects.

Method: It uses a reinforcement learning model with Q-learning and neural network approximation, deviating from rational expectations to study consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty.

Result: The model replicates key patterns: higher MPCs for low-asset unemployed households and persistent lower consumption levels with past unemployment experiences, aligning with literature findings.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning explains how past experiences shape consumption behavior, providing insights beyond current economic conditions with close simulation alignment to empirical data.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling
empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns.
I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation
to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from
standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key
findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low
liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume
(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs
0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with
Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment
experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling
for current economic conditions, a "scarring" effect documented by Malmendier
and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about
income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism
generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through
value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation
results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive
learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for
understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond
what current economic conditions would predict.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an effective tool for accurate cosmological inference with robust uncertainty quantification, advancing precision cosmology.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern
cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information
from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian
graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a
primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a
spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to
respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To
advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty
quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the
framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the
model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates
exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the
magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and
GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate
parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides
reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust
cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.

Motivation: The study aims to enhance the precision of movement quantification in resistance training using AI, addressing variability and improving exercise prescription.

Method: The authors processed video data to extract joint-angle trajectories, analyzed metrics like range of motion and tempo, applied a meta-analytic model, and introduced a novel metric for evaluating training methods.

Result: Partial range-of-motion exercises were performed with smaller ROM and shorter durations, with participant characteristics driving variability rather than exercise-specific factors.

Conclusion: AI-based methods can effectively analyze and improve understanding of movement dynamics in resistance training, aiding in better exercise recommendations.

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.
