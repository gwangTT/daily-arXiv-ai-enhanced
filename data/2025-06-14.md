### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a conjecture about a trade-off in AI between guaranteed correctness and the ability to handle complex data, reframing debates in AI design and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and explicitly address the implicit trade-off in AI between provable correctness (error-free guarantees) and the capacity to handle high-dimensional data.

Method: The conjecture is presented in an information-theoretic framework, contextualized within epistemological, formal verification, and philosophical discussions. Historical motivations, implications, and broader debates are analyzed.

Result: The conjecture highlights the tension between symbolic AI's narrow error-free focus and generative models' broader but error-prone capabilities, impacting evaluation and governance standards.

Conclusion: Proving or refuting the conjecture is deemed critical for advancing trustworthy AI, shaping philosophical and engineering expectations.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the concept of "context-switching" AI models in healthcare that can dynamically adapt their reasoning without requiring retraining, ensuring medical AI is more effective across specialties, populations, and clinical roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models struggle to adjust dynamically to new populations, specialties, and settings due to reliance on fine-tuning, prompting, or retrieval methods. This leads to contextual errors and limits their application in diverse and evolving medical scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes the concept of "context-switching" medical AI, aiming for models capable of dynamic adaptation to changing contexts in medical care without needing retraining.

Result: N/A (Perspective paper discussing theoretical vision and proposal.)

Conclusion: Context-switching AI has the potential to improve diagnostic, management, and treatment capabilities across diverse medical specialties and environments, while also enabling broader access to medical care.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [LogiPlan: A Structured Benchmark for Logical Planning and Relational Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10527)
*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan is a new benchmark to evaluate logical planning and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through tasks like Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question, showing that performance varies with model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for assessing the logical planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs when interacting with complex relational structures.

Method: The benchmark includes three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question, with dynamic task complexity variation based on objects, relations, and relational chain depth. Models are also evaluated on their ability to self-correct.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4.5, Llama 3.1, and others, showed promising results on simple tasks but struggled with high-complexity scenarios, revealing performance gaps tied to model design and scale.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for further improvements in LLM reasoning and planning capabilities, especially for handling complex relational structures.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

### [4] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the distinction between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's research, utilizing XGBoost and SHAP to identify key features influencing disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research was motivated by the need to distinguish causation from correlation to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.

Method: Correlation analysis, machine learning classification using XGBoost, and SHAP interpretability techniques were employed.

Result: Key features such as cognitive scores and genetic risk factors strongly influenced disease classification. Correlation matrices revealed interrelated clusters, while SHAP values detailed feature contributions.

Conclusion: The study highlights that strong correlations don’t imply causation and emphasizes the importance of integrating statistical and interpretability methods for future causal inference and improved diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [5] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores methods to improve trustworthy AI systems focusing on safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability. Contributions include safety shields, fairness shields, and metrics for agency and intention in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expanded integration of AI in critical societal areas necessitates enhanced trustworthiness, focusing on safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

Method: Methods include extended deterministic safety shielding techniques, fairness shields for group fairness in decision-making, and transparency metrics for assessing agency and intentionality in AI systems.

Result: Developed efficient safety shields, fairness enforcement techniques, and metrics for transparency in AI. Validated these tools in simulated conditions and frameworks.

Conclusion: The research presents practical methods for safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems while introducing foundational frameworks for advancing trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [6] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces WGSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) capabilities in strategic reasoning using wargames as a complex test scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fill the research gap by systematically evaluating the strategic reasoning abilities of LLMs, a critical yet underexplored aspect of human-like cognition, in dynamic multi-agent environments.

Method: The paper designs WGSR-Bench, a framework based on wargames, integrating three core tasks—environmental situation awareness, opponent risk modeling, and policy generation, which together form the S-POE architecture. An LLM-based wargame agent is also developed for comprehensive assessments.

Result: WGSR-Bench enables evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs in strategic reasoning, highlighting their strengths and limitations in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: Introducing WGSR-Bench provides a pivotal step to assess and advance LLMs’ strategic reasoning capabilities, encouraging further research in model-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [7] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper frames AI as a transformative cognitive revolution driving productivity, resembling the impact of written language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's emergence as a cognitive productivity engine and its parallels to historical innovations like written language.

Method: Theoretical analysis combined with examples from various domains, integrating computer science, economic, and sociological perspectives.

Result: Conceptual frameworks showing AI's role in amplifying knowledge work and reshaping cognitive productivity.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognition, demanding a reevaluation of skills, organizations, and policies for the new productivity paradigm.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [8] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies computational complexity barriers to verifying AI safety as systems grow in capability, citing exponential complexity and measure-zero safe policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the computational limitations in verifying AI safety as AI capabilities scale, addressing the urgent challenge posed by the growing societal risks.

Method: The study formalizes the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic and proves four theorems using complexity theory analysis. Safe policy fractions, alignment gaps, and safety property measures are rigorously derived.

Result: Key findings include exponential growth in verification complexity, sparse safe policies, incompleteness of alignment techniques, and measure-zero sets for robust safety in neural networks.

Conclusion: AI systems face a strategic trilemma: constrain complexity, accept unverifiable risks, or innovate fundamentally new safety paradigms. Verifiable safety becomes impractical beyond certain capability thresholds.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [9] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGC-Bench—a multi-agent learning benchmark for Pokémon Video Game Championships (VGC) focused on generalization across an extremely large and diverse set of team strategies. It evaluates several AI methods and highlights the challenges of scaling and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of developing AI agents that can generalize and adapt to drastically diverse strategic environments, as exemplified by Pokémon VGC's combinatorially vast team configurations.

Method: The authors created a benchmark (VGC-Bench) which includes infrastructure, evaluation protocols, datasets, and baseline algorithms, including large-language-model agents, reinforcement learning, and game-theoretic approaches.

Result: While some models perform well in restricted settings where they train and evaluate on a single team, their performance drops significantly when generalizing to diverse team configurations, indicating limitations in current approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that robust policy generalization for multi-agent learning in domains like Pokémon VGC remains an open challenge and provides VGC-Bench as a resource to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

### [10] [Optimus-3: Towards Generalist Multimodal Minecraft Agents with Scalable Task Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10357)
*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimus-3, an advanced Minecraft agent built using innovative techniques in data generation, task management, and multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a generalist agent capable of handling perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft, overcoming challenges like insufficient data, task interference, and visual diversity.

Method: The paper proposes three innovations: a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for task-level routing, and a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach.

Result: Optimus-3 outperforms both other multimodal large language models and current state-of-the-art agents in various Minecraft tasks, as evidenced by experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide scalable and effective solutions for building generalist agents in open-world environments, with Optimus-3 being a testament to these advancements.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

### [11] [NeuroPAL: Punctuated Anytime Learning with Neuroevolution for Macromanagement in Starcraft: Brood War](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10384)
*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroPAL, a framework that combines NEAT with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL) to improve training efficiency in StarCraft: Brood War AI, achieving competitive strategies in half the usual training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency in traditional StarCraft AI methods, which typically use rule-based systems or supervised learning.

Method: The NeuroPAL framework integrates Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL), alternating between low-fidelity training and periodic high-fidelity evaluations to enhance sample efficiency.

Result: NeuroPAL was tested in a StarCraft: Brood War fixed-map, single-race scenario and demonstrated that PAL accelerates the learning process, allowing agents to reach competitive play in half the training time compared to NEAT alone. Agents also exhibited expert-like strategies.

Conclusion: The study concludes that structured mechanisms like PAL improve the scalability and efficiency of neuroevolution for complex real-time strategy games, highlighting its potential in enhancing AI adaptability and strategy discovery.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mirage-1, a multimodal cross-platform GUI agent, featuring hierarchical skills and a tree search algorithm that improves performance in long-horizon tasks compared to existing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the challenges faced by GUI agents in executing long-horizon tasks online, such as insufficient knowledge and domain gap issues.

Method: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module for organizing knowledge hierarchically and the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm to optimize action search in online environments.

Result: Mirage-1 significantly outperforms existing agents in various benchmarks, including AndroidWorld and AndroidLH, with improvements up to 79%.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising solution for long-horizon tasks by effectively bridging the offline-online domain gap and improving task execution through hierarchical knowledge structuring and skill augmentation.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static pipeline RAG systems face limitations in complex, real-world tasks requiring dynamic reasoning and retrieval. This paper aims to evaluate and categorize approaches addressing these challenges.

overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

### [14] [Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420)
*Boris Sedlak,Alireza Furutanpey,Zihang Wang,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework for edge computing, comparing four types of scaling agents, and demonstrates their effectiveness in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoscaling is unsuitable for edge computing due to resource constraints, prompting the need for multi-dimensional elasticity.

Method: Developed and tested an agent-based framework across four scaling approaches using YOLOv8 (visual recognition) and OpenCV (QR code detection).

Result: All agents improved SLO performance, with differing convergence speeds depending on the approach (e.g., pre-training advantages, scalability benefits).

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling is feasible and beneficial for edge environments, warranting further exploration.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OIBench is a newly released, challenging informatics benchmark dataset designed to test models' algorithmic reasoning using olympiad-level problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional benchmarks are becoming less useful as models advance, highlighting the need for harder benchmarks to promote algorithmic reasoning capabilities.

Method: The benchmark consists of 250 carefully curated problems, uses contamination-resistant methods, introduces Time/Space Completion Curves for efficiency analysis, and conducts experiments comparing human and model performances.

Result: Experiments show open-source models perform worse than closed-source ones, but SOTA models outperform most humans in correctness and efficiency while still being suboptimal compared to canonical solutions.

Conclusion: OIBench, released as an open-source dataset, is expected to drive advancements in code reasoning for future large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scientists' First Exam (SFE), a benchmark to evaluate scientific cognitive capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs fall short in assessing their perception and reasoning abilities, which are crucial for scientific discovery.

Method: The authors designed SFE with 830 expert-verified VQA pairs covering three levels: perception, attribute understanding, and comparative reasoning, across five disciplines.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 perform poorly, achieving only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE.

Conclusion: SFE provides measurable insights into the gaps and opportunities in MLLMs, promoting advancements in AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Primender sequence, combining primes and digit-based rules, and uses it for benchmarking symbolic reasoning in LLMs like ChatGPT and LLaMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an interpretable and rule-based test environment for assessing LLMs' abilities to infer hidden rules, test hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic.

Method: A novel integer sequence called the Primender sequence is designed. Multiple LLMs are evaluated on their ability to uncover its defining rule, validate a hypothesis about the sequence, and generate its terms. Comparative metrics like accuracy, hypothesis testing, and explanation quality are used.

Result: The Primender sequence provides a deterministic but complex structure, and their framework effectively benchmarks LLMs in terms of symbolic reasoning and sequence generation.

Conclusion: The study introduces a mathematical tool for evaluating LLMs, fostering advancements at the intersection of number theory, AI, and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic method for complex cyber-physical systems using minimal prior knowledge by combining a neural network-based symptom generator and a graph diagnosis algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods require extensive prior data or models, which poses challenges in practical scenarios.

Method: The approach employs a neural network for subsystem anomaly detection and a graph diagnosis algorithm using basic causal relationships.

Result: Experiments indicate 82% inclusion of true causal components and 73% reduction in search space; real-world testing confirms practical applicability.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for diagnosing large, complex systems with limited prior information.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleMath, a benchmark dataset for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving mathematically intensive problems in telecommunications, highlighting both the challenges and advancements in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the gap in evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in handling specialized and mathematically challenging tasks within the telecommunications domain, an area with limited prior exploration.

Method: The authors created TeleMath, a dataset of 500 Telecommunications-oriented mathematical QnAs, developed using a seed of problems from Subject Matter Experts, and evaluated the performance of various LLMs on these tasks.

Result: The study found that recent LLMs tailored for mathematical and logical reasoning outperformed general-purpose models, demonstrating the need for domain-specific optimization for achieving success in this area.

Conclusion: TeleMath serves as a foundational step towards advancing research on LLMs in telecommunications. By releasing the dataset and evaluation code, the authors encourage further development of domain-specialized LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

*Tom Westermann,Aljosha Köcher,Felix Gehlhoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline for automating the validation of AutomationML (AML) modeling constraints via OWL ontologies and SHACL constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AML modeling constraints are informal and cannot be automatically validated, posing challenges in ensuring compliance and consistency.

Method: AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies using RML and SPARQL. Large Language Models translate informal rules into SHACL constraints, which are validated against the generated AML ontology. Results are presented in natural language.

Result: The pipeline enables semi-automated validation of complex AML modeling rules without requiring expertise in formal methods or ontology technology.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness in formalizing and validating AML constraints, simplifying the task for non-experts.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve computational reasoning about continuous changes by combining answer set programming with satisfiability modulo theories.

Method: The authors developed a compiler that translates the tight fragment of ASPMT programs into SMT instances using gringo for partial grounding and z3 for processing variables.

Result: The compiler 'aspsmt2smt' successfully handles real number computations and enables effective reasoning about continuous changes.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates the practicality of leveraging ASPMT for real-world computational problems involving continuous changes.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing neuro-symbolic models in handling counterfactual reasoning tasks about causal relations in video dynamics.

Method: Introduces causal graphs representing event relations and employs Answer Set Programming to coordinate perception and simulation modules, alongside the integration of large pre-trained language models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models, and improves CRAFT benchmark results using GPT-3.5/GPT-4 enhanced by symbolic causal reasoning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that symbolic reasoning combined with neuro-symbolic models and large language model integration can enhance counterfactual reasoning capabilities in video dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the potential of LLMs in solving and optimizing complex iterative tasks using historical feedback.

Method: They developed OPT-BENCH, a diverse benchmark, and OPT-Agent, a framework that uses iterative reasoning to improve solutions, testing them on 9 LLMs from 6 model families.

Result: Experiments revealed that leveraging historical feedback improves optimization performance on both ML and NP tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating feedback and iterative reasoning enhances LLM capabilities, contributing to advancements in optimization tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex

explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for simulating human spatiotemporal behavior have limitations in computational cost, scalability, and generalizability, prompting the exploration of LLMs as alternative urban simulation tools.

Method: The framework uses chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning combined with six Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, enabling human-like reasoning and efficient spatiotemporal behavior simulations.

Result: Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district with 1,000 samples showed the generated behavior data closely matched real mobile signaling patterns, achieving quality scores of 7.86 to 8.36 and improving processing efficiency with scaled-up parallelization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework integrates CoT and MCP effectively, demonstrating LLM application in urban behavior modeling and synthetic mobility data generation, with potential benefits for smart city planning and design.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Result: GenPlanX is effective in assisting users with office-related tasks, illustrating its ability to enhance workflows and productivity.

Conclusion: GenPlanX demonstrates the potential of combining LLMs with classical AI planning engines to improve human-AI collaboration and streamline task execution.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for molecular toxicity repair using general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), along with an evaluation framework, ToxiEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug development often fails in early stages due to toxicity, and there's a lack of systematic benchmarks for molecular toxicity repair.

Method: The authors created ToxiMol, a benchmark dataset with 11 tasks and 560 toxic molecules. They also developed ToxiEval, an automated evaluation framework that assesses toxicity reduction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity.

Result: Experimental results on nearly 30 MLLMs show that while current models struggle with the task, they exhibit initial promising abilities in understanding toxicity and editing molecules structurally.

Conclusion: Toxicity repair in molecules is a challenging but promising field. This paper establishes benchmarks and tools for systematic evaluation, paving the way for advancements in MLLM applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uncovers the effectiveness of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in improving mathematical reasoning in specific models like Qwen2.5-Math-7B, even with unreliable or incorrect rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores whether RLVR can improve mathematical reasoning in models and aims to understand its effects despite the use of spurious or irrelevant rewards.

Method: The researchers applied RLVR to various reward types (random, incorrect labels, etc.) across different model families, focusing particularly on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model.

Result: They observed performance boosts in Qwen2.5-Math-7B across different spurious reward conditions but found mixed results when applying RLVR to other models like Llama3 or OLMo2.

Conclusion: RLVR likely leverages pretrained reasoning representations, but its impact varies across different model families. The authors stress the need for validating RLVR on diverse models in future research.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

Result: Findings show carbon emissions have risen 50x in recent years due to AI-driven demand, with power efficiency and manufacturing emissions being key sustainability challenges.

Conclusion: Modern processors are not sustainably designed. Effective strategies are needed to mitigate rising carbon emissions and enhance environmental sustainability in the chip industry.

Abstract: Over the years, the chip industry has consistently developed high-performance
processors to address the increasing demands across diverse applications.
However, the rapid expansion of chip production has significantly increased
carbon emissions, raising critical concerns about environmental sustainability.
While researchers have previously modeled the carbon footprint (CFP) at both
system and processor levels, a holistic analysis of sustainability trends
encompassing the entire chip lifecycle remains lacking. This paper presents
CarbonSet, a comprehensive dataset integrating sustainability and performance
metrics for CPUs and GPUs over the past decade. CarbonSet aims to benchmark and
assess the design of next-generation processors. Leveraging this dataset, we
conducted detailed analysis of flagship processors' sustainability trends over
the last decade. This paper further highlights that modern processors are not
yet sustainably designed, with total carbon emissions increasing more than
50$\times$ in the past three years due to the surging demand driven by the AI
boom. Power efficiency remains a significant concern, while advanced process
nodes pose new challenges requiring to effectively amortize the dramatically
increased manufacturing carbon emissions.

### [29] [EasyDRAM: An FPGA-based Infrastructure for Fast and Accurate End-to-End Evaluation of Emerging DRAM Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10441)
*Oğuzhan Canpolat,Ataberk Olgun,David Novo,Oğuz Ergin,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: EasyDRAM is an FPGA-based framework designed to address the challenges of evaluating DRAM techniques on real chips without requiring deep hardware expertise or encountering inaccuracies associated with modern systems' clock disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility and accuracy in evaluating DRAM techniques, which are essential for enhancing modern computing systems but face challenges like requiring extensive expertise in hardware languages and modeling modern systems.

Method: EasyDRAM incorporates high-level language (C++) support for DRAM technique implementation and introduces 'time scaling' to accurately model the processor-DRAM interface despite clock frequency disparities.

Result: EasyDRAM provides an accessible and accurate platform for evaluating DRAM techniques, validated against real computing systems, and is open-sourced for collaborative research.

Conclusion: EasyDRAM mitigates key limitations of prior FPGA-based platforms, enabling researchers to innovate rapidly in memory system design, making advanced DRAM evaluations more accessible and accurate.

Abstract: DRAM is a critical component of modern computing systems. Recent works
propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance
DRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing
capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide
benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications
across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based
platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM
chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)
they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting
accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern
computing systems.
  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate
end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes
the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,
EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by
enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language
(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design
in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental
challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically
operate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to
replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling
the processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel
technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior
of the modeled system.
  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory
system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research EasyDRAM
implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/EasyDRAM.

*Luca Colagrande,Lorenzo Leone,Maximilian Coco,Andrei Deaconeasa,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes microarchitectural optimizations for RISC-V based ML accelerators, improving utilization and efficiency while retaining programmability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing computational demands of ML workloads require accelerators that balance efficiency and flexibility, prompting the need for architectural enhancements to address control flow and memory access inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose a microarchitecture featuring 'zero-overhead loop nests' for control flow optimization and a 'zero-conflict memory subsystem' with a double-buffering-aware interconnect to reduce memory bank conflicts.

Result: The optimizations result in near-ideal utilization rates (96.1%-99.4%), 11% performance improvement, and 8% energy efficiency gains compared to the state-of-the-art RISC-V cluster.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides performance and efficiency comparable to specialized accelerators, while offering broader programmability and workload support.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have
driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between
efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML
accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing
multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for
key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However,
instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations
that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory
access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a
state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we
propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these
inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce
"zero-overhead loop nests" to remove control overheads, and a "zero-conflict
memory subsystem", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to
eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain
near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and
8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We
demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA
accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a
fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider
range of workloads.

*Melina Soysal,Konstantina Koliogeorgi,Can Firtina,Nika Mansouri Ghiasi,Rakesh Nadig,Haiyu Mayo,Geraldo F. Oliveira,Yu Liang,Klea Zambaku,Mohammad Sadrosadati,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MARS is a storage-centric system that accelerates raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) by tackling computation and data movement bottlenecks, achieving significant performance and energy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing demand to match the rapidly increasing throughput of genome sequencing technologies with high-performance, energy-efficient systems for RSGA. Current RSGA approaches face bottlenecks, as I/O data movement becomes the main contributor to runtime and energy consumption.

Method: MARS uses a hardware/software co-design approach that integrates filtering mechanisms, quantization schemes, and in-storage execution (Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms). It also orchestrates parallelism within storage systems to optimize RSGA.

Result: MARS achieves an average performance gain of 93x over basecalling-based software and 40x over hardware-accelerated read mapping pipelines, while reducing energy consumption by 427x and 72x, respectively.

Conclusion: MARS effectively addresses the computational and data movement bottlenecks of RSGA, offering a scalable and energy-efficient solution by leveraging modern storage system capabilities.

Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to
enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals.
However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly
difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal
generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques
can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the
performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As
sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to
both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a
high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the
data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We
propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous
resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage
controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both
data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and
low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software
co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering
mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing
for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly
within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and
Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of
all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.
Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and
hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on
average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by
427x and 72x.

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified taxonomy and review of automatic evaluation methods for generative AI outputs across text, image, and audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a systematic framework to organize automatic evaluation methods for generated content across different modalities, including text, image, and audio.

Method: It proposes a comprehensive review and unified taxonomy by identifying five fundamental paradigms and extending them across various domains.

Result: The paper successfully organizes and compares evaluation methods for generative outputs in text, images, and audio, demonstrating the framework's applicability across these modalities.

Conclusion: A unified framework enhances understanding and highlights promising directions for cross-modal automatic evaluation, paving the way for further research in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces TaskCraft, a system to automate the generation of complex, multi-tool tasks for AI models, presenting a scalable approach with a synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP and AI tasks lack sufficient autonomy and tool interaction, while benchmarks are costly and not easily scalable; hence, there is a demand for more robust methods.

Method: The authors developed TaskCraft, which uses depth-based and width-based expansions to create multi-step, tool-integrative, scalable tasks with execution trajectories.

Result: Empirical results indicate improved prompt optimization and enhanced supervised fine-tuning for agentic foundation models. A dataset of 36,000 scalable tasks was created.

Conclusion: TaskCraft provides a scalable solution for creating complex agentic tasks, supporting advances in agent tuning and evaluation for NLP and AI models.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the inherent limitations of natural language due to semantic degeneracy and proposes an observer-dependent interpretive model. Using Kolmogorov complexity and Bell inequality tests on ambiguous interpretation by LLMs, the authors demonstrate non-classical contextuality and advocate for Bayesian methods over classical linguistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inherent limitations and complexities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing due to semantic degeneracy, where the complexity of expressions complicates accurate interpretation beyond polysemy.

Method: The authors used Kolmogorov complexity to argue computational intractability in resolving meanings and conducted semantic Bell inequality tests with LLMs to interpret ambiguous word pairs across various contexts.

Result: The experiments recorded average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with some runs significantly violating classical deterministic limits ($|S|\leq2$), suggesting non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that classical frameworks for linguistic analysis are insufficient due to their lossiness and advocate for Bayesian-style sampling methods, better suited for accounting for ambiguity and observer dependency in interpretation.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

### [36] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) to measure behavioral changes in large language models (LLMs) when faced with semantically equivalent but reworded prompts, revealing model-specific response shifts tied to tokenization and decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model evaluation metrics often ignore variability in model responses caused by semantically equivalent rewording, a gap this research seeks to address.

Method: The authors developed PBSS, a diagnostic framework, and applied it to ten constrained tasks, analyzing how LLM responses change under semantically identical but differently worded prompts.

Result: PBSS identified consistent, model-specific shifts in behavior caused by tokenization and decoding processes, showing that LLMs are sensitive to subtle prompt variations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of considering prompt rewording in model evaluation and suggests revisiting tokenization and decoding to enhance model stability and reliability.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartReasoner, a framework for precise reasoning over chart images by converting them into structured codes and generating a multimodal dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extending reasoning capabilities to visual tasks like chart question answering, which require preserving critical visual details often lost in image-to-text conversion.

Method: ChartReasoner uses a two-stage framework by first converting charts into structured ECharts codes and then synthesizing a chart reasoning dataset with a code validator to ensure quality. The final model is trained using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: ChartReasoner achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art open-source models and proprietary systems like GPT-4o, while using fewer parameters and preserving chart details in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the ability to perform interpretable and precise visual reasoning over charts, offering an efficient and scalable solution for multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

TL;DR: This study proposes an unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune large language models without external supervision, achieving better or comparable performance compared to human-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of improving pretrained language models for complex tasks where obtaining human supervision is difficult or impractical.

Method: The authors introduce ICM, which fine-tunes language models using their own generated labels rather than relying on external human supervision.

Result: ICM matches or exceeds the performance of models trained on human-provided labels in several tasks, demonstrating exceptional results on superhuman capability tasks.

Conclusion: Their approach enables better elicitation of superhuman language model capabilities and proves to be beneficial for training frontier language models using unsupervised techniques.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how reliably large language models (LLMs) assess empathic communication compared to experts and crowdworkers, using four evaluative frameworks across 200 real-world conversations. Results show LLMs approach expert-level benchmarks and outperform crowdworkers in reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the ability of LLMs to reliably judge empathic communication nuances in text-based conversations, especially in emotionally sensitive contexts.

Method: The study involved collecting 3,150 expert, 2,844 crowdworker, and 3,150 LLM annotations for empathic communication across four psychology, communications, and NLP frameworks applied to conversations. Inter-rater reliability was assessed across these groups.

Result: LLMs consistently performed near expert-level benchmarks and exceeded the reliability of crowdworkers across all evaluative frameworks.

Conclusion: LLMs, when validated with suitable benchmarks, can boost transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications like conversational companions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Motivation: To advance sentiment analysis in a low-resource language like Bangla, using the EmoNoBa dataset.

Method: Linear SVM, KNN, Random Forest, PCA, BiLSTM, AdaBoost, and LIME were applied to analyze emotions with dimensionality reduction and explainable AI techniques.

Result: Insights were gained into optimizing machine learning models and understanding their predictions for Bangla emotion analysis.

Conclusion: This study contributes to understanding emotion analysis in a resource-limited language and compares various machine learning approaches for efficiency.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized measurement and disclosure of human capital in corporate value creation.

Method: A machine learning algorithm, word2vec, is trained on confirmed HC disclosures, categorizing HC-related keywords into five subcategories, with examples provided for code use.

Result: The authors created a comprehensive HC lexicon, shared associated disclosure data and Python code, and illustrated potential applications, including using it for fine-tuning a BERT model.

Conclusion: The study provides tools to understand HC disclosures and suggests opportunities for future research in HC management and reporting.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of LLMs like GPT-4 to generate high-quality stories by solving narrative planning problems, revealing strengths and limitations in aspects like causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate the storytelling capabilities of LLMs in depth, especially considering their limitations and potential when applied to narrative planning.

Method: The authors proposed a benchmark derived from literature examples to evaluate LLMs on narrative planning. This included metrics such as causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict, with experiments conducted primarily on GPT-4 level models.

Result: GPT-4-level LLMs are effective at producing causally coherent stories at a small scale, but they struggle with narrative planning involving character intentionality and dramatic conflict. Reinforcement learning may be necessary to handle more complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of LLMs' narrative generation scope and challenges, offering insights for improving their application in contexts like game environments and more complex storytelling tasks.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q2E, a method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, improving query decomposition and integrating multimodal knowledge for enhanced retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by leveraging latent parametric knowledge from LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Q2E employs a Query-to-Event decomposition technique to analyze and enhance human queries, using LLMs and VLMs for deeper understanding and entropy-based fusion scoring for multimodal information.

Result: Evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that Q2E outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows significant improvement when integrating audio information for text-to-video retrieval.

Conclusion: Q2E enhances text-to-video retrieval by leveraging LLMs and VLMs for refined query decomposition and multimodal fusion, advancing research in multimedia retrieval systems.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench evaluates reasoning models using strategic and logical tasks resembling Tic-Tac-Toe games. Findings reveal LRMs, strong in math, falter on these simpler tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LRMs' reasoning capabilities outside STEM-focused benchmarks and understand their performance on simpler strategic tasks that humans solve effortlessly.

Method: Developing TTT-Bench, a benchmark with programmatically-generated two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, evaluating LRMs' performance on them, and comparing to their results on mathematical test benchmarks.

Result: Top LRMs performed significantly worse on TTT-Bench (-41% vs MATH 500, -5% vs AIME 2024). Larger models did slightly better but struggled with prolonged strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: Despite excelling at complex math tasks, LRMs show limitations in reasoning skills for simpler strategic tasks, highlighting gaps in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes computational methods to identify unreliable narrators in texts, presenting a new dataset (TUNa) and evaluating various AI models for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting unreliable narrators, who unintentionally misrepresent information, and to bridge a gap between literary theory and AI applications.

Method: Creating a human-annotated dataset (TUNa) from diverse narrative sources and using various LLM training techniques to classify different types of narrator unreliability.

Result: The task of identifying unreliable narrators proved challenging, with LLMs showing potential but struggling with certain aspects.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the difficulty of unreliable narrator identification, encourages further exploration, and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

### [46] [ToxSyn-PT: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for Hate Speech Detection in Portuguese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10245)
*Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Fernanda Bufon Färber,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT is a Portuguese dataset for hate-speech classification across 9 minority groups, featuring large-scale synthetic sentences designed with a novel 4-stage pipeline for stylistic diversity and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate-speech datasets for Portuguese lack fine-grained classification and stylistic diversity, and are often tied to the social-media domain.

Method: The dataset was created using a four-stage pipeline: (1) manual seed curation, (2) few-shot text generation using an instruction-tuned LLM, (3) paraphrase-based augmentation, and (4) enrichment with additional neutral texts to prevent overfitting.

Result: ToxSyn-PT demonstrated strong generalization to both binary and multi-label classification tasks, performing well across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, despite domain differences.

Conclusion: The public release of ToxSyn-PT aims to advance research on synthetic data usage and fine-grained hate-speech detection in low-resource languages, enabling better tools for addressing hate speech across diverse domains.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [47] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines whether large language models exhibit probabilistic decision-making or deterministic patterns, challenging earlier assumptions and proposing a method to mitigate false priors in Gibbs sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research assumed that language models simulate probabilistic decision-making, akin to humans, to infer their priors, while this paper aims to reassess those assumptions.

Method: The authors analyzed decision patterns across various large language models under controlled Gibbs sampling, proposing a way to discern deterministic from stochastic behavior.

Result: Certain language models demonstrate deterministic behavior even with non-zero sampling temperature, thus contradicting the probabilistic sampling assumption.

Conclusion: The findings challenge earlier assumptions about probabilistic decision-making in language models, proposing techniques to avoid the inference of misleading priors and improve understanding of these models' behavior.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

### [48] [ClusterUCB: Efficient Gradient-Based Data Selection for Targeted Fine-Tuning of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10288)
*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClusterUCB, an efficient gradient-based data selection method using clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based data selection approaches for fine-tuning large language models require excessive computational resources, making them impractical.

Method: The authors cluster the training data based on gradient similarity and use the modified UCB algorithm to address data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem. Historical data influence informs decision-making, and cold start balances exploration and exploitation.

Result: The proposed ClusterUCB achieves similar performance to traditional gradient-based data selection methods while significantly lowering computational costs.

Conclusion: The ClusterUCB framework offers an efficient alternative for data selection in model fine-tuning, making gradient-based methods more resource-efficient without compromising performance.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [49] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick is a method for few-label text classification in low-resource contexts, focusing on refining pseudo-labels using efficient clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of few-label text classification in low-resource settings while overcoming noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation struggles.

Method: Flick introduces a pseudo-label refinement process using single-cluster cohesion and an adaptive top-k selection mechanism to distill high-confidence labels.

Result: Flick showed superior performance across 14 datasets, including linguistically diverse and low-resource languages like Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana.

Conclusion: Flick offers a robust and simple approach to enhance the quality of pseudo-labels, enabling effective fine-tuning of language models even in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [50] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study assesses how user input influences Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational scenarios, showing that incorrect suggestions reduce model accuracy while correct ones improve it, especially in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by concerns about sycophantic behavior in LLMs, where they adapt answers based on user-provided suggestions, potentially compromising educational equity.

Method: Testing five LLMs (from OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 classes) in five experimental conditions, researchers evaluated model response quality based on whether students provided correct or incorrect hints.

Result: Incorrect student suggestions degraded model accuracy by 15% while correct suggestions enhanced it similarly; smaller models showed stronger biases, with effects reaching 30% in GPT-4.1-nano compared to 8% in GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that sycophancy in LLMs can either support or hinder learning, emphasizing the need to address these biases to ensure fairness and quality in educational applications.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

### [51] [Scheduled Interleaved Speech-Text Training for Speech-to-Speech Translation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10299)
*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) by using interleaved speech-text training to address challenges in adapting large language models (LLMs) to the speech modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods for S2ST face difficulties due to the lack of speech-specific training data, making modality adaptation from text to speech a challenge.

Method: The authors introduce a scheduled interleaved speech-text training process that interleaves text tokens with speech units at the word level and progressively reduces the proportion of text during training.

Result: Experimental evaluations using LLaMA3.2-1B and the CVSS dataset demonstrate that this method improves S2ST translation performances, especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: Interleaved speech-text training is effective in addressing modality adaptation challenges in S2ST tasks and enhances performance across diverse languages.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) improve reasoning capabilities through program-execution-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, eliminating reliance on error-prone annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) by providing reliable and accurate chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, overcoming challenges with costly human annotations and error-prone generation.

Method: Extract step-by-step reasoning traces from deterministic program execution and convert them into natural language chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets, creating a scalable and verifiable supervision approach.

Result: LLMs trained using this method demonstrate transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks, while reducing inference token length and minimizing unproductive repetition.

Conclusion: Program-execution-driven CoT supervision is a scalable, effective strategy for improving LLM reasoning capabilities and generating high-quality datasets without dependency on human or unreliable synthetic annotations.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

*Xiaohan Yu,Pu Jian,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableRAG addresses the limitations of existing RAG methods by handling heterogeneous documents containing text and tables more effectively, showing state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG approaches struggle to deal with documents containing both textual and tabular components, leading to disrupted tabular structures, information loss, and weak reasoning capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces TableRAG, which uses context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and execution, and compositional answer generation to unify textual and tabular data processing.

Result: TableRAG outperforms baselines on both public datasets and the newly developed HeteQA benchmark, demonstrating superior multi-hop reasoning for heterogeneous documents.

Conclusion: TableRAG successfully advances question answering on heterogeneous documents by combining textual and tabular understanding in a unified framework, establishing a new benchmark standard for the task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

### [54] [PAG: Multi-Turn Reinforced LLM Self-Correction with Policy as Generative Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10406)
*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a reinforcement learning framework where large language models self-correct their outputs by alternating between policy and verification roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to reliably verify their own outputs, and existing solutions involve separate models or complicated training pipelines that limit scalability.

Method: The PAG framework uses a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning paradigm where the model alternates between generating answers (policy role) and evaluating its own correctness (verifier role), revising answers only when errors are detected.

Result: Experiments show PAG improves both reasoning and verification abilities, enhancing generation accuracy and outperforming self-consistency verification methods.

Conclusion: PAG effectively resolves verification challenges in large language models, offering a scalable and performance-enhancing solution to improve reasoning and output correctness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the TempVS benchmark to test temporal reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using three task types. Models perform significantly worse than humans on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate the temporal reasoning and grounding abilities of MLLMs in understanding image sequences and integrating visual and linguistic information.

Method: The authors developed the TempVS benchmark, incorporating tests on event relation inference, sentence ordering, and image ordering, complemented by a grounding test, to evaluate MLLM performance.

Result: 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs were assessed, revealing a significant performance gap compared to human abilities in temporal understanding.

Conclusion: MLLMs struggle with temporal reasoning tasks involving both visual and linguistic input, highlighting the need for further research and model improvement in this area.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

*Avneet Kaur,Arnav Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how news media framing during the Israel-Palestine conflict influences readers, uncovering biases and emphasizing war over peace through computational analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: News media framing can exacerbate conflicts, and understanding its dynamics in conflict topics like Israel-Palestine is critical but limited by the current inability to go beyond surface-level analyses.

Method: The authors employed computational techniques combining frame semantics and large language models to analyze indicators of war and peace journalism in a corpus of news articles.

Result: Their findings indicate a predominant focus on war journalism over peace journalism, with evident biases in framing assailants and victims based on regional reporting differences (US, UK, Middle East).

Conclusion: Media coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict reflects significant biases in framing, emphasizing war-centric narratives and varying drastically based on regional outlets.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize LLM reasoning by balancing conciseness and complexity, achieving enhanced performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often generate long outputs and apply uniform penalties without considering problem complexity, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy.

Method: The authors proposed a divided reward function with a novel penalty for output length to manage reasoning efficiency in LLMs.

Result: The approach shortened outputs while maintaining accuracy for simpler datasets (GSM8K, MATH500) and achieved improved accuracy on a complex dataset (AIME2024).

Conclusion: The strategy of tailoring LLM reasoning based on problem complexity leads to both efficiency and accuracy gains, showcasing the importance of context-aware optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Motivation: To improve scientific claim verification models by making their reasoning process more interpretable and faithful, as label prediction alone offers limited insights.

Method: The authors extend the SciTab benchmark with human annotations identifying minimal table cells essential for claims, propose a taxonomy for ambiguous cases, and conduct experiments evaluating the impact of table alignment on performance.

Result: Findings show that adding table-cell alignment improves claim verification accuracy, but large language models often fail to align with human reasoning despite predicting correct labels.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of reasoning fidelity and interpretability in scientific claim verification, suggesting room for improvement in current models.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Tina model family demonstrates that strong reasoning performance can be achieved in language models at significantly reduced costs by using parameter-efficient reinforcement learning and low-rank adaptations, applied to a small 1.5B parameter base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning abilities in language models can be achieved cost-effectively and to improve performance at minimal computational and financial expenditures.

Method: The approach employs parameter-efficient RL updates using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a small base model with 1.5 billion parameters, producing reasoning models that are cost-efficient and competitive in performance.

Result: Tina achieved a >20% increase in reasoning performance and 43.33% Pass@1 accuracy on the AIME24 dataset, all at a post-training cost of just $9 USD, representing a 260x cost reduction compared to SOTA models.

Conclusion: The study highlights that parameter-efficient RL with LoRA can rapidly adapt models for reasoning tasks at minimal cost. The approach preserves the base model's knowledge while achieving robust performance, and all resources are open-sourced for accessibility.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

### [60] [Surface Fairness, Deep Bias: A Comparative Study of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10491)
*Aleksandra Sorokovikova,Pavel Chizhov,Iuliia Eremenko,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates bias in large language models (LLMs), finding notable biases in tasks like grading answers and giving advice, especially under user personalization scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores the presence of biases in modern language models, which are trained on data containing controversial and stereotypical content, raising concerns over fairness and ethical implications.

Method: Bias was analyzed using various proxy measures. Experiments included pre-prompted personae evaluations on a benchmark (MMLU), reformulated task analysis, and salary negotiation advice scenarios.

Result: Negligible differences in scores were found with pre-prompted personae, but significant biases emerged when models graded user answers or gave salary negotiation advice.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs persists, particularly in personalized and contextualized scenarios, which becomes more concerning as models are increasingly designed for user personalization and memory.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

### [61] [Resa: Transparent Reasoning Models via SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09967)
*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Deqing Fu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Resa introduces efficient sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) for language models, significantly reducing costs and training time while preserving reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to find cost-efficient ways to enhance reasoning abilities in language models by leveraging their underlying representations.

Method: A sparse autoencoder (SAE) is trained to extract reasoning from a source model and used in supervised fine-tuning to transfer abilities to a target model. The approach relies on verified question-answer data without reasoning traces.

Result: SAE-Tuning retains over 97% reasoning performance of RL-trained models while cutting training costs by over 2000x and time by over 450x. Generalizable and modular reasoning abilities are achieved.

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning proves to be an efficient method for eliciting reasoning, offering generality and modularity, all at significantly lower costs. Open-source artifacts validate its efficacy.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) in multi-user dialogue state tracking (DST) and uncovers their limitations in handling multi-user conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most conventional DST benchmarks focus on linear user-agent dialogues, ignoring the complexity of real-world multi-user interactions.

Method: The researchers generate multi-user conversation data by systematically integrating a second user's utterances into an existing DST dataset using speech act theory.

Result: Experimental results show a significant performance drop in LLMs when tasked with multi-user DST compared to single-user scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the shortcomings of current LLMs in multi-user DST and emphasizes the need for improved models to tackle multi-speaker environments effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

### [63] [Reliable Reasoning Path: Distilling Effective Guidance for LLM Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10508)
*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Bo Li,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RRP framework to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging knowledge graphs. It focuses on mining effective reasoning paths while addressing challenges like graph complexity and redundant paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks because of insufficient factual knowledge and hallucinations. The authors aim to address this by integrating knowledge graphs and refining logical reasoning paths to improve LLM performance.

Method: The RRP framework combines LLM semantic understanding with relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning to extract high-quality reasoning paths from knowledge graphs. It uses a rethinking module to evaluate and refine the logical consistency of these paths.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that RRP delivers state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods, while being adaptable for integration with various LLMs.

Conclusion: RRP enhances LLM reasoning capabilities by generating tailored, high-quality reasoning paths for specific questions, offering a plug-and-play solution to improve LLM effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method to reconstruct ancestral word forms (protoforms) using a hybrid model of statistical inference and linguistically inspired rules, achieving improvements in accuracy and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing probabilistic models for protoform reconstruction, which rely heavily on data-driven approaches without incorporating linguistic constraints.

Method: The proposed method combines data-driven inference and rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework to balance statistical patterns and linguistic constraints.

Result: The approach achieved substantial improvements compared to baseline models in reconstructing Latin protoforms, evaluated on accuracy and phonological plausibility using Romance language datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating statistical inference with linguistic heuristics enhances the reconstruction of ancestral word forms, showcasing the potential of hybrid models in linguistic applications.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve AI-powered tutors by accurately assessing their ability to identify mistakes in student mathematical reasoning, ensuring effective pedagogical feedback.

Method: The paper explores four approaches: ensemble models using embeddings, a sentence-transformer classifier, a history-aware attention-based model, and a retrieval-augmented large language model prompting system.

Result: The final system, which combines example-driven retrieval and structured prompts with large language model reasoning, surpasses all baseline methods in performance.

Conclusion: Combining example-driven retrieval with large language model reasoning is an effective method for evaluating pedagogical feedback in AI tutors.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) process and represent character-level information during spelling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit high accuracy for simple spelling tasks but struggle with complex character-level processes. The study seeks to understand how LLMs represent and process character-level information internally.

Method: The authors analyze character-level encoding in LLMs using three approaches: probing classifiers to evaluate learned representations, identifying knowledge neurons involved in character-level tasks, and inspecting attention weights for patterns during the spelling process.

Result: The study reveals that the embedding layer of LLMs does not fully capture character-level information beyond the first character. LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct this knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs handle spelling tasks differently from humans. Intermediate and higher layers of the Transformer play a critical role in overcoming deficiencies in initial character-level representation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

TL;DR: The paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) to detect life-threatening language, comparing their performance with traditional methods. LLMs (especially Mistral and Llama-2) outperform traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to safeguard individuals by effectively detecting life-threatening language, promoting mental health and preventing harm.

Method: The study fine-tunes three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2) on datasets with varying balance scenarios, compares LLMs to traditional methods, and employs upsampling for imbalanced datasets.

Result: LLMs, particularly Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods in detecting life-threatening texts across balanced and imbalanced datasets. Upsampling aids traditional methods but has less effect on LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs show great potential for detecting life-threatening language in real-world applications, outperforming traditional methods and maintaining strong results regardless of data balance.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Motivation: To address the missing hypernymy links involving adjectives in the resource of Open English Wordnet, which is essential for linguistic linked open data.

Method: The authors analyze the nature of hypernymy for adjectives compared to nouns and verbs, create a new resource, and adapt the TaxoLLama methodology using fine-tuned large language models.

Result: The research demonstrates the feasibility of using fine-tuned large language models to predict adjective hypernymy effectively.

Conclusion: Hypernymy for adjectives can be systematically established using the proposed approach, improving the quality and utility of the Open English Wordnet.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of

*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREMISE, a prompt-based framework for reducing verbose reasoning traces in large reasoning models (LRMs) without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models produce verbose reasoning traces, leading to high computational cost and inefficiency, which hinders their deployment in latency-sensitive environments.

Method: The authors propose PREMISE, a framework combining trace diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundancy in reasoning while maintaining performance, using multi-objective textual search.

Result: The method achieves baseline or better accuracy on GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 with up to 87.5% reduction in reasoning tokens and cost savings of 69-82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a scalable and practical solution for efficient inference in large reasoning models without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ClaimSpect, a method for analyzing complex claims by deconstructing them into hierarchical aspects and perspectives using retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of evaluating nuanced claims, which cannot always be labeled as simply 'true' or 'false.' By breaking such claims into distinct aspects and sub-aspects, they believe it becomes easier to validate and provide well-rounded insights.

Method: The proposed approach, ClaimSpect, creates a hierarchical structure of claim aspects with corpus-specific perspectives. It divides corpora into relevant segments to identify new sub-aspects and varying views (support, neutral, oppose) and their prevalence using retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: The application of ClaimSpect to scientific and political claims demonstrated its robustness and accuracy in breaking down complex claims and representing corpus perspectives. A dedicated dataset and human evaluation validated its effectiveness against baselines.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect offers a systematic and structured way of analyzing nuanced claims, successfully providing multifaceted insights through aspect hierarchies and corpus-respective perspectives, with robust performance through studies and evaluations.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaxoAdapt, a framework for adapting large language model-generated taxonomies dynamically to specific scientific corpora while addressing challenges posed by evolving fields and multidimensional contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in organizing and retrieving scientific literature due to the time-consuming process of expert-curated taxonomies and shortcomings in automatic taxonomy construction methods such as lack of generalizability and inability to capture the multidimensional nature of research papers.

Method: TaxoAdapt employs iterative hierarchical classification to dynamically adapt and expand taxonomies generated by LLMs based on the topical distribution of a given corpus. It is a multidimensional approach considering various aspects of scientific contributions.

Result: TaxoAdapt significantly improves taxonomy construction by creating taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than existing methods across diverse computer science conferences.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for structuring scientific fields, addressing their multidimensional nature, and dynamically adapting to evolving domains, thus offering an efficient and effective alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: Multilingual LLMs face challenges in adapting to new languages due to limited capacity, scarce data, and inadequate tokenizer coverage.

Method: The authors propose designing a universal tokenizer pre-trained on a broader range of languages than those used in primary LLM pretraining.

Result: Systematic experiments demonstrate that universal tokenizers improve language adaptation by up to 20.2% in win rates for included languages and a 5% gain for completely unseen languages.

Conclusion: Universal tokenizers enable better multilingual adaptability post-training with minimal compromise to pretraining language performance.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

*Alberto Testoni,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates uncertainty estimation methods for clinical question answering using LLMs across various specialties and question types, proposing lightweight, single-pass estimators as effective alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical need for accurate uncertainty estimates in deploying LLMs for high-stakes tasks like clinical decision support.

Method: The authors evaluate ten open-source LLMs on clinical datasets, comparing standard methods and introducing simpler, single-pass estimators based on reasoning traces.

Result: The lightweight single-pass methods perform comparably to Semantic Entropy, with significant variability observed across specialties and question types.

Conclusion: Selecting models based on both specific question characteristics and model strengths is vital for effective clinical decision support.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

*Viet Anh Trinh,Xinlu He,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism to reduce named entity errors in automatic speech recognition (ASR) using a large language model (LLM). It reports a 30% reduction in word error rate (WER) for named entities on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are critical in ASR but are prone to high misrecognition rates, severely affecting downstream applications.

Method: The authors use an LLM-based revision mechanism that incorporates reasoning abilities along with context information, such as lecture notes featuring correct named entities.

Result: The method shows up to 30% relative reduction in WER for named entities in the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, a newly introduced resource with 45 hours of MIT course data.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM reasoning abilities and contextual data improves ASR accuracy for named entities, enhancing overall system reliability for critical applications.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit addresses the problem of updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs without compromising their consistency and effectiveness across languages. It introduces a language-specific parameter update mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs while preventing both destructive parameter interference and degradation in multilingual generalization.

Method: LangEdit employs a null-space constrained mechanism that projects parameter updates for each language onto orthogonal subspaces. This scientifically ensures update independence and maintains the model's multilingual generalization abilities.

Result: Evaluations showcase LangEdit's superior performance across three architectures, six languages, and four tasks, demonstrating reduced parameter interference and improved knowledge editing accuracy versus existing methods.

Conclusion: LangEdit proves to be an efficient and accurate framework for multilingual updates in LLMs, with its approach addressing both destructive interference and preserving multilingual consistency.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReCUT, a novel approach to reduce reasoning trace length in LLMs without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques improve LLM reasoning but often lead to overthinking and redundant traces, necessitating methods to optimize reasoning efficiency.

Method: ReCUT employs stepwise exploration and long-short switched sampling strategies to create diverse reasoning paths. Preference pairs are then used to train two specialized Gemini LLMs for accuracy and brevity, and their parameters are interpolated into a final integrated model.

Result: Experiments show that ReCUT reduces reasoning lengths by 30-50% while maintaining or improving accuracy across various datasets and models.

Conclusion: ReCUT effectively balances reasoning length and accuracy, addressing overthinking in CoT-prompted LLMs, with broader implications for improving reasoning efficiency in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes how self-supervised speech models like Wav2Vec2 represent linguistic information across different languages and shows that learned structures are mostly language-independent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether and how wav2vec2 models encode language-matched and non-matched speech information, addressing a gap in prior research focused predominantly on English.

Method: Probing classifiers and geometric analyses were used to study the representation of phones, lexical tones, and speaker information across models pre-trained on different languages.

Result: The study found that phone, tone, and speaker subspaces are largely orthogonal across languages, with matched-language data offering small gains in phone and tone representation in later layers, but no gains for speaker information.

Conclusion: Wav2Vec2's learned representations are largely universal and not strongly dependent on the specific speech data or language used during pretraining.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical dialogue systems face issues with identifying relevant medical knowledge and generating accurate, personalized responses.

Method: The paper introduces MedRef, which refines medical knowledge and utilizes dynamic prompt adjustments through modules like Triplet Filter and Demo Selector to enhance interaction.

Result: MedRef outperforms existing methods on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks in both response quality and the accuracy of medical entities.

Conclusion: MedRef proves effective and reliable for real-world medical applications, addressing prior limitations in the field.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and validate the effectiveness of fine-tuning methods on large language models while optimizing resource consumption.

Method: Evaluation of large language model performance using fine-tuning with LoRA and QLoRA across specified reasoning and knowledge domains.

Result: LoRA-based fine-tuning enhances task-specific performance and computational efficiency, with performance relying on alignment between datasets and benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: LoRA methods are effective for resource-efficient LLM adaptation and offer practical insights for developers with constraints on computational resources.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve

parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a behavior called out-of-context reasoning (OCR), allowing them to generalize new facts and hallucinate false information. Researchers analyzed this phenomenon through experiments and theoretical modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why LLMs demonstrate both remarkable generalization capabilities and susceptibility to hallucinations when exposed to new knowledge during fine-tuning.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments across five LLMs to verify the OCR mechanism and created a synthetic factual recall task to model this behavior theoretically. They analyzed model structures, focusing on matrix factorization and implicit biases in gradient descent.

Result: The experiments confirmed OCR drives both generalization and hallucination, with causality depending on concept associations. Simple transformer models with matrix factorization performed better in solving OCR tasks, supporting the hypothesis.

Conclusion: OCR is rooted in the implicit bias of gradient descent and matrix factorization, explaining the sample efficiency and behavior of LLMs while offering insights into mitigating undesirable effects in knowledge injection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: The study introduces BioClinical ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder for biomedical and clinical NLP, which outperforms existing models on diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder-based transformer models in biomedical NLP face domain adaptation challenges, limiting progress despite their potential for structured information extraction.

Method: The paper presents BioClinical ModernBERT, designed through continued pretraining on over 53.5 billion tokens and leveraging diverse datasets from multiple institutions and regions.

Result: BioClinical ModernBERT achieves higher performance compared to existing encoders across four downstream biomedical tasks.

Conclusion: The release of BioClinical ModernBERT, in base and large versions, facilitates advancements in biomedical NLP by addressing domain-specific limitations.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automatic method for evaluating the translation of natural language mathematical statements into formal mathematical language, using an ensemble of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automating the evaluation process for translating mathematical statements arises from the increasing complexity of statements and the significant time and expertise human evaluations require.

Method: The authors introduce an "epistemically and formally grounded" (EFG) ensemble of LLM judges. These judges evaluate autoformalization tasks using specific criteria: logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.

Result: Experiments reveal that the EFG ensemble correlates more strongly with human assessments compared to generic evaluation methods, particularly when assessing formal qualities.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential for scalable, interpretable, and reliable automated evaluation of formal mathematical reasoning, paving the way for improved LLM applications in this domain.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

TL;DR: Magistral is a new reasoning model built with an in-house RL pipeline, prioritizing independence from pre-existing resources and proving the feasibility of pure RL training for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an independent framework for training reasoning-capable LLMs using reinforcement learning, avoiding reliance on previous models or RL traces.

Method: The paper developed its own scalable RL pipeline, implementing a ground-up approach to train LLMs, with a focus on reasoning, multimodal understanding, and instruction-following capabilities.

Result: The approach led to the development of Magistral Medium and Magistral Small, with models that exhibit robust reasoning and maintain initial capabilities of the checkpoint while improving instruction and multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the effectiveness of a purely RL-based training pipeline for LLMs and contributes to the open-source community with the release of Magistral Small.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable
reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing
implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data
from Magistral Medium.

*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to identify interpretable features in LLMs, outperforming existing approaches in causal evaluations and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing techniques, such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which struggle in causal evaluations and lack ties to model computations when analyzing interpretable features in LLMs.

Method: The proposed method uses semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations into sparse and interpretable features that are directly mapped to their activating inputs.

Result: SNMF outperforms SAEs and a supervised baseline in causal evaluations and better aligns with human-interpretable concepts, revealing reusable neuron combinations and hierarchical structures in the MLP activation space.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple and effective approach for discovering interpretable features and understanding concept representations in large language models.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the concept of epistemic friction—resistance in updating beliefs—and introduces a framework to model it using Dynamic Epistemic Logic in human-AI dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how belief updates occur in human-AI collaborations and analyze the importance of epistemic friction, which is often neglected in aligning LLMs with human preferences.

Method: The study employs Dynamic Epistemic Logic as a theoretical framework and explores belief revision dynamics in situated human-AI collaborative tasks.

Result: The model successfully predicts belief updates, and insights are obtained into how epistemic resistance impacts belief alignment during collaboration.

Conclusion: Epistemic friction offers a critical perspective for improving belief alignment and collaborative dialogue dynamics, enabling more sophisticated handling of complex belief scenarios.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

TL;DR: Domain2Vec introduces a method to represent datasets as domain vectors and optimize data mixture for pretraining language models under the assumption that aligned data distributions yield better validation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of language model pretraining by addressing challenges related to dataset selection and domain alignment.

Method: Domain2Vec leverages meta-domains and domain vectors, using a classifier to decompose datasets. It identifies optimal data mixtures in a training-free manner guided by the Distribution Alignment Assumption.

Result: Domain2Vec reduces computation by 51.5% while achieving the same validation loss on Pile-CC, and improves downstream performance by an average of 2.83% under equivalent compute budgets.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec enhances scalability and performance of language models by optimizing data mixtures and improving training efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

*Kangwei Liu,Siyuan Cheng,Bozhong Tian,Xiaozhuan Liang,Yuyang Yin,Meng Han,Ningyu Zhang,Bryan Hooi,Xi Chen,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a professionally annotated benchmark for detecting harmful content in Chinese using real-world data, along with a knowledge-augmented baseline method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are effective at detecting harmful content, resources for non-English languages like Chinese are limited, creating a need for comprehensive benchmarks.

Method: The authors created a benchmark dataset with six categories of harmful content from real-world Chinese data, annotated professionally, and supplemented it with a rule base of explicit expert knowledge.

Result: The knowledge-augmented baseline allows smaller models to perform comparably to state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The study advances Chinese harmful content detection through a novel benchmark and method, bridging gaps in resource availability and performance for smaller models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind introduces an adaptive LLM-agent framework addressing deficiencies in automating the machine learning pipeline through expert knowledge grounding, strategic solution exploration, and dynamic coding strategies. It outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-agent frameworks struggle with complex data science tasks due to rigid workflows and lack of empirical expertise, limiting their performance to simple problems.

Method: AutoMind employs a curated expert knowledge base, knowledgeable tree search algorithm for solution exploration, and a self-adaptive coding strategy tailored to task complexities.

Result: AutoMind outperformed state-of-the-art baselines on two automated data science benchmarks, showcasing improvements in effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advancement in automated data science, demonstrating its ability to handle complex tasks more robustly and efficiently than existing frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

### [91] [How Well Can Reasoning Models Identify and Recover from Unhelpful Thoughts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979)
*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores reasoning models' capacity to self-reevaluate and recover from unhelpful thoughts affecting their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning models can identify and recover from common reasoning pitfalls, aiming to improve model accuracy and safety.

Method: The authors injected four types of unhelpful thoughts into reasoning models to assess their ability to identify and recover from these issues.

Result: While models succeeded in detecting unhelpful thoughts, they struggled to recover from them, with larger models performing worse than smaller ones in recovery tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning models exhibit limited meta-cognitive abilities for self-reevaluation, necessitating improvements for enhanced reasoning and safer AI systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

*Qingyan Wei,Yaojie Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlowFast Sampling proposes a dynamic method for token generation in diffusion-based language models (dLLMs), achieving significant speedups and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dLLM sampling strategies show inefficiencies and limited flexibility, prompting the need for a more dynamic approach.

Method: The paper introduces SlowFast Sampling, a strategy guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles, alongside dLLM-Cache integration to optimize computation.

Result: SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63× speedup with minimal accuracy drop and up to 34.22× speedup with caching, outperforming strong autoregressive model baselines.

Conclusion: Dynamic sampling strategies like SlowFast Sampling significantly enhance the efficiency and potential of dLLMs for fast, high-quality token generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mask-driven LoRA tuning method for flexible and efficient video editing using pre-trained Image-to-Video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods using diffusion models either rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting adaptability, or offer limited control over video frames beyond the first frame.

Method: The authors propose a mask-based LoRA tuning method that adapts pre-trained Image-to-Video models for flexible editing by using spatial masks. These masks ensure region-specific learning, where the input video guides spatial structure and motion, and reference images provide appearance cues.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves superior editing performance compared to state-of-the-art video editing techniques.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible, efficient, and adaptable solution for video editing, allowing controllable edits across frames and preserving background regions without altering the model architecture.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse introduces a vision architecture inspired by algorithmic search strategies, achieving strong image classification performance with structured feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether classical algorithmic search principles can introduce a more structured, interpretable, and reasoning-like process for creating visual representations in neural networks.

Method: DeepTraverse integrates recursive exploration modules for deep feature analysis and adaptive calibration modules for dynamic feature adjustment based on global context, achieving systematic refinement and efficiency.

Result: DeepTraverse demonstrates highly competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination across diverse benchmarks, surpassing some conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts.

Conclusion: Integrating algorithmic priors like search strategies can build more efficient and performant vision backbones, as exemplified by the success of DeepTraverse.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for progress estimation models that can adapt to diverse, out-of-distribution tasks and environments without relying solely on training data.

Method: The paper applies gradient-based meta-learning on expert visual trajectories paired with natural language task descriptions, enabling semantic-focused progress estimation during test-time adaptation.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art in-context learning approaches with autoregressive vision-language models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective generalization capabilities, adapting to diverse tasks, environments, and embodiments beyond the training setup.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation
model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories
by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a
gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is a framework to significantly accelerate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by addressing redundancies holistically without the need for retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models offer significant promise for embodied intelligence but face challenges due to computational and memory inefficiencies during inference.

Method: EfficientVLA employs three strategies: (1) pruning redundant layers in the language module, (2) optimizing visual tokens for task relevance, and (3) caching intermediate features in the action head to reduce redundancies.

Result: EfficientVLA improves inference speed by 1.93X, reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, and achieves performance with only a 0.6% drop in success rate.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA effectively balances efficiency and performance, making practical deployment of VLA models more feasible.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ICCWD dataset, a multi-modal benchmark dataset with 10,000 manually labeled image-caption pairs, to improve machine learning tools for detecting content depicting minors. Initial benchmarking indicates child detection remains a difficult task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identified a lack of existing datasets or benchmarks for detecting digital content depicting minors in a multi-modal context, which is critical due to legal and platform-specific regulations and the reliance on machine learning for such detection.

Method: The authors developed and released the ICCWD dataset, consisting of 10,000 image-caption pairs manually labeled for the presence or absence of minors. They benchmarked this dataset using three different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system.

Result: Benchmarking on the dataset showed that child detection is a challenging task, with the best-performing method achieving a true positive rate of only 75.3%.

Conclusion: The ICCWD dataset fills a critical gap in the development of tools for detecting minors in digital content. Its release is expected to foster improvements in minor detection methods across various scenarios.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Motivation: To explore and improve automated medical image classification, particularly for identifying psoriasis and similar lesions.

Method: Pre-trained CNNs and Vision Transformers on ImageNet were adapted to the specific medical dataset for performance comparison.

Result: The Vision Transformer DaViT-B outperformed all models with an f1-score of 96.4% in classifying psoriasis efficiently.

Conclusion: Vision Transformers offer superior performance over CNNs for medical image classification, with DaViT-B as the recommended architecture for psoriasis detection.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViCrit, a reinforcement learning task that improves vision-language models (VLMs) by training them to detect subtle alterations in human-written image captions, leading to performance gains across multiple visual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of vision-centric tasks that are both challenging and unambiguously verifiable for fine-tuning vision-language models.

Method: ViCrit trains VLMs by injecting subtle hallucinations in image captions and tasks the models with pinpointing the altered span, providing an exact-match binary reward for unambiguous evaluation.

Result: Models trained with ViCrit demonstrate substantial improvements in various vision-language benchmarks, including the ability to generalize to abstract images and visual math scenarios.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism emerges as a generalizable and effective objective for advancing visual perception in VLMs, as validated by a novel diagnostic benchmark introduced in this study.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoCA, a framework for improving cross-domain robustness in end-to-end autonomous driving, achieving strong generalization and adaptation performance without incurring high computational or retraining costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving models face challenges in cross-domain deployment due to limited generalization performance and the high costs associated with domain adaptation.

Method: RoCA uses a Gaussian process to model joint probabilistic distributions over encoded tokens, learning basis tokens and trajectories spanning diverse scenarios. This enables probabilistic inference of trajectories in new domains and strengthens the generalizability of base models during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate RoCA's significant improvement in cross-domain generalization and adaptation performance compared to direct finetuning approaches.

Conclusion: RoCA enhances the practicality of end-to-end autonomous driving by enabling robust cross-domain adaptation and generalization, making deployment across various domains feasible and efficient.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARKE, a scalable method for enhancing diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models using conditional entropy while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining sufficient diversity in prompt-guided diffusion model outputs, especially when prompts cover a wide semantic range.

Method: The proposed SPARKE method offers prompt-aware diversity guidance through conditional entropy and the Conditional latent RKE Score. This reduces computational complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$ for large-scale generation.

Result: SPARKE numerically improved prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion model outputs, enabling efficient sampling over many rounds with different prompts.

Conclusion: SPARKE enhances diversity in diffusion models effectively and efficiently. The method is accessible via a released codebase.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [103] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an attention-based SSR retrieval model, leveraging satellite imagery and temporal-spatial analysis to overcome limitations of existing methods in mountainous regions with dynamic snow cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current operational algorithms inadequately address surface reflectance estimation in regions with frequent changes, like mountainous terrains, due to reliance on monthly statistics.

Method: The approach utilizes an attention-based Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer model trained on SSR estimates, focusing on raw satellite image sequences and eliminating reliance on hand-crafted features.

Result: The proposed model achieves performance comparable to albedo-informed models, effectively learning latent surface reflectance dynamics, especially in complex terrains.

Conclusion: The model offers improved SSR retrieval accuracy for challenging terrains, demonstrating the ability to generalize across diverse landscapes through latent reflectance learning.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

*Bill Psomas,Dionysis Christopoulos,Eirini Baltzi,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou,Tilemachos Aravanis,Nikos Komodakis,Konstantinos Karantzalos,Yannis Avrithis,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Standard linear probing inadequately evaluates models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM) due to their distributed patch-token nature, motivating the need for a more efficient attentive probing method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from the inadequacies of standard linear probing to effectively evaluate MIM-trained models and the inefficiency issues with current attentive probing methods.

Method: The paper introduces efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that reduces redundant projections, decreases trainable parameters, and enhances computational efficiency.

Result: Efficient probing (EP) achieves up to a 10× speed-up over conventional multi-head attention, outperforms previous approaches across seven benchmarks, and generalizes well to diverse pre-training paradigms.

Conclusion: EP offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative to existing probing methods, improving evaluation outcomes for SSL models while ensuring broader generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a method for personalized vision-language retrieval using low-rank adaptation in the language encoder, achieving significant gains over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of learning new concepts from limited data and combining personal knowledge with general knowledge in retrieval systems.

Method: Regularized low-rank adaptation of parameters in the final language encoder layer, combined with parameter addition for multiple learned concepts.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art performance on DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi benchmarks, improving personal retrieval accuracy by 4%-22%.

Conclusion: Low-rank adaptation in vision-language models is an effective approach for personalized retrieval, balancing new concept learning and general knowledge preservation.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreMix introduces a data augmentation strategy using diffusion models to enhance discriminator performance, particularly when labeled data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective methods to improve discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data, without relying on extensive dataset collections or parameter tuning.

Method: The paper leverages the score compositional properties of diffusion models by mixing scores from different class-conditioned trajectories to create synthetic and challenging samples during diffusion sampling.

Result: Performance gains are observed when mixing distant classes in the discriminator's embedding space rather than close classes in the generator's condition space. Additionally, empirical findings show minimal correlation between the generator's learned condition space and the discriminator's embedding space.

Conclusion: ScoreMix effectively boosts the training of discriminative models, achieving notable performance improvements while reducing reliance on large datasets and exhaustive parameter searches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

*Hamid Kamangir,Mona Hajiesmaeeli,Mason Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a crop yield benchmark dataset for California that integrates various data sources and proposes a multi-modal deep learning model for accurate yield forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive yield data, accurate and timely crop yield forecasting in California remains challenging due to the interplay of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors.

Method: The study compiles a comprehensive dataset covering 70+ crops (2008-2022) and develops a customized multi-modal deep learning model using stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder.

Result: The proposed model achieved an R2 score of 0.76 on an unseen test dataset, demonstrating strong predictive performance across diverse agricultural regions.

Conclusion: This benchmark dataset and deep learning framework serve as a foundation for agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming, with all resources publicly accessible.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at
our GitHub repository.

### [108] [DySS: Dynamic Queries and State-Space Learning for Efficient 3D Object Detection from Multi-Camera Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10242)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DySS, a state-space learning model optimized for 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV), achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inefficiencies of dense BEV features and reduce computational expenses in query-based 3D object detection, particularly as it scales to larger datasets or multiple video frames.

Method: The proposed DySS model uses a state-space model (SSM) to process sampled features sequentially. Auxiliary tasks, such as future prediction and masked reconstruction, enhance the SSM training. Dynamic query operations (merge, remove, split) optimize query management across the network.

Result: DySS achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes test split, with 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP. On the validation split, it achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP while running at a real-time speed of 33 FPS.

Conclusion: DySS effectively combines state-space learning with dynamic queries to enable both efficient inference and superior performance in camera-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalLoc, a dataset and baseline model for efficient and probabilistic hallucination detection in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in vision-language models reduce reliability in critical applications, necessitating effective and efficient detection methods.

Method: HalLoc provides a 150K-token annotated dataset covering hallucination types across VQA, instruction-following, and image captioning. A lightweight baseline model enables real-time hallucination detection.

Result: HalLoc facilitates the creation of models for graded confidence hallucination detection and introduces a baseline concurrent detection model for integration into existing systems.

Conclusion: HalLoc and its baseline model improve the efficiency and accuracy of hallucination detection, enhancing trust in vision-language models.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep learning (DL) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) for reliable skin cancer diagnosis by comparing various models and UQ methods, achieving promising results with CLIP-based vision transformers paired with SVM and ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of skin cancer diagnosis using deep learning, addressing challenges like data scarcity and the lack of uncertainty awareness.

Method: The approach involved benchmarking pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, ResNet50) with traditional classifiers, and integrating uncertainty quantification techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensemble. Evaluations focused on classification accuracy and uncertainty-aware metrics.

Result: CLIP-based vision transformers, especially LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM, outperformed others in classification. Ensemble methods provided a balance between accuracy and handling uncertainty, with Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout excelling in sensitivity to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty quantification with deep learning models can enhance the performance and reliability of automated skin cancer diagnosis, making these systems more suited for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual generation of SOAP notes in clinical settings for documenting patient visits is time-consuming and contributes to clinician burnout, highlighting the need for scalable, automated solutions.

Method: The authors developed a weakly supervised multimodal framework that utilizes lesion images and sparse clinical text to automate the generation of SOAP notes, employing minimal manual annotations and introducing new evaluation metrics.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated comparable performance to advanced AI systems like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, based on newly introduced metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for automating SOAP note documentation in clinical care, potentially reducing clinician burden and minimizing dependence on extensive annotated data.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of research on AVQA in UGC-ODVs, a growing trend due to the popularity of the Metaverse and omnidirectional videos.

Method: The authors construct a dataset with 300 UGC omnidirectional videos captured by five individuals using two cameras across 10 scenes. They conduct a subjective AVQA experiment to obtain Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) and then develop a baseline AVQA model with modules for video and audio feature extraction and audio-visual fusion.

Result: The proposed AVQA baseline model demonstrates optimal performance on the new dataset, making it a significant contribution to the UGC-ODV AVQA field.

Conclusion: This study advances AVQA research in UGC-ODVs by providing a new dataset and an effective baseline model, paving the way for future research in this domain.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for recognizing students' academic emotions from facial expressions in online learning environments, indicating moderate model performance and some limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address limitations in traditional supervised machine learning approaches for analyzing academic emotions, aiming for broader generalization and less reliance on labeled datasets.

Method: Two Vision-Language Models, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, were applied to 5,000 images representing different emotions using zero-shot prompting.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperformed Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct in overall performance and in recognizing confused expressions. Both models were effective at identifying happy emotions but failed in detecting distracted behavior.

Conclusion: Vision-Language Models show promise for academic emotion analysis, especially in identifying confused expressions, though further performance improvements are needed to address their shortcomings.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced 3D Gaussian splatting technique for rendering scenes quickly and with high quality, even using sparse training views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods struggle with limited input views, leading to overfitting and reduced rendering quality.

Method: The framework utilizes a stereo foundation model for camera pose estimation and point cloud reconstruction, multiscale 2D feature aggregation for encoding color attributes, a point interaction network for enhanced representation, and lightweight MLPs for decoding Gaussian parameters.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates superior rendering quality compared to NeRF-based methods and competitive results under few-shot scenarios against other state-of-the-art 3DGS techniques.

Conclusion: The method addresses the limitations of existing 3DGS approaches, enabling real-time and high-quality rendering from sparse views while showcasing significant improvements in benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoCAD, a method for CAD generation that focuses on modifying local parts of CAD models following specific user-defined geometric instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods struggle with following textual instructions related to local parts while maintaining precision and usability.

Method: The authors propose a system, GeoCAD, which uses a captioning strategy (combining vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning) to generate detailed geometric instructions for local parts. The approach leverages LLMs during training and inference for accurate local geometry modifications.

Result: GeoCAD enables effective modification of local CAD parts as per user-defined geometric instructions, excelling in generation quality, validity, and consistency. They generated annotations for approximately 221k local CAD parts.

Conclusion: GeoCAD represents a significant advancement in local geometry-controllable CAD generation, addressing limitations of previous methods and providing a practical tool for designers.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

### [117] [RealKeyMorph: Keypoints in Real-world Coordinates for Resolution-agnostic Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10344)
*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic image registration method that avoids interpolation artifacts by operating in real-world coordinates, improving performance on medical image registration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning-based medical image registration methods require image resampling to a fixed resolution, which leads to artifacts and degradation of quality due to interpolation.

Method: RKM leverages scanner affine matrices to output keypoints in real-world coordinates through an extension of the KeyMorph framework, using a network to learn keypoints and a closed-form matching step to align images.

Result: RKM shows improved performance in aligning orthogonal 2D abdominal MRI scans and 3D brain volumes with varying resolutions, demonstrating its advantage over existing methods.

Conclusion: RKM effectively solves resolution mismatch issues in medical image registration without resampling, making it more robust and artifact-free compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 integrates a Chain-of-Thought framework to improve text-to-motion generation by focusing on linguistic reasoning and semantic guidance. It outperforms existing methods in generating consistent, diverse, and controllable motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for text-to-motion generation lack controllability, consistency, and diversity due to their reliance on end-to-end mapping strategies, which fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning.

Method: Motion-R1 incorporates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to decompose textual instructions into structured action paths and employs Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to jointly optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis with motion quality feedback.

Result: Motion-R1 demonstrates competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets, particularly in tasks requiring complex semantic understanding and long-term coherence.

Conclusion: Motion-R1 offers a significant improvement in text-to-motion generation by integrating linguistic reasoning and structured semantic paths, enhancing multi-step command interpretation and motion quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

### [120] [FSATFusion: Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10366)
*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui,Yuhan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FSATFusion, a novel image fusion method that leverages an improved Transformer architecture and frequency-spatial attention for superior infrared-visible image integration, showcasing strong performance in multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of convolutional neural networks in capturing global context during infrared and visible image fusion, which results in information loss and hampers fusion performance.

Method: The authors propose FSATFusion, an end-to-end fusion network featuring a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module and an improved Transformer module (ITM). These components aim to enhance feature extraction and global context understanding, improving image fusion quality.

Result: FSATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of fusion quality and efficiency, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments. The network also generalized well in additional tasks and achieved superior results in an object detection task.

Conclusion: FSATFusion offers a robust solution for image fusion tasks by addressing the limitations of existing methods, supported by its high performance in multiple benchmarks and tasks. The method enhances global context extraction and feature differentiation, making it highly effective for practical applications.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a unifying framework to interpret the self-attention mechanism in Transformers and proposes architectural modifications that improve both interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism, despite being fundamental to Transformer models, is difficult to interpret and lacks a theoretical foundation that explains its success and limitations.

Method: The authors propose a new image processing-inspired framework to analyze self-attention and its components, such as positional encoding and residual connections, and introduce two independent architectural modifications.

Result: Their proposed modifications are empirically shown to improve accuracy, robustness to data contamination and adversarial attacks, and performance on long-sequence tasks in language and vision domains.

Conclusion: The introduced framework bridges theoretical gaps in understanding self-attention, while the new modifications enhance both interpretability and model capability.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

### [122] [Leveraging 6DoF Pose Foundation Models For Mapping Marine Sediment Burial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10386)
*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The PoseIDON computer vision pipeline estimates the burial depth and orientation of objects on the seafloor using ROV video and CAD model alignment, achieving a mean burial depth error of ~10 cm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve burial depth estimation of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor for environmental and ecological risk assessment, which is hindered by occlusion, visibility issues, and object degradation.

Method: PoseIDON combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry, using ROV footage, CAD model alignment, and planar seafloor fitting to calculate object pose and burial depth.

Result: The method achieved a mean burial depth error of around 10 cm and identified spatial burial patterns consistent with sediment transport, validated using footage of 54 objects.

Conclusion: PoseIDON offers a scalable and non-invasive method for mapping seafloor burial, aiding environmental assessments and risk mitigation at contaminated marine sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART improves accuracy and reduces computational overhead in models like DeiT by partitioning images into adaptive, content-dependent patches of varying sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in Vision Transformer-like models that encode excessive background and miss critical local details due to reliance on fixed-size patches.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which uses learnable region scores and piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate tokens based on image content.

Result: DART boosts accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K) and achieves a 45% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining or improving performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic tokenization using DART enhances computer vision models' accuracy and efficiency, confirming its robustness across different architectures.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReconMOST, a diffusion model framework to reconstruct global ocean temperature fields with sparse observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like sparse data and high computational costs in traditional ocean reconstruction methods and limitations of ML approaches, especially under cloud occlusion.

Method: The paper pre-trains an unconditional diffusion model on historical simulation data to learn ocean temperature patterns. Sparse observational data guides the reverse diffusion process for accurate reconstructions.

Result: ReconMOST handles over 92.5% missing data while maintaining accuracy. MSE values are 0.049 for guidance, 0.680 for reconstruction, and 0.633 overall, proving its robustness.

Conclusion: ReconMOST successfully extends ML-based reconstruction to a global multi-layer scale, producing physically plausible results even in areas lacking observations.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pisces, a multimodal foundation model for simultaneous image understanding and generation using a decoupled visual encoding architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of unifying image understanding and generation into one model, overcoming the differences in visual features and training processes required for each task.

Method: Pisces employs a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture, tailored training techniques, and meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning.

Result: Pisces achieves strong performance in over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding and demonstrates robust generative capabilities on GenEval, an image generation benchmark.

Conclusion: Pisces advances unified multimodal models by leveraging decoupled visual encoders, illustrating the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LRRNet, a novel method for infrared small target detection leveraging low-rank background modeling for enhanced performance in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of infrared small target detection caused by low signal-to-clutter ratios, varying target morphologies, and weak visual cues with current techniques delivering unstable results.

Method: The proposed method, LRRNet, employs a compression-reconstruction-subtraction paradigm to model low-rank background structures in infrared images directly using deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner.

Result: LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods on public datasets in detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, achieving an average speed of 82.34 FPS with resilience to sensor noise.

Conclusion: The authors demonstrate the LRRNet's capability to stabilize performance in infrared small target detection with advancements in accuracy, speed, and robustness, claiming it as the first deep learning approach to learn low-rank background structures directly.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MF2Summ, a multimodal video summarization model integrating visual and auditory features through advanced attention mechanisms, yielding improved performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective video summarization techniques arises due to the rapid increase in online video content and the limitations of traditional unimodal approaches in capturing semantic richness.

Method: MF2Summ is a five-stage multimodal video summarization model that employs feature extraction (GoogLeNet for visual features, SoundNet for auditory features), cross-modal and self-attention Transformers for fusion, and algorithms like Non-Maximum Suppression and Kernel Temporal Segmentation for key shot selection.

Result: MF2Summ improves F1-scores on the SumMe and TVSum datasets by 1.9% and 0.6% respectively over the DSNet model and performs favorably against other state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: MF2Summ demonstrates the advantages of multimodal content understanding for video summarization, setting a new competitive benchmark in the field and showcasing the efficacy of cross-modal and alignment-guided attention processes.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces CIDer, a robust multimodal emotion recognition framework addressing both modality missing and out-of-distribution challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle with the simultaneous challenges of modality missing and OOD data, often relying on excessive parameters or specific models, thus limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: The framework, CIDer, uses Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) for enhanced robustness and Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) for tackling OOD challenges, complemented by efficient multimodal tools like WSAM and MCT.

Result: CIDer demonstrated strong performance in RMFM and OOD tasks while being computationally efficient with fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer provides a robust and efficient solution to MER challenges, making the study's methodology and datasets accessible for further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative video codec for human body videos using Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) to overcome explicit motion-based approach limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video compression techniques struggle with the complexity and diversity of human body motion, leading to motion inaccuracies and distortions in reconstruction.

Method: The authors propose using Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) to convert complex human body signals into compact visual representations for implicit motion-guided reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show that the IMT approach improves generative human video coding (GHVC), achieving better compression and synthesis fidelity compared to explicit motion-based methods.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of IMT in advancing compression and reconstruction quality in human body video coding, addressing the challenges of complex motion patterns.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Motivation: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for HSI classification are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing research in this domain is sparse, unlike for natural images. This paper aims to address the challenges of leveraging HSI's unique features to improve the transferability of adversarial examples.

Method: The proposed method employs block-wise transformations in both spatial and spectral dimensions to increase input diversity and reduce overfitting. It also introduces a feature distancing loss that disrupts the true class's feature representation, improving adversarial example transferability.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates strong transferability of adversarial examples to black-box models across two HSI datasets. It also shows resilience against defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: This research provides an effective technique to enhance adversarial attack transferability in HSI classification, leveraging unique image features and ensuring performance under defensive strategies.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

### [131] [Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463)
*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of weight initialization techniques on the quantization robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) and proposes a novel method called GHN-QAT for better quantized model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantizing DNNs for efficiency is crucial, but prior studies largely ignored the role of weight initialization in achieving quantization robustness, which prompted this investigation.

Method: The authors conducted extensive experiments on various CNN architectures to study the effects of weight initializations on quantization robustness. They introduced the use of Graph Hypernetworks (GHNs) to predict parameters for quantized DNNs.

Result: The study revealed that weight initialization significantly impacts quantization robustness. GHN-predicted parameters enhanced robustness, and finetuned GHNs (GHN-QAT) further improved accuracy for 4-bit and even 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: This pioneering work demonstrates that weight initialization is key to DNN quantization robustness, with GHN-QAT being a promising method for improving quantized model performance. The findings advocate further exploration into quantization-aware training using these initializations.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedSeg-R, a model combining multimodal reasoning and segmentation capabilities in the medical domain. It also presents MedSeg-QA, a large-scale, physician-refined dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models are insufficient due to their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack of active reasoning for complex medical queries.

Method: The proposed MedSeg-R framework consists of two key modules: (1) a global context understanding module for interpreting images and instructions, and (2) a pixel-level grounding module for generating segmentation masks and textual responses.

Result: MedSeg-R demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable textual analyses across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study combines advanced reasoning capabilities with segmentation accuracy, supported by a novel dataset (MedSeg-QA), advancing the field of automated medical image analysis.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

*Shahroz Tariq,David Nguyen,M. A. P. Chamikara,Tingmin Wu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude show promise in assisting deepfake detection but are not yet reliable for standalone use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes threaten media integrity and public trust, necessitating effective detection methods.

Method: Structured zero-shot evaluation of four VLMs on deepfake detection using a benchmark dataset.

Result: VLMs provide coherent explanations but fail in standalone reliability due to stylistic and pattern vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: VLMs can enhance human-led forensic workflows but require further refinement for autonomous applications.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Motivation: To address the lack of a standardized evaluation dataset and metric in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) research.

Method: The authors created the SMB dataset with diverse musical textures and developed the OMR-NED metric to provide detailed performance evaluation compared to the Symbol Error Rate (SER).

Result: The SMB dataset and OMR-NED metric enable clear comparisons of OMR methods and include baseline experiments using SMB's standardized splits to evaluate state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study fills a critical gap in OMR evaluation by offering a robust dataset and finely-grained metric, facilitating advancements in the domain.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops techniques for identifying the botanical origins of honey using class-incremental learning (CIL) and proposes a novel continual backpropagation (CB) method to enhance accuracy by 1-7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately determining the botanical origins of honey is vital to ensure diverse flavors, health benefits, and fair market value, but current models struggle with collecting all honey varieties at once.

Method: The researchers evaluated multiple CIL algorithms on a hyperspectral imaging dataset of honey and introduced the CB method to improve neuron efficiency by reinitializing unused neurons.

Result: CB method enhanced the performance of most class-incremental learning algorithms by 1-7% when applied to the dataset.

Conclusion: Including the CB algorithm in CIL approaches addresses neural network plasticity issues and improves the differentiation of honey's botanical origins effectively.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework to improve Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation by localizing and segmenting objects efficiently, reducing annotation needs, and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of dense annotations and complex scenes in the Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation task motivates the development of a more efficient and precise approach.

Method: The proposed method, PSLG-SAM, breaks the task into coarse localization using a visual grounding network and fine segmentation using a train-free SAM guided by clustering and boundary optimization.

Result: PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements and outperforms current state-of-the-art models on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M).

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the challenges of the RRSIS task by reducing annotation burdens, isolating specific segmentation regions, and delivering superior performance. The method and dataset promise impactful advancements in the field.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual aircraft damage inspection is inefficient and inconsistent, making automation crucial for scalability and reliability.

Method: J-DDL integrates laser scanners and cameras to build 2D and 3D data, with innovations in YOLO-based network architecture, feature extraction, EMA modules, and Inner-CIOU loss function for precise detection.

Result: The system demonstrated effective damage detection in experiments, and a public aircraft damage dataset was created for broader use.

Conclusion: J-DDL significantly improves fighter aircraft surface inspection, advancing automated and scalable maintenance technologies.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Conclusion: CogStream addresses the challenges of streaming video reasoning by improving model focus on relevant context and reducing computational loads, providing a path forward in video analysis.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all

structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured

*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric, Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), specifically for detecting subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems that traditional methods miss. CEI's focus is on analyzing score distribution tails and overall shapes, and it outperforms existing metrics in bias detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face recognition systems struggle to identify demographic bias, particularly in the tails of score distributions, highlighting the need for more sensitive and equitable metrics.

Method: The authors propose CEI, which separately evaluates genuine and impostor score distributions while targeting distribution tails and overall shapes. They also introduce CEI^A for automated bias detection to improve objectivity and practical use.

Result: Experiments show CEI's superior performance in identifying nuanced biases within state-of-the-art face recognition systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets compared to conventional metrics.

Conclusion: CEI and CEI^A offer a robust, sensitive approach for fairness assessment in face recognition systems. The methods extend to other applications where tail analysis of statistical distributions is required.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Method: The proposed framework combines paired human-product reference injection, a masked cross-attention mechanism, 3D body mesh templates, product bounding boxes, and structured text encoding to enhance motion realism and identity preservation.

Result: Experiments show that the framework maintains human and product identity integrity while generating realistic demonstration motions, outperforming existing techniques in accuracy and quality.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the viability of its Diffusion Transformer-based approach for improving human-product interaction videos, offering significant advancements over current methods in fidelity and natural interactions.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

### [146] [Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10573)
*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLACE, a novel framework for aligning medical images and reports at the pathological level without additional annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in learning medical visual representations due to the complexity and scarcity of data, as well as the need for better alignment between medical images and lengthy, intricate reports.

Method: PLACE (Pathological-Level Alignment with Correlation Exploration) is proposed, which includes the Pathological-Level Cross-Modal Alignment (PCMA) approach and a proxy task enforcing correlation recognition among image patches. It avoids reliance on external disease annotations and improves model generalizability.

Result: The introduced framework outperforms existing methods in multiple downstream tasks, such as classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection, and report generation.

Conclusion: PLACE effectively addresses the challenges in medical image-report alignment, increases generalizability, and sets new benchmarks in performance for various medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

### [147] [DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574)
*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DanceChat, a framework that enhances music-to-dance generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide textual choreographic instructions, ensuring diverse and musically aligned dance motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in music-to-dance generation where music offers abstract cues and provides limited information for diverse dance synthesis. Existing data scarcity and one-to-many mapping further complicate the problem.

Method: The framework combines three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generator for textual dance guidance, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction module integrating music, rhythm, and textual cues, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module with alignment loss for coordinated generation.

Result: Experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat improves diversity and alignment of dance motions, outperforming existing methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: DanceChat introduces LLM-guided mechanisms, effectively bridging the semantic gap between music and dance while enhancing creative and stylistic diversity in dance generation.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Chun-Mei Feng,Kai Yu,Xinxing Xu,Salman Khan,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Wangmeng Zuo,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2I-PAL, a method to reduce the modality gap between image and text features in pre-trained vision-language models (like CLIP), improving multi-label image recognition by leveraging text-to-image generation, heatmaps, learnable prototypes, and combined parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the modality gap in vision-language models like CLIP when using text as a representation for images (TaI), improving performance in image recognition tasks, particularly for multi-label image recognition, while maintaining parameter efficiency and avoiding full semantic image annotations.

Method: The method, T2I-PAL, uses text-to-image generation models to create photorealistic images from text captions to minimize the modality gap. It also incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes to enhance local feature robustness, and leverages combined prompt tuning and adapter learning for better parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: T2I-PAL achieves significant performance improvements, boosting recognition results by an average of 3.47% across benchmarks such as MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL demonstrates the effectiveness of tackling the modality gap issue through text-to-image generation and other enhancements, enabling superior performance in multi-label image recognition without requiring fully annotated training datasets and preserving compatibility with existing CLIP frameworks.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperSphereDiff, a novel diffusion model designed to preserve class geometry in hyperspherical data for improved generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models favor Euclidean spaces, which causes loss of class geometry in hyperspherical data, limiting generative performance.

Method: The authors propose HyperSphereDiff, a diffusion model aligning hyperspherical data structures with directional noise to capture angular uncertainty.

Result: Theoretically and empirically, HyperSphereDiff enhances generative models' accuracy by preserving hyperspherical manifold geometry.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff creates more geometry-aware generative models and is validated across multiple datasets, preserving angular subtleties effectively.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates enhancing self-distillation in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by refining random masking strategies within the DINO framework, which improves robustness and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns have been raised about random masking eliminating critical semantic information in self-distillation frameworks like DINO. The study aims to address these limitations by optimizing masking strategies.

Method: Random masking was applied selectively to the global views of the student model, while preserving clean, unmasked views for the student's local and teacher’s global views. Evaluation was conducted on mini-ImageNet with DINO-Tiny.

Result: The asymmetric random masking approach yielded more robust and fine-grained attention maps, leading to improved downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The proposed masking strategy effectively enhances self-distillation in ViTs by balancing clean supervision with induced robustness, showing promise for better vision task outcomes.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called HEA-MM to evaluate errors in aircraft CAD models using a hierarchical approach at global, part, and feature levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-quality aviation equipment necessitates precise error assessment of manufactured aircraft components compared to their CAD models.

Method: The HEA-MM framework employs structured light scanners for 3D measurements, error evaluation at three levels (global, part, feature), and novel algorithms for patch refinement and circular hole detection.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on various aircraft CAD models.

Conclusion: The hierarchical error assessment framework (HEA-MM) provides a comprehensive and effective solution for evaluating manufacturing errors in aircraft CAD models, potentially enhancing reliability and performance in aviation equipment.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSP, a novel framework that enhances oriented object detection under point supervision in remote sensing. It addresses annotation challenges and improves accuracy significantly compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the labor-intensive annotation process for high-density scenes in remote sensing while improving oriented object detection.

Method: SSP employs rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. It builds on two key innovations: spatial partitioning for sample assignment and bounding box extraction using semantic maps.

Result: The SSP framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enhances integration with existing architectures like ORCNN and ReDet, achieving superior mAP metrics.

Conclusion: SSP demonstrates a cost-effective and accurate approach for oriented object detection under point supervision, showcasing its potential in advancing remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI innovates image synthesis from WiFi signals using latent diffusion models for efficient, high-quality generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and enhance the quality of image generation from WiFi CSI measurements, addressing limitations in traditional GAN-based methods.

Method: It uses a lightweight neural network to map WiFi CSI amplitudes to the latent space of a pretrained latent diffusion model, followed by text-guided denoising diffusion and decoding for image creation.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms comparable methods in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, validated on new and existing datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the advantages of latent diffusion modeling for WiFi image synthesis and text-guided controllability, simplifying pipelines and achieving superior results.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MSTAR, a box-free solution to improve scene text retrieval using a progressive vision embedding approach and introducing a new MQTR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scene text retrieval require expensive bounding box annotations and often lack a unified mechanism to handle diverse query types.

Method: MSTAR employs progressive vision embedding for dynamic text representation and integrates a multi-instance matching module for better vision-language alignment. The authors also introduce the MQTR dataset for evaluation.

Result: MSTAR achieves a 6.4% MAP improvement on Total-Text and an 8.5% average increase over previous models on the new MQTR benchmark.

Conclusion: MSTAR offers an effective, annotation-free approach that surpasses previous state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability for diverse text queries.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor introduces a new method for generating consistent object textures from textual descriptions, outperforming prior methods in maintaining texture consistency across viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-texture synthesis face challenges in maintaining consistent textures across multiple viewpoints due to insufficient integration of synthesized textures and predefined camera positions that neglect object geometry.

Method: TexTailor applies a resampling scheme to integrate previously synthesized textures during the diffusion process and fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model with a performance preservation loss. It also adapts camera positions based on object geometry for improved consistency.

Result: Experiments on the Objaverse and ShapeNet car datasets show that TexTailor achieves superior view-consistent textures compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: TexTailor effectively addresses limitations in existing approaches and sets a new benchmark for view-consistent texture synthesis, with its source code publicly available.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

TL;DR: The paper explores text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging, specifically chest X-rays, highlighting alignment issues between radiology text and scans, and proposes a fine-tuning framework to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-guided image synthesis has thrived in RGB images but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to challenges like privacy-related data scarcity.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment between radiology text reports and relevant scan areas in pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models.

Result: The proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art results on the MS-CXR benchmark and robust performance on out-of-distribution data like VinDr-CXR.

Conclusion: Enhanced text-to-image alignment in diffusion models can be efficiently repurposed for downstream tasks, like phrase grounding in medical imaging, with promising benchmark performances.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a unified model that can handle semantic segmentation, classification, and generative tasks together, while providing bi-directional consistency and flexibility in conditioning.

Method: The paper introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a framework employing a symmetric learning objective to model forward and reverse transformations jointly, along with a new training objective to retain semantic information across flows for generative diversity.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic image synthesis with FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps, and delivers competitive results in segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: SymmFlow effectively unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and generative tasks within a single model, providing efficient sampling, semantic consistency, and broad applicability while outperforming existing methods in multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 enhances video generation by fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models without human supervision and with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address shortcomings in video generation quality such as instance preservation and motion rationality, while eliminating reliance on human annotations and large-scale computational resources.

Method: The method includes a prompt-driven data engine for diverse training samples and a reward-guided training strategy that uses feedback from pre-trained vision-language models.

Result: In evaluations, GigaVideo-1 improved performance across 17 dimensions by about 4% on average with only 4 GPU-hours.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 is an efficient and effective fine-tuning framework that enhances video generation quality with minimal human input and computational effort.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a vision transformer-based model that offers interpretable image classification by learning human-understandable prototypes, particularly in the context of retinal OCT imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods often struggle with producing interpretable visualizations of learned prototypes, and existing methods are unsuitable for medical imaging where lesion and biomarker interpretation is key.

Method: The proposed PiPViT uses a vision transformer to learn interpretable prototypes by understanding patch-based context and leveraging techniques like contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing to locate biomarkers effectively.

Result: PiPViT demonstrated competitive performance on retinal OCT datasets, delivering semantically and clinically relevant prototypes along with meaningful diagnostic explanations.

Conclusion: PiPViT succeeds in combining interpretability and accuracy, showing its potential to assist clinicians by providing transparent diagnostic insights.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Subhram Dasgupta,Janelle Mason,Xiaohong Yuan,Olusola Odeyomi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles deepfake detection by developing a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) integrated with Squeeze and Excitation block attention to enhance efficiency. The model achieved high accuracy on the Style GAN dataset with reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes are a growing threat to information authenticity and security, necessitating effective detection methods to combat manipulated digital content.

Method: A lightweight CNN incorporating Squeeze and Excitation block attention, designed to recalibrate channel-wise features dynamically, enabling more efficient and effective detection.

Result: The model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.14% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse Fake Face Dataset.

Conclusion: This research presents a scalable and efficient deepfake detection solution, leveraging minimal computational resources while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), improving traditional CAPTCHA security against deep learning attacks through a novel framework that utilizes text prompts and adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHA systems are increasingly being overcome by advancements in deep neural networks, requiring improved defensive measures to preserve security.

Method: The paper presents UAC leveraging text-based prompts, Large Language Models (LLMs), and optimization techniques in targeted and untargeted scenarios through diffusion models and multimodal gradients.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high success rates in attacks, creating CAPTCHAs that are indistinguishable to humans and deep neural networks across multiple systems.

Conclusion: UAC provides a promising approach to generating more secure CAPTCHA systems while maintaining usability against increasingly sophisticated automated attacks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a robust multi-task architecture for classifying minors' ages in images, addressing class imbalance through specific techniques and achieving strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance automatic age screening in images against distribution shifts and data under-representation of minors.

Method: Utilizes a multi-task model based on a frozen FaRL backbone combined with an MLP; employs focal-style loss, age-balanced sampling, and an age gap technique for training.

Result: Improved age detection accuracy, reducing RMSE and boosting metrics like F2 score in restricted and wild-domain tests.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates resilience and improved generalization under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperCLIC, an algorithm for continual learning of instances and classes simultaneously, using hyperbolic space for hierarchical relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning has focused on either instance or class recognition, but real-world scenarios often require handling both at once, creating the need for a model that can adapt to varying levels of granularity over time.

Method: The authors designed HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm that leverages the properties of hyperbolic space for hierarchical data. It includes hyperbolic classification and distillation techniques. They also propose new continual hierarchical metrics for evaluation.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that HyperCLIC performs effectively across hierarchical tasks and provides improved generalization at multiple levels of data granularity.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC successfully adapts to the hierarchical nature of instance and class learning while improving performance in real-world-like continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model, a novel post-processing refinement framework for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), achieving performance improvements with minimal computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), current methods lack sufficient post-processing refinement to address subtle differences between objects and their backgrounds.

Method: The authors propose the UMBD model, which selectively refines poorly segmented regions using an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism and integrates it with a novel Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network (HUQNet) for adaptive guidance.

Result: The UMBD framework demonstrates consistent improvements across COD benchmarks, achieving average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: UMBD proves to be an effective generative refinement framework that can enhance existing COD models, bridging the gap between discriminative capabilities and generative advantages in this domain.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

*Emílio Dolgener Cantú,Rolf Klemens Wittmann,Oliver Abdeen,Patrick Wagner,Wojciech Samek,Moritz Baier,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning methodology to create synthetic golden standards for defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing, overcoming the limitations of manual inspection and absent golden standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of golden standards due to low production scales and high design variability in InP wafer manufacturing necessitates manual defect detection, which is labor-intensive and inefficient.

Method: Deep Neural Networks are trained to generate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data. A comparison is made between various training objectives and the quality of simulated images on synthetic and real data.

Result: The deep-learning method significantly outperforms a baseline decision-tree approach, enabling effective surface defect detection using simulated golden dies.

Conclusion: Simulated golden standards derived from CAD data can enhance defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing, reducing reliance on manual methods and improving efficiency.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IQE-CLIP, a system improving zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) in the medical domain, achieving better results by integrating instance-aware visual and textual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods require category knowledge and specifically designed prompts, which limit their effectiveness in distinguishing normal versus anomalous cases. There is also limited research for medical applications.

Method: IQE-CLIP utilizes both class-based prompts and a novel instance-aware query module to extract contextual region-level information from vision and language modalities, creating more effective embeddings for detecting anomalies.

Result: The proposed framework shows state-of-the-art performance across six medical datasets in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection settings.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP offers a more robust solution to anomaly detection in medical contexts by optimizing CLIP with innovative components, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PosterCraft, a unified framework for generating aesthetically appealing posters with a cascaded workflow strategy, significantly outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing visually appealing posters requires not just text rendering but also integrating artistic content and layout harmony, which existing modular methods fail to achieve.

Method: The authors propose PosterCraft, which relies on a cascaded workflow of text-rendering optimization, region-aware fine-tuning, aesthetic reinforcement learning, and feedback refinement.

Result: PosterCraft demonstrates superior rendering accuracy, layout cohesion, and visual appeal compared to open-source alternatives, nearing the quality of state-of-the-art commercial systems.

Conclusion: PosterCraft provides a robust and automated solution for high-quality poster generation, eliminating the need for predefined modular pipelines and rigid layouts, thus advancing both visual design and machine learning workflows.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA) model for ultra-large arbitrary-scale image super-resolution, which effectively overcomes limitations like blurring and distribution drift in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing arbitrary-scale image super-resolution methods struggle to maintain performance for large upsampling factors, leading to distortion and blurring.

Method: The proposed SbCA framework utilizes a stroke vector amplifier to decompose the image into strokes for vector magnification and a detail completion module for reconstructing missing details. A cyclic strategy iteratively refines details across scales.

Result: The SbCA model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ultra-large super-resolution tasks, achieving high-quality image reconstruction even at extreme scales like ×100.

Conclusion: SbCA successfully enhances image super-resolution for ultra-large upsampling factors with superior quality, providing a unified, efficient, and scalable solution.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotPi, a model that integrates physical knowledge into object-centric reasoning and demonstrates adaptability across fluid and object interaction scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address gaps in current object-centric dynamic simulation methods, particularly the lack of physical knowledge integration and limited validation in diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: SlotPi combines a Hamiltonian physics-based module with a spatio-temporal prediction component for robust dynamic forecasting. It emphasizes object interactions, fluid flow, and their combination.

Result: The model demonstrated superior prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance across benchmark and fluid datasets, validated by a newly created real-world dataset.

Conclusion: SlotPi showcases adaptability and accuracy in diverse scenarios, setting the groundwork for developing sophisticated world modeling approaches.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic navigation systems face challenges with conventional image-based controllers, including motion blur, latency, and fixed processing rates.

Method: The framework utilizes event cameras for asynchronous vision processing, range sensing, and a learning approach combining imitation learning and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient optimization.

Result: The proposed method shows promising results in simulations, achieving robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Event cameras combined with reinforcement learning can enhance robotic navigation by enabling adaptive, real-time control in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Prompts-to-Summaries, a zero-shot user-controllable video summarization pipeline utilizing language models to summarize video content without training data. It outperforms unsupervised methods and competes with supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in video data demands effective summarization tools that generalize across domains, incorporate user input, and avoid reliance on training datasets.

Method: The pipeline segments videos into scenes, generates rich descriptions using video-language models, scores scene importance using large language models, and refines results over short segments with metrics for consistency and uniqueness.

Result: On benchmarks like SumMe, TVSum, and QFVS, the method surpasses unsupervised approaches and competes with supervised ones despite not relying on training data. A new dataset, VidSum-Reason, is introduced.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models with thoughtful prompting and scoring offer a robust foundation for universal text-queryable video summarization, enabling advances without requiring training datasets.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmoothProper, a neural module that helps unsupervised deformable image registration methods address challenges involving sparse features and large smooth regions, with results showing improved registration precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised deformable image registration algorithms struggle with challenges such as sparse features and large displacements, particularly in datasets like retinal vessels. These limitations arise due to the unconstrained deformation fields post-training and reliance on network weights for regularization.

Method: The paper proposes SmoothProper, a neural plug-and-play module that integrates a duality-based optimization layer and uses specific interaction terms to enforce smoothness, promote message passing during the network's forward pass, and maintain structural consistency.

Result: SmoothProper significantly reduces registration error, achieving an accuracy of 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 retinal vessel images. It effectively addresses both aperture and large displacement challenges and seamlessly integrates with existing frameworks while minimizing parameter overhead.

Conclusion: SmoothProper demonstrates the potential to overcome key limitations of unsupervised DIR methods, setting a milestone as the first method to address both aperture and large displacement challenges within this domain. Its model-agnostic design and efficient results show promise for broader applications.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.

*Hui Yang,Wei Sun,Jian Liu,Jin Zheng,Jian Xiao,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HOMAE, a novel hand-object pose estimation method that uses masked autoencoders and integrates implicit and explicit geometric representations to tackle occlusion issues effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing hand-object pose estimation methods, specifically their inefficiency in handling occluded hand-object interactions due to insufficient global structural perception and reasoning.

Method: The key methods include a target-focused masking strategy for occlusion handling, prediction of a signed distance field (SDF) using multi-scale features, and combining implicit SDF with explicit point cloud representations for enhanced geometric perception.

Result: The proposed HOMAE method achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object pose estimation on challenging benchmarks such as DexYCB and HO3Dv2.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that HOMAE's occlusion-aware approach, leveraging contextual learning and the fusion of implicit and explicit geometric representations, significantly improves hand-object pose estimation. Code and model will be publicly released.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

*Huaying Yuan,Zheng Liu,Junjie Zhou,Ji-Rong Wen,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents VideoDeepResearch, a framework combining a reasoning model with modular multi-modal tools for better long video understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in long video understanding without relying on MLLMs with extended context windows and domain-specific capabilities.

Method: The framework combines a text-based large reasoning model with tool modules for multimodal retrieval and visual perception, using a strategy of selective access to video content.

Result: VideoDeepResearch surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks significantly, with improvements of 9.6% on MLVU, 6.6% on LVBench, and 3.9% on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: Agentic systems like VideoDeepResearch present a promising direction to solve the complexities in long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting, addressing challenges of accuracy and temporal coherence in resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of deploying computationally intensive video matting models on resource-constrained devices by maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence during quantization.

Method: The method involves a two-stage PTQ framework: block-reconstruction-based optimization and global affine calibration, complemented by an Optical Flow Assistance component for leveraging temporal and semantic priors.

Result: PTQ4VM achieves state-of-the-art performance across different bit-widths, reduces errors by up to 20%, and delivers near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ4VM framework effectively bridges the gap in video matting quantization, enabling efficient deployment with significant FLOP savings and high accuracy.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

TL;DR: VRBench is a new benchmark for evaluating large models' ability to perform multi-step reasoning in long narrative videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to account for multi-step temporal reasoning and procedural validity in long narrative videos.

Method: VRBench uses human-labeled reasoning chains and a multi-phase evaluation pipeline to assess models' reasoning capabilities.

Result: Evaluated 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs using VRBench, with insights on their performance in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VRBench advances the study of multi-step reasoning in large models, providing comprehensive metrics and valuable analysis tools.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CreatiPoster, an AI framework for generating editable and aesthetically pleasing graphic designs from natural language instructions or user assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating professional-level graphic designs is challenging and time-consuming, especially for beginners, and existing AI tools fail to meet all user needs, such as editability and visual quality.

Method: The CreatiPoster framework employs an RGBA multimodal model to generate JSON specifications for graphic layers and a conditional background model for synthesizing coherent backgrounds.

Result: CreatiPoster outperforms leading open-source and proprietary design tools based on benchmark evaluations and offers diverse applications such as multilingual adaptation and responsive resizing.

Conclusion: CreatiPoster democratizes graphic design with its innovative methods, surpassing existing tools, and provides a freely available design dataset for further research.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [178] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses improving zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) by analyzing and mitigating text-image offset misalignment in the CLIP embedding space, introducing a new method called Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSGM methods suffer from quality degradation due to an overly simplistic assumption of complete alignment between text and image offsets in the CLIP embedding space.

Method: The authors performed an empirical study on text-image offset misalignment in CLIP embedding for public datasets and introduced AIR, a refinement-based method to improve image quality by accounting for offset misalignment.

Result: Empirical findings show that offset misalignment correlates with concept distance, and the proposed AIR method offers state-of-the-art performance in 26 setups, confirmed by qualitative, quantitative, and user studies.

Conclusion: By addressing the limitations of current ZSGM methods with AIR, the paper demonstrates improved target domain image quality effectively leveraging insights into offset misalignment.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework, to efficiently generate high-quality text-to-video outputs by addressing computational and design challenges in spatiotemporal modeling and sequence processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to overcome computational inefficiencies and visual quality degradation in text-to-video generation tasks, especially in high-resolution and long-context scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces the MM-DiM block within M4V for efficient multi-modal integration and spatiotemporal modeling, reducing computational complexity. Additionally, it employs a reward learning strategy to improve visual realism during autoregressive generation.

Result: M4V reduces FLOPs by 45% compared to attention-based approaches for high-resolution video generation and achieves high visual quality in text-to-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: M4V demonstrates the capability to generate high-quality videos at lower computational costs, making it a practical solution for spatiotemporal video modeling in text-to-video tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to learning in-context image editing capabilities directly from videos, bypassing traditional task-specific models and pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context image editing methods rely heavily on expert models and curated training datasets, which can be labor-intensive and less scalable.

Method: The authors propose a block-causal diffusion transformer model trained on video data annotated as interleaved multimodal sequences using three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks and showcases abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and editing chains.

Conclusion: Learning in-context image editing capabilities directly from videos is feasible and scalable, paving the way for broader applications and reduced reliance on curated datasets.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "SpectralAR," a framework for autoregressive visual generation based on spectral tokenization, achieving causality and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive visual generation methods struggle with spatial patch-based sequences that conflict with causal modeling. The authors aim to address this issue for improved scalability and compatibility.

Method: The authors propose Nested Spectral Tokenization to order image components by frequencies and perform autoregressive generation coarse-to-fine based on spectral tokens.

Result: SpectralAR achieves superior performance with 3.02 gFID on ImageNet-1K, using only 64 tokens and 310 million parameters.

Conclusion: SpectralAR offers an efficient and causal autoregressive framework, improving upon limitations of spatial patch approaches while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

TL;DR: The paper introduces the task of knowledge image generation and proposes a benchmark called MMMG for evaluating image generation models' reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the challenge of generating clear explanatory visuals that integrate world knowledge and pixel-level grounding, reflecting human learning advantages like the picture-superiority effect.

Method: The researchers developed the MMMG benchmark with 4,456 image-prompt pairs across various disciplines and use a Knowledge Graph representation to assess reasoning models. They also propose the MMMG-Score to evaluate factual fidelity and visual clarity.

Result: The evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art models showed poor reasoning capabilities, with GPT-4o achieving a top MMMG-Score of 50.20 and highlighting model shortcomings in entity fidelity and relation clarity.

Conclusion: The MMMG benchmark is effective in exposing reasoning deficits in current models while spurring further study; they also introduced FLUX-Reason as an open baseline for future exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner proposes a novel visual token pruning method to reduce inference cost in multimodal large language models while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies caused by redundant visual tokens in multimodal large language models, which lead to high inference costs.

Method: The CDPruner method maximizes conditional diversity of retained visual tokens using determinantal point process (DPP), and conditions token selection on user instructions.

Result: CDPruner achieves significant computational reductions (95% FLOPs, 78% CUDA latency) and maintains 94% of original accuracy in MLLMs such as LLaVA.

Conclusion: The proposed CDPruner enhances efficiency and maintains performance in vision-language tasks, setting new benchmarks for visual token pruning methods.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Motivation: The credibility of real-world information is threatened by advanced video generation technologies, necessitating reliable detectors to identify AI-generated content.

Method: The paper presents GenWorld, a diverse and high-quality dataset with real-world simulated videos generated using state-of-the-art models, and SpannDetector, a detection method using multi-view consistency.

Result: Experiments show SpannDetector achieves superior detection performance on challenging AI-generated videos produced by advanced models.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector offer significant advancements in AI-generated video detection, with promising implications for robustness and explainability in this field.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "QuadricFormer," a model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction using superquadrics, which enables concise representation of complex structures in driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D occupancy prediction methods for autonomous driving struggle with inefficiency due to dense voxel-based or object-centric representations that inadequately model diverse structures in driving environments.

Method: The paper proposes a probabilistic superquadric mixture model that uses superquadrics with varied geometries as scene primitives to model occupancy probabilities efficiently. It integrates a pruning-and-splitting module to focus on occupied regions.

Result: Their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, surpassing existing methods while being more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: By leveraging geometrically expressive superquadrics and efficient representation strategies, "QuadricFormer" provides a robust solution for 3D occupancy prediction, enhancing perception capabilities in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods in diffusion models lack principled strategies for identifying where perturbations should optimally occur, especially in architectures like Diffusion Transformers where computations affecting quality are spread across layers.

Method: The authors analyze attention granularity at the head level within Diffusion Transformers, discovering specialization of heads for distinct visual concepts. They then propose "HeadHunter" for systematic head selection and "SoftPAG," a method for fine-tuning perturbation strength via linear interpolation of attention maps.

Result: The framework was tested on large-scale text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1. It was found to outperform layer-level perturbation methods, providing enhanced general quality, reduced oversmoothing issues, and precise style-specific control.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel head-level approach to attention perturbation, uncovering interpretable specializations in attention heads and enabling more effective and customizable guidance for diffusion-based model generation.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes InstaInpaint, a method for fast and effective 3D scene inpainting with significant speed improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting methods are too slow and computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for real-time applications in virtual and augmented reality.

Method: InstaInpaint is a reference-based feed-forward framework that uses a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy for training and produces 3D inpainting based on 2D proposals in 0.4 seconds.

Result: InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed increase compared to prior methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, ensuring textural consistency and geometric correctness.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint offers a practical, efficient solution for real-time 3D inpainting, supporting flexible downstream applications like object insertion and multi-region repairs in virtual and augmented reality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [188] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SceneCompleter, a framework for 3D-consistent novel view synthesis using dense scene completion and a dual-stream diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models in novel view synthesis struggle with reconstructing accurate 3D structures due to their reliance on 2D completion, leading to smooth surfaces and distorted geometry.

Method: SceneCompleter employs a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model to synthesize RGBD novel views and uses a scene embedder for better scene understanding from reference images.

Result: The method excels in generating visually coherent and 3D-consistent results across diverse datasets by integrating structural and textural features.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter sets a new standard in 3D-consistent novel view synthesis, addressing existing generative limitations effectively through innovative modeling and scene understanding techniques.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse matrix-vector multiplication performance is critical for many computational tasks, and understanding how sparse matrix reordering can optimize this process is essential for enhancing efficiency on multicore CPUs.

Method: The authors analyze various sparse matrix reordering strategies, evaluate their impacts on both sequential and parallel execution using different CPUs, and measure performance gains while addressing load imbalance and consistency issues.

Result: Reordering strategies demonstrate varying levels of performance improvement across CPUs, significantly optimizing data movement and load-balancing.

Conclusion: Sparse matrix reordering is a valuable technique to enhance the efficiency of matrix-vector multiplication, but the performance gains depend on the combination of CPU platforms and specific reordering methods.

Abstract: This work evaluates the impact of sparse matrix reordering on the performance
of sparse matrix-vector multiplication across different multicore CPU
platforms. Reordering can significantly enhance performance by optimizing the
non-zero element patterns to reduce total data movement and improve the
load-balancing. We examine how these gains vary over different CPUs for
different reordering strategies, focusing on both sequential and parallel
execution. We address multiple aspects, including appropriate measurement
methodology, comparison across different kinds of reordering strategies,
consistency across machines, and impact of load imbalance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address failures in complex systems by creating an optimized approach for software component distribution and replication across diverse hardware.

Method: Uses a state-space exploration technique with optimizations like quotient reductions and equivalence relations to devise resilient configurations and reconfiguration policies.

Result: Demonstrated the framework's efficacy with experimental results on an autonomous driving system model.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves system resilience, adaptability, and can handle varied hardware and failure scenarios effectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a powerful automated framework for making complex systems
resilient under failures, by optimized adaptive distribution and replication of
interdependent software components across heterogeneous hardware components
with widely varying capabilities. A configuration specifies how software is
distributed and replicated: which software components to run on each computer,
which software components to replicate, which replication protocols to use,
etc. We present an algorithm that, given a system model and resilience
requirements, (1) determines initial configurations of the system that are
resilient, and (2) generates a reconfiguration policy that determines
reconfiguration actions to execute in response to failures and recoveries. This
model-finding algorithm is based on state-space exploration and incorporates
powerful optimizations, including a quotient reduction based on a novel
equivalence relation between states. We present experimental results from
successfully applying a prototype implementation of our framework to a model of

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in CUDA transpilation to other platforms, proposing a framework leveraging AI, automatic optimization, and a graph-based approach to improve the performance of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA's dominance in parallel computing necessitates efficient translation of its software to other hardware platforms for compatibility and performance portability.

Method: The authors developed a novel framework integrating AI compilers, automatic optimization technology, and graph-based data augmentation. They also introduced HPCTransEval for evaluating CUDA transpilation quality.

Result: Experiments on CUDA-to-CPU transpilation reveal significant improvements in performance and efficacy in LLM-based scenarios using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the ability of LLMs to address CUDA compatibility challenges effectively, advancing solutions within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for sustainable AI practices calls for optimizing Federated Learning by balancing energy efficiency and model performance, addressing device and data heterogeneity.

Method: The authors introduce a bi-level Integer Linear Programming formulation that integrates Shapley values and predictive models for energy and time to optimize client selection in FL.

Result: FedJoule improves training accuracy by 15% and reduces training time by 48% compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods, demonstrating superior performance across varying energy budgets and data distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively demonstrates the feasibility of balancing energy usage with model performance, offering a sustainable AI solution within Federated Learning frameworks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, optimizing both
energy efficiency and model accuracy remains a challenge, given device and data
heterogeneity. Further, sustainable AI through a global energy budget for FL
has not been explored. We propose a novel optimization problem for client
selection in FL that maximizes the model accuracy within an overall energy
limit and reduces training time. We solve this with a unique bi-level ILP
formulation that leverages approximate Shapley values and energy-time
prediction models to efficiently solve this. Our FedJoule framework achieves
superior training accuracies compared to SOTA and simple baselines for diverse
energy budgets, non-IID distributions, and realistic experiment configurations,
performing 15% and 48% better on accuracy and time, respectively. The results
highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving a viable trade-off
between energy usage and performance in FL environments.

*Joanna Georgiou,Moysis Symeonides,George Pallis,Marios D. Dikaiakos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an auto-benchmarking framework aimed at analyzing multi-tenancy performance in Edge Computing environments, addressing resource contention, security, and deployment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify the need for efficient tools to address security and performance concerns stemming from multi-tenancy in Edge Computing environments.

Method: The proposed framework automates analysis using a built-in monitoring stack and supports benchmarking across various workloads, including streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning applications, and stress testing.

Result: The case-driven analysis provides insights into the effects of multi-tenancy across different hardware configurations and workloads.

Conclusion: The publicly available framework streamlines multi-tenancy analysis in Edge Computing, enabling better management and optimization of such environments.

Abstract: Edge Computing emerges as a promising alternative of Cloud Computing, with
scalable compute resources and services deployed in the path between IoT
devices and Cloud. Since virtualization techniques can be applied on Edge
compute nodes, administrators can share their Edge infrastructures among
multiple users, providing the so-called multi-tenancy. Even though
multi-tenancy is unavoidable, it raises concerns about security and performance
degradation due to resource contention in Edge Computing. For that,
administrators need to deploy services with non-antagonizing profiles and
explore workload co-location scenarios to enhance performance and energy
consumption. Achieving this, however, requires extensive configuration,
deployment, iterative testing, and analysis, an effort-intensive and
time-consuming process. To address this challenge, we introduce an
auto-benchmarking framework designed to streamline the analysis of
multi-tenancy performance in Edge environments. Our framework includes a
built-in monitoring stack and integrates with widely used benchmarking
workloads, such as streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning
applications, and component-based stress testing. We perform a case-driven
analysis and provide valuable insights into the impact of multi-tenancy on Edge
environments with different hardware configurations and diverse workloads.
Finally, the implementation of our framework, along with the containerized
workloads used for experimentation, is publicly available.

*Hongbin Zhang,Taosheng Wei,Zhenyi Zheng,Jiangsu Du,Zhiguang Chen,Yutong Lu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TD-Pipe improves LLM inference throughput by addressing pipeline imbalances and reducing bubbles with its novel temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism architecture and optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies in pipeline parallelism during large language model (LLM) inference caused by imbalanced workloads and phase switching, which lead to significant performance reduction.

Method: TD-Pipe disaggregates the prefill and decode phases temporally to eliminate pipeline bubbles. It introduces a hierarchy-controller for device coordination, an AI-based greedy prefill strategy, inter-batch work stealing for workload balancing, and a spatial-temporal intensity comparison approach to optimize phase switching.

Result: TD-Pipe achieves up to 1.91x throughput improvement over tensor parallelism and 2.73x improvement over existing pipeline parallel methods on GPU setups with PCIe interconnections.

Conclusion: TD-Pipe demonstrates significant efficiency gains in LLM inference by addressing phase switching bottlenecks and optimizing workload distribution in pipeline parallelism.

Abstract: As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great
promise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on
communications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data
dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline
bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the
pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,
with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism
architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and
decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles
caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of
exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a
hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline
parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based
greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the
output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work
stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different
batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison
approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the
performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase
switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively
increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing
tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach
on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital twin systems face challenges in balancing real-time responsiveness and computational efficiency, struggling to fully utilize cloud or edge capabilities for complex tasks.

Method: HP2C-DT integrates High-Performance Computing into the digital twin continuum, using the COMPSs framework to dynamically allocate workloads across edge, cloud, and HPC resources.

Result: Testing in a power grid use case demonstrated reduced communication bandwidth (by an order of magnitude), improved response times (up to 2x), and strong computational scaling across diverse infrastructures.

Conclusion: HP2C-DT architecture offers a smarter, faster approach for digital twins, addressing latency, resource, and real-world complexity challenges to enhance system efficiency.

Abstract: Digital twins are transforming the way we monitor, analyze, and control
physical systems, but designing architectures that balance real-time
responsiveness with heavy computational demands remains a challenge.
Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints,
while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations
and data-driven optimizations.
  To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance
Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which
integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum.
Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT
makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks
to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs.
  Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the
HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless
workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power
grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of
magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to
2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for
compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These
results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond
their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of
handling real-world complexity.

TL;DR: The paper addresses communication inefficiencies in decentralized learning and proposes a graph-based gossiping mechanism using minimum spanning tree and graph coloring to optimize network communication and structure. Experiments show up to 8X bandwidth and 4.4X time reduction compared to naive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on a single central server in federated learning introduces risks such as single-point failure and bottlenecks, necessitating decentralized approaches that avoid these risks but face communication inefficiency challenges.

Method: A graph-based gossip mechanism is proposed utilizing minimum spanning tree and graph coloring. Subnetworks are configured and managed on real routers/devices to better simulate real-world decentralized learning setups.

Result: The proposed approach improves communication efficiency across various topologies and data sizes by reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to 8 and 4.4 times respectively compared to naive flooding methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses communication inefficiencies in decentralized learning setups and is applicable to real-world distributed environments, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for
collaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its
reliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks
of single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as
decentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role
across nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure
decentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise
from increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing
proposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and
decentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable
performance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the
lack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model
size and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized
learning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where
specifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize
network structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various
network topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages
subnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world
distributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and
data sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4
times, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

TL;DR: The paper extends the traditional red-blue pebble game by introducing partial computations to reduce I/O costs in computation models, while maintaining NP-hardness for optimal cost assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original red-blue pebble game assumes simultaneous input storage for computations, which is unrealistic for scenarios allowing incremental aggregation. The paper seeks a cost model reflecting such realistic operations.

Method: The study introduces Partial Computing Red-Blue Pebble Game (PRBP), examines specific cases and fundamental properties, adapts tools like $S$-partitions, and employs proofs for theoretical bounds and hardness results.

Result: Partial computations can reduce I/O costs significantly, up to a linear factor in certain cases. However, determining optimal strategies remains NP-hard, even for approximations.

Conclusion: Although partial computation steps improve the cost model realism and efficiency, optimizing cost within the PRBP framework persists as a computationally hard problem.

Abstract: We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with
partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the
original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in
fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be
aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation
steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in
settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended
red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.
  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue
pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some
simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal
I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor
this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations
allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,
a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP
model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost
of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result
from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP
to any reasonable factor.

*Waylon Luo,Jiapeng Zhao,Tong Zhan,Qiang Guan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simulation tool for distributed scheduling of quantum workloads on networked quantum processors while analyzing four scheduling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Present-day quantum computing suffers from hardware limitations like limited qubits, short coherence times, and high error susceptibility, complicating the execution of complex algorithms. The paper seeks to address the inefficiencies in scheduling and resource allocation in such constrained, error-prone environments.

Method: The researchers developed a simulation-based tool for quantum circuit decomposition and distributed execution using networked QPUs connected by classical channels. They analyzed four scheduling techniques, including one using reinforcement learning, under metrics like runtime, fidelity, and communication cost.

Result: The study compares the strengths and weaknesses of the four scheduling approaches. It highlights how parallel, noise-aware scheduling improves computational efficiency and fidelity in distributed quantum systems.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that effective scheduling strategies significantly enhance throughput and accuracy in quantum computations, enabling better utilization of distributed QPU networks.

Abstract: Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited
qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all
of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement
of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum
hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally,
inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine
system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads
under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource
coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing,
retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to
distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to
efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum
processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we
introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and
concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time
classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that
surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through
inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare
four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by
reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics,
including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs.
Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and
highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve
computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.

### [203] [Leveraging Pre-Trained Models for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning under Adaptive Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09999)
*Yukun Chen,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng,Hongliang Li,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) method leveraging vision, audio, and text modalities, proposing innovative strategies to address incremental learning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional MCIL methods that focus solely on vision and text, ensuring better multimodal integration and addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The approach includes a Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE), Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM), multimodal class-incremental contrastive training loss, and two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics.

Result: Experiments on three multimodal datasets demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in integrating modalities and incremental class learning.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIL method succeeds in advancing multimodal learning by mitigating forgetting and enhancing cross-modal alignment and feature fusion.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOCL, a framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models to enhance performance in zero-shot graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Graph Neural Networks in zero-shot learning scenarios and challenges of applying Large Language Models to graph-related tasks.

Method: NOCL employs node description for heterogeneous attributes and node concept for semantic embeddings, reducing token length while integrating graph tasks into unified language-based queries.

Result: NOCL achieves competitive supervised performance and excels in zero-shot generalization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: NOCL offers a promising new direction for Graph Foundation Models by overcoming key limitations and enhancing generalization capabilities in graph-related tasks.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of deep learning, with a focus on tandem neural networks (TNN), for inverse design and optical property prediction of SiO2/TiO2 thin films.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in traditional inverse design methods, which rely on extensive simulations and optimizations, by leveraging deep learning approaches.

Method: The method involves implementing TNNs using combinations of multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms to optimize the inverse design process.

Result: The study finds that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN achieves the highest accuracy, while a CNN-LSTM-based TNN offers a balanced trade-off between accuracy and training speed.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based TNNs show significant promise in improving efficiency and performance for optical property prediction and inverse design in multilayer thin films, with CNN-LSTM being the practical optimal choice.

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

*Shangpin Peng,Weinong Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Senqiao Yang,Xing Wu,Haotian Xu,Chengquan Zhang,Takashi Isobe,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO introduces a new framework to optimize reinforcement learning preferences by focusing on the inherent quality and evolving model performance, resulting in better performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO approaches fail to differentiate between preference pairs based on their quality and utility, leading to inefficient data usage and suboptimal learning outcomes.

Method: Omni-DPO employs a dual-perspective optimization framework that dynamically weights training samples based on their quality and the model's performance on them.

Result: Omni-DPO improves data utilization and achieves superior performance on benchmarks, surpassing competitors in textual understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO effectively addresses deficiencies in current DPO methods, offering a robust and generalizable solution for reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2 improves analog topology generation with better precision sensitivity, reduced token length complexities, and enhanced transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating analog topology design is crucial due to the heavy manual effort and tailored needs required by modern applications.

Method: The paper introduces SFCI, a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier, implemented within LaMAGIC2 to optimize circuit representation.

Result: Experiments show LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates (tight tolerance: 0.01) and 10x lower MSEs compared to previous methods, with better transferability for larger circuits.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 establishes itself as a robust and efficient framework for analog topology generation addressing prior deficiencies in precision sensitivity and scalability.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

*Brendan Leigh Ross,Noël Vouitsis,Atiyeh Ashari Ghomi,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Ji Xin,Zhaoyan Liu,Yi Sui,Shiyi Hou,Kin Kwan Leung,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a Bayesian framework to improve uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs), proposing a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MHLP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with accurate uncertainty quantification, posing challenges in high-stakes applications, particularly due to the black-box nature and sensitivity to prompts.

Method: The authors treat prompts as statistical parameters and introduce MHLP, an MCMC algorithm tailored to LLMs, enabling Bayesian inference and principled uncertainty quantification.

Result: The approach improves predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification across various benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating Bayesian methods enhances LLM reliability and opens pathways for robust systems in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

### [209] [Optimizing Latent Dimension Allocation in Hierarchical VAEs: Balancing Attenuation and Information Retention for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10089)
*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study focuses on optimizing hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, using an information-theoretic framework to allocate latent dimensions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the sensitivity of HVAEs' performance to arbitrary latent capacity allocation, which often results in poor representations or posterior collapse.

Method: The authors developed an information-theoretic framework to optimize latent dimension allocation, proving the existence of an optimal allocation ratio and empirically testing its impact on OOD detection.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the optimal allocation ratio consistently enhances OOD detection performance, outperforming standard HVAE setups across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for latent structure design in HVAEs, enabling more reliable OOD detection in deep generative models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

*Bingshan Hu,Zheng He,Danica J. Sutherland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses kernelized bandit problems by proposing computationally efficient algorithms called GP-Generic, based on exploration distributions, achieving competitive regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and algorithmic flexibility in solving kernelized bandit problems while maintaining competitive regret bounds.

Method: The method involves introducing GP-Generic algorithms focused on exploration distributions, enabling both UCB-based and randomized approaches.

Result: GP-Generic enables a wide range of algorithms achieving $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, matching existing approaches while showing potential for better practical performance via randomization.

Conclusion: The GP-Generic framework broadens the scope of kernelized bandit algorithms, providing a versatile solution with both theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-phase autoencoder architecture combined with clustering techniques to improve MNIST digit classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance unsupervised clustering for MNIST digits using interpretable embeddings to improve clustering performance in large-scale applications.

Method: The method involves a deep autoencoder with two phases: (1) training embeddings with minimal reconstruction error, (2) integrating K-Means clustering loss for superior clustering via joint objectives.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior clustering metrics using intrinsic (Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index) and extrinsic (NMI, ARI) evaluation, showing distinct digit clusters via t-SNE visualization.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully balances reconstruction accuracy and clustering purity. It ensures scalability and interpretable results for applying large-scale image clustering.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated multi-task learning method focusing on personalized learning by leveraging cross-client similarity and introducing communication-efficient strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve personalized federated learning for clients with heterogeneous data distributions by enabling efficient knowledge transfer and reducing communication overhead.

Method: The study introduces a feature anchor for compact client data representation, a lightweight linear classification head, and a dynamic graph-based collaboration model refined over time. A community detection mechanism is also implemented to ensure effective collaboration among similar clients.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significantly better performance compared to current baselines on two heterogeneous datasets, along with improved computational and communication efficiency, and enhanced client fairness.

Conclusion: Dynamic graph modeling and community detection enable robust and efficient federated multi-task learning, achieving better performance and fairness while addressing challenges in personalization and communication.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating complex natural objects like clouds is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. The authors aim to develop an alternative approach to make this process more efficient without compromising the physical accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, Nonnegative Diffusion (NnD), combines score-based diffusion models with annealed Langevin dynamics to ensure non-negativity during the generation and inference process. It trains on high-quality physically simulated datasets.

Result: The model successfully generates realistic 3D volumetric clouds with nonnegative microphysical fields, which align with cloud physics trends and are deemed physically plausible by experts.

Conclusion: Nonnegative Diffusion (NnD) can efficiently generate physically meaningful, computationally tractable objects like clouds, significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical realism.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based AL methods focus on static graph datasets and prediction accuracy, neglecting adaptability, diversity, and fairness in dynamic environments.

Method: The paper proposes GRAIL, a framework that utilizes novel metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden in dynamic, real-life settings.

Result: Experiments on dynamic human sensor data reveal trade-offs between prediction accuracy and user burden, showcasing limitations of existing AL methods and the benefits of GRAIL.

Conclusion: GRAIL highlights the importance of balancing node importance, sampling diversity, and network topology, enabling better evaluation of AL strategies in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The paper addresses decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits with no sensing, introducing a new algorithm called A-CAPELLA to handle unknown arm capacities and achieve logarithmic regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the decentralized multi-armed bandits problem in settings where players have no sensing of collisions and arm capacities are unknown.

Method: Developed A-CAPELLA algorithm, employing collaborative hypothesis testing and structured collision patterns to synchronize elimination and estimate arm capacity.

Result: Achieved logarithmic regret in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm capacities, proving efficient learning and coordination capabilities.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that A-CAPELLA effectively handles challenges of decentralized MMAB with no-sensing in scenarios with unknown capacities, enabling efficient learning and allocation.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, over the Beran estimator in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The novel survival models effectively improve survival analysis for censored data, and iSurvJ stands out as the best-performing model across metrics. The codes are publicly available.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

### [217] [Provable Sim-to-Real Transfer via Offline Domain Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10133)
*Arnaud Fickinger,Abderrahim Bendahi,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Offline Domain Randomization (ODR) as a way to bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in reinforcement learning, enhancing the approach with theoretical foundations and introducing an improved method called E-DROPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement-learning agents often fail to perform effectively when transferring from simulations to real-world scenarios, and domain randomization methods tend to neglect available offline real-world data.

Method: The authors formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood estimation over a parametric simulator family, proving its consistency under certain conditions, deriving tighter bounds on sim-to-real transfer errors, and introducing E-DROPO with an entropy bonus to improve robustness.

Result: They demonstrate that ODR achieves tighter sim-to-real transfer error bounds than standard domain randomization and that E-DROPO enhances the robustness by promoting broader randomization.

Conclusion: ODR can outperform standard domain randomization by better utilizing offline data, and the new E-DROPO variant yields more reliable real-world performance through improved variance management.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

### [218] [Probabilistic Variational Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10159)
*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL) to introduce uncertainty quantification to contrastive learning. VCL achieves probabilistic embeddings and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contrastive learning methods lack a way to quantify uncertainty in their embeddings, despite achieving high performance.

Method: VCL uses a decoder-free framework by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with a KL divergence regularizer. It employs a projected normal distribution for sampling probabilistic embeddings.

Result: VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, matches or outperforms baselines in accuracy, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL provides contrastive learning with a probabilistic framework, enhancing both accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and can serve as a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

*Daniel Lawson,Adriana Hugessen,Charlotte Cloutier,Glen Berseth,Khimya Khetarpal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BYOL-γ augmented GCBC, a novel representation learning objective that enhances goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) by approximating successor representations without contrastive samples or temporal-difference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional goal-conditioned behavior cloning methods lack combinatorial generalization due to insufficient temporal consistency in the latent state representation. Improving this could allow for better zero-shot generalization to novel state-goal pairs.

Method: The proposed BYOL-γ objective theoretically approximates successor representations by encouraging temporal consistency in the state representation, without relying on contrastive samples or temporal difference (TD) learning.

Result: BYOL-γ augmented GCBC outperforms prior methods in tasks requiring combinatorial generalization, achieving competitive empirical results.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal consistency into the representation space using BYOL-γ enhances goal-conditioned behavior cloning, paving the way for more generalizable and effective policies in robotics and other domains.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

*Defang Chen,Zhenyu Zhou,Can Wang,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the geometric behavior of sampling trajectories in diffusion-based generative models, identifying a consistent 'boomerang' trajectory shape and proposing an improved sampling method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the understanding of sampling mechanisms within diffusion-based generative models and improve their efficiency and performance.

Method: They study geometric regularities in deterministic sampling trajectories using kernel-estimated data modeling and propose a dynamic programming scheme to optimize sampling time schedules.

Result: A low-dimensional 'boomerang' shape in sampling trajectories is discovered as a universal property across models. The proposed sampling method improves efficiency with minimal computational overhead while enhancing image generation quality.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a universal geometric property of sampling trajectories in diffusion models and offer a practical optimization method that boosts performance with negligible modifications to existing systems.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study analyzes a convolutional recurrent neural network trained for Sokoban, highlighting analogies to search algorithms and specific learned mechanisms, while uncovering differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of a neural network trained with reinforcement learning for Sokoban, focusing on how it utilizes test-time compute to improve performance.

Method: Partial reverse engineering of the neural network to analyze its trained behaviors, specifically focusing on planning and pruning mechanisms via state-action activations and kernel functions.

Result: The neural network employs mechanisms analogous to bidirectional search (e.g., plan representations, value functions, backtracking) but also unique approaches like independent box considerations and layer-specific representations.

Conclusion: The Sokoban-solving network learned understandable, familiar mechanisms despite being trained model-free, and its operations partially resemble classical search algorithms.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a meta-learning method to train classifiers using annotations from multiple noisy annotators, utilizing data from related tasks when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training accurate classifiers when annotations from multiple sources are noisy and labeled data is insufficient.

Method: Embed examples into a latent space using neural networks, apply a probabilistic model to factor in noise from annotators, and adapt classifiers using the EM algorithm during meta-learning.

Result: The proposed method shows improved performance on both synthetic noisy datasets and real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages limited labeled data and estimations of annotator abilities, offering a practical solution for noisy and limited data scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

*Yaowen Zhang,Libera Fresiello,Peter H. Veltink,Dirk W. Donker,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new neural network framework integrating physiological principles to improve heart rate (HR) estimation during daily activities, showing high accuracy and outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global challenge of heart failure (HF) by improving early detection through reliable and individualized heart rate (HR) monitoring, which overcomes the limitations of population-based methods.

Method: The study develops a physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) that incorporates a simplified human movement physiological model to estimate HR using oxygen uptake (VO2) data during various activities.

Result: The PMB-NN achieved a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm, matching the performance of benchmark models and outperforming traditional physiological models (p=0.002).

Conclusion: The PMB-NN framework is a promising tool for real-time and personalized cardiac monitoring, with potential applications in early detection and management of heart failure.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

*Moïse Blanchard,Vineet Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of shared exploration in grouped multi-armed bandit settings and introduces the Col-UCB algorithm to coordinate exploration effectively across groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of balancing exploration burdens among different groups in multi-armed bandit scenarios, where standard algorithms often lead to disproportionate exploration costs between groups.

Method: The authors propose a new algorithm, Col-UCB, which coordinates exploration dynamically across groups to minimize the collaborative regret.

Result: Col-UCB achieves optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) and adapts efficiently to the shared action set structures between groups.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that collaboration in exploration, facilitated by Col-UCB, can significantly outperform independent group learning under the right structural conditions.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

*Tejaswi Kasarla,Max van Spengler,Pascal Mettes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that hierarchical hyperbolic embedding improves out-of-distribution recognition performance and introduces Balanced Hyperbolic Learning to achieve this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper emphasizes the importance of addressing out-of-distribution recognition, which filters out samples outside the training distribution, to improve robustness in deep learning.

Method: The authors introduce Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, leveraging an optimized hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that balances distortion and hierarchy, utilizing these embeddings for in-distribution classification and generalized scoring functions.

Result: Empirical evaluation across 13 datasets and scoring functions revealed superior performance of hyperbolic embeddings compared to existing methods, including state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings are more effective for out-of-distribution recognition and enable hierarchical generalization, outperforming contemporary methods and algorithms.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of sparse air pollution sensors in developing countries, which fail to provide localized insights into AQI.

Method: The authors utilized Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to make fine-grained AQI predictions at the 1 km^2 level using the AirDelhi dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieved significant accuracy improvements, reducing the mean squared error by 79%, and providing insights into AQI patterns and spatial relations.

Conclusion: Fine-grained AQI predictions are possible using advanced machine learning approaches like Spatio-temporal GNNs, enabling better environmental monitoring and decision-making.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using causal representation learning to explicitly disentangle the latent capability factors influencing language model performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of language modeling capabilities faces challenges like confounders and computational costs; the study aims to isolate causal relationships among latent model abilities.

Method: A framework models benchmark performance as linear transformations of latent factors, controlled for base model confounding, applied to data from 1500 models evaluated on 6 benchmarks.

Result: Identified a three-node causal structure describing performance, revealing a progression from problem-solving to instruction-following and finally to mathematical reasoning capability.

Conclusion: Carefully controlling base model variations is essential for deriving robust causal insights into language model performance and achieving more accurate evaluations.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and
Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits
and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes WBSAC, a new reinforcement learning algorithm combining pessimistic and optimistic actors to enhance sample efficiency in sparse-reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms are limited by poor sample efficiency, particularly in sparse reward continuous control environments.

Method: The proposed WBSAC algorithm combines a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor for exploration. It uses the Wasserstein barycenter of these policies as the exploration policy and dynamically adjusts exploration levels during training.

Result: WBSAC was tested against state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and demonstrated greater sample efficiency on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: WBSAC is a promising strategy for improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning and provides a principled approach to directed exploration.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

### [230] [Size-adaptive Hypothesis Testing for Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10586)
*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework for fairness assessment in algorithmic decision-making systems, addressing limitations in current practices due to sampling error and small subgroup sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the statistical limitations in fairness assessments, especially when analyzing small or intersectional demographic subgroups where data sparsity leads to unreliable estimation and excessively wide confidence intervals.

Method: The authors present a size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing framework. For large subgroups, they prove a Central-Limit result for statistical parity difference. For smaller groups, they propose a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator for credible intervals. The framework combines these approaches to make fairness assessment evidence-based.

Result: Validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed tests enable interpretable and statistically valid assessments, even under conditions of limited data and higher intersectionality.

Conclusion: The framework enhances fairness assessments by offering a statistically rigorous and size-adaptive approach, overcoming challenges of data sparsity and ensuring meaningful conclusions for all demographic groups.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

*Mohammad Subhi Al-Batah,Mowafaq Salem Alzboon,Muhyeeddin Alqaraleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of feature selection and dimensionality reduction on MLP network performance using three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how feature engineering techniques like GA and PCA influence MLP performance across diverse datasets.

Method: Three key approaches: baseline MLP training, GA-based feature selection, and PCA-based dimensional reduction.

Result: PCA improves performance in simpler, noise-free datasets, while GA enhances accuracy by selecting critical features in complex datasets.

Conclusion: Feature selection and dimensionality reduction are interlinked and significantly improve MLP performance across diverse machine learning tasks.

Abstract: This study conducts an empirical examination of MLP networks investigated
through a rigorous methodical experimentation process involving three diverse
datasets: TinyFace, Heart Disease, and Iris. Study Overview: The study includes
three key methods: a) a baseline training using the default settings for the
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), b) feature selection using Genetic Algorithm (GA)
based refinement c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based dimension
reduction. The results show important information on how such techniques affect
performance. While PCA had showed benefits in low-dimensional and noise-free
datasets GA consistently increased accuracy in complex datasets by accurately
identifying critical features. Comparison reveals that feature selection and

### [233] [Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982)
*Sebastian Sanokowski,Lukas Gruber,Christoph Bartmann,Sepp Hochreiter,Sebastian Lehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the reverse Kullback-Leibler loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) outperforms the Log Variance (LV) loss for training diffusion bridges, both conceptually and practically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the efficacy of loss functions like LV loss and rKL in the context of diffusion bridges, as these methods are increasingly used for sampling from unnormalized distributions using deep learning.

Method: The authors analyze the conceptual issues of the LV loss, contrast it with rKL loss using the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD), and benchmark their performance on diffusion bridges across challenging datasets.

Result: Their findings conclude that the rKL-LD loss not only avoids conceptual pitfalls associated with the LV loss but also consistently achieves better experimental results, requiring less hyperparameter tuning and improving training stability.

Conclusion: The reverse Kullback-Leibler loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) is a more reliable and effective optimization objective for training diffusion bridges compared to the LV loss.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

*Yuhui Ding,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to generating 3D molecules by using a non-equivariant diffusion model with aligned latent spaces, achieving competitive performance while improving scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in scalability and efficiency posed by existing SE(3)-equivariant architectures in 3D molecule generation.

Method: The method involves learning a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation to align molecules into a latent space, which is then used to train a non-equivariant diffusion model.

Result: The results show that the proposed approach outperforms non-equivariant models and achieves sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, along with better training and sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that relaxing equivariance constraints can lead to models that are both effective and efficient for 3D molecule generation, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

### [236] [DynaSubVAE: Adaptive Subgrouping for Scalable and Robust OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10200)
*Tina Behrouzi,Sana Tonekaboni,Rahul G. Krishnan,Anna Goldenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE introduces a framework combining dynamic representation learning and adaptive OOD detection, leveraging non-parametric clustering, and improving prediction accuracy for underrepresented subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to adapt to underrepresented or emerging subpopulations, leading to inaccuracies or harmful predictions. Current approaches often rely solely on OOD detection without addressing the underlying need for model adaptability.

Method: The paper proposes DynaSubVAE, a framework using a dynamic latent structure and non-parametric clustering inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models to identify and adapt to new trends in data. It combines representation learning with adaptive OOD detection.

Result: DynaSubVAE achieves competitive OOD detection performance, particularly excelling in class-OOD scenarios where training data lacks entire classes. It also outperforms traditional clustering approaches like GMM and KMeans++ in OOD accuracy and regret precision.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE dynamically evolves with data, effectively identifying and addressing underrepresented subgroups, thereby offering a robust improvement over conventional methods in both OOD detection and subgroup modeling.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are computationally expensive and difficult to deploy on edge devices. To facilitate their usage, there's a need for effective model compression techniques like quantization and pruning.

Method: The paper proposes a unified method called Activation-aware Weight Pruning and quantization via Projected Gradient Descent (AWP), inspired by Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) and sparse approximation problems.

Result: The proposed AWP method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art pruning and quantization techniques for LLMs.

Conclusion: AWP offers an effective compression solution for LLMs, improving quantization and pruning methods, and is supported by theoretical convergence guarantees for pruning.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates the relationship between ECG and PCG signals using the EPHNOGRAM dataset, revealing that nonlinear models, especially non-causal LSTM, perform best for cross-modal reconstruction and extracting clinically relevant biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand the overlapping and distinct information content of ECG and PCG signals, particularly their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction in varying conditions and across individuals.

Method: The authors use the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings and a range of machine learning models, including linear and nonlinear models like non-causal LSTM, to study cross-modal reconstruction under different physiological and individual conditions.

Result: Nonlinear models, especially non-causal LSTM, showed superior performance for reconstructing ECG from PCG. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios posed challenges but were mitigated by envelope-based modeling using amplitude features. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers were successfully estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: The research advances our understanding of ECG-PCG signal relationships and demonstrates their potential for multimodal cardiac monitoring, with implications for clinical biomarker estimation and improving generalizability across subjects.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DC-Clustering enhances federated clustering by handling complex data partitioning scenarios and achieving results comparable to centralized approaches while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to utilize sensitive data in privacy-sensitive domains while maintaining privacy has heightened interest in federated learning, particularly for complex data partitioning.

Method: Proposes DC-Clustering, a federated clustering technique sharing intermediate representations instead of raw data and allowing flexible choice between k-means and spectral clustering, with a single communication round with the central server.

Result: Experiments show that DC-Clustering performs comparably to centralized clustering across synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills a gap in federated learning by making knowledge discovery feasible over distributed heterogeneous data in a privacy-efficient manner, making it suitable for domains like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores semidefinite programming (SDP) for neural network verification, identifies a limitation (interior-point vanishing) that scales poorly with deeper networks, and proposes solutions to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and applicability of SDP-based neural network verification methods and address fundamental barriers in scaling to deeper neural networks.

Method: The study identifies the interior-point vanishing issue, conducts theoretical and empirical analysis, and proposes five new methods to enhance feasibility conditions for SDP verification.

Result: The proposed methods successfully solved 88% of previously unsolvable cases, representing 41% of the total problems analyzed.

Conclusion: The research highlights the challenges of using SDP in deep neural network verification and presents practical solutions, improving the field’s capacity to develop secure and reliable deep learning systems.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Graph-MLLM" as a unified benchmark to evaluate multimodal graph learning, comparing different paradigms based on how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) interact with graph data. Findings highlight the value of visual-text integration and fine-tuning for performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating learning methods applied to multimodal graphs in real-world applications like social networks and healthcare.

Method: Graph-MLLM systematically evaluates three approaches (MLLM-as-Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor) across six datasets from various domains. Experiments test the effects of multimodal integration, representation conversion, and fine-tuning.

Result: Integrating textual and visual node attributes improves graph learning, and converting visual to textual representations boosts performance further. Fine-tuning MLLMs achieves state-of-the-art results without requiring explicit graph structure data.

Conclusion: The developed benchmark and insights are expected to promote fair evaluation and inspire future improvements in multimodal graph learning methodologies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using meta-learning to detect malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia, showing enhanced precision and releasing a new dataset for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia, especially when text data is limited and traditional methods fail to model specific sockpuppet-group behavior.

Method: The study applies meta-learning, a technique that optimizes models for quick adaptation to new tasks, focusing on tailoring to the writing style of specific sockpuppet-groups.

Result: The results indicate that meta-learning improves prediction precision significantly compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Meta-learning demonstrates its effectiveness in combating sockpuppetry on platforms like Wikipedia, offering an improved detection method and advancing research with a new dataset.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO is a PyTorch-based library for learned optimizers, offering improved accessibility, speed, and integration with optimization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to make advanced learned optimizers, like VeLO, more accessible to the broader machine learning community by addressing the reliance on JAX and lack of user-friendly packages.

Method: PyLO uses a CUDA-accelerated implementation of an existing architecture (small_fc_lopt) and integrates with PyTorch workflows, focusing on real-world, large-scale pre-training tasks.

Result: PyLO achieves significant speed improvements in training (e.g., from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec for specific tasks) and enables the combination of learned optimizers with tools like learning rate schedules and weight decay.

Conclusion: PyLO democratizes access to learned optimizers, enhancing their practicality and performance in large-scale machine learning tasks. Code is made available for community use.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem and introduces the transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure, proposing the HELiX algorithm to solve LLF problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models are increasingly used for interactive learning, but a principled framework for these decision problems has been lacking.

Method: The authors formalize the LLF problem, introduce the transfer eluder dimension to measure complexity, and propose the HELiX algorithm for efficient learning using structured assumptions.

Result: The transfer eluder dimension enables faster learning from rich language feedback compared to rewards. The HELiX algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance even when language model prompting is unreliable.

Conclusion: The work is a significant step forward in designing formal interactive learning methods from language feedback.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel wavelet-based approach and pretrained models for physiological signal analysis, overcoming challenges like low-SNR disturbances and non-stationarity, and achieving superior performance in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physiological signals are hard to analyze due to motion artifacts, non-stationarity, and disturbances like low-SNR, making traditional methods inadequate.

Method: The authors introduce wavelet-based models for EMG and ECG, as well as a unified multimodal framework integrating EEG, with a learnable weighted fusion technique.

Result: The approach successfully tackled noise, variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods in both domain-specific and multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: The work sets a foundation for enhanced physiological signal processing, with potential applications in wearable health monitoring, diagnostics, and biomedical innovations.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of modeling path-dependent inelastic material behavior, a process driven by hidden dynamics, using observable data while overcoming inconsistencies in existing methodologies such as RNN-based models.

Method: HANO integrates a Fourier-based neural operator to ensure discretization-invariant learning and embeds hierarchical self-attention mechanisms for multiscale feature extraction, avoiding reliance on hidden state variables.

Result: HANO demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, robust generalization, and resilience under complex conditions like irregular sampling and noisy data compared to baseline models across two benchmark problems.

Conclusion: HANO is an effective data-driven surrogate for simulating path-dependent inelastic materials and holds potential for integration with traditional numerical solvers.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

*Yu-Yang Qian,Yuan-Ze Xu,Zhen-Yu Zhang,Peng Zhao,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes TreeLoRA, a method for efficient continual learning (CL) in large pre-trained models (LPMs) via hierarchical low-rank adapters and sparse gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of continual learning in data-streaming environments, especially for computationally demanding large pre-trained models, while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Develops TreeLoRA, which uses hierarchical gradient-based low-rank adapters and bandit algorithms for task similarity estimation. It employs sparse updates to optimize parameters efficiently for large models.

Result: TreeLoRA is empirically validated on vision transformers and large language models, showing effective performance across vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA offers a theoretically justified, computationally efficient solution for continual learning in large model contexts, suitable for diverse domains.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark task to study property inference attacks on LLMs fine-tuned for specialized domains, and demonstrates attack strategies that reveal vulnerabilities in these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned LLMs for specialized domains (e.g., healthcare, law) may inadvertently leak sensitive dataset properties, raising potential privacy risks.

Method: Development of PropInfer benchmark and two new attack approaches: a generation attack using prompts and a shadow-model attack based on word frequency signals.

Result: Empirical tests on multiple pretrained LLMs show these tailored attacks can infer sensitive dataset properties, uncovering vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs fine-tuned on sensitive data are susceptible to property inference attacks, emphasizing the need for improved privacy-preserving fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper presents EQA-RM, a generative multimodal reward model tailored for Embodied Question Answering tasks that interprets agent behavior with nuanced rewards. It introduces a novel training strategy, C-GRPO, and achieves high accuracy on a new benchmark (EQARewardBench) while outperforming other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models are essential for aligning large models but lack exploration in evaluating complex embodied tasks, such as EQA, which demand nuanced assessments of spatial, temporal, and logical understanding.

Method: The authors introduce EQA-RM, trained using Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) to identify fine-grained behavior distinctions. Its generative nature allows dynamic evaluation feedback during inference.

Result: EQA-RM achieves 61.9% accuracy on EQARewardBench with only 700 samples, outperforming proprietary and open-source baselines like Gemini-2.5-Flash, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Haiku, RoVRM, and VisualPRM.

Conclusion: EQA-RM provides interpretable evaluation feedback and sample-efficient accuracy, proving effective and scalable for nuanced EQA assessments.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple
scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation
granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward
model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning

*Bryan Shaddy,Brianna Binder,Agnimitra Dasgupta,Haitong Qin,James Haley,Angel Farguell,Kyle Hilburn,Derek V. Mallia,Adam Kochanski,Jan Mandel,Assad Oberai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to estimate wildfire progression using satellite data and machine learning, achieving high accuracy in prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the divergence of existing wildfire models from actual wildfire progression during multi-day simulations, emphasizing the need for improved data assimilation techniques.

Method: The study leverages VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, terrain height data, and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on simulations from WRF-SFIRE to estimate wildfire progression represented as fire arrival times.

Result: The method was validated on five wildfires in the Pacific US, achieving an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81 and showing minimal terrain influence when inference is conditioned on satellite measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates data from wildfire simulations and satellite measurements to improve predictions of wildfire progression, demonstrating potential for high accuracy and minimal dependency on terrain.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed for real-world irregular, multimodal time series data and IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting in such scenarios. These resources aim to close the gap between idealized assumptions in research and the complexities of real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between existing benchmarks and real-world multimodal time series data, which are irregular, messy, and asynchronous, by creating specialized tools for better analysis and forecasting.

Method: Time-IMM introduces nine categorized types of time series irregularity causes, while IMM-TSF features advanced fusion modules for integrating asynchronous and multimodal data using recency-aware and attention-based techniques.

Result: Empirical results show substantial improvements in forecasting performance when multimodality and irregularity are explicitly modeled with the proposed dataset and benchmark library.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF create a new foundation for realistic time series analysis, enabling researchers to address challenges inherent in real-world data with better tools.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method combining spectral clustering with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling to enhance soil organic carbon sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC monitoring often neglects effective representation of minor environmental variations and relies heavily on covariates.

Method: Utilizes spectral clustering to segment regions into homogeneous zones and applies cLHS within these zones for comprehensive sampling.

Result: The hybrid spectral-cLHS method demonstrated better spatial and covariate representation compared to standard cLHS in experiments.

Conclusion: This approach improves SOC prediction accuracy by generating balanced and representative training data for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability
for system identification in modern industrial systems.

Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in

We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),

Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of optimizing PCB designs, which is hindered by a shortage of skilled engineers and the time-intensive nature of manual work. Neglecting optimizations leads to increased troubleshooting costs, shorter product life cycles, and electronic waste.

Method: The authors represent PCB schematics as bipartite graphs and employ node pair prediction models using various GNN architectures to automate the process of adding components.

Result: The approach achieves high accuracy in solving three PCB design optimization tasks, as validated on real-world datasets labeled by experts.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based method offers a scalable, accurate, and cost-efficient way to automate PCB design optimizations, potentially reducing waste and development costs.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves dynamic regret minimization for non-stationary online learning using mixability, achieving a better dynamic regret bound for mixable losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in dynamic regret minimization methods by focusing on functions with stronger curvature (e.g., squared or logistic loss) rather than just convex functions.

Method: The paper employs an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates and uses mixability to achieve a tighter dynamic regret bound.

Result: The method achieves an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses, improving greatly on the dimensionality dependence compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This improvement showcases the power of combining mixability and a simpler analytical framework, avoiding reliance on more complex existing techniques.

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method involving U-Net-based segmentation and adaptive grid detection for accurately digitizing ECG recordings, especially in challenging overlapping scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with digitizing ECG data in cases where signal overlaps compromise single leads. A robust, accurate technique is needed to address this critical challenge in medical data digitization.

Method: A two-stage pipeline was designed: (1) A U-Net-based segmentation network isolates ECG traces, trained with overlapping signals and enriched via custom data augmentations, and (2) a binary mask is converted into time-series data using enhanced digitization techniques and an adaptive grid detection module.

Result: The method outperforms a baseline in both non-overlapping and overlapping samples. Results include an IoU of 0.87 for segmentation, MSE of 0.0010 and rho of 0.9644 for non-overlapping samples, and MSE of 0.0029 and rho of 0.9641 for overlapping samples—significantly better than the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of ECG digitization, particularly in challenging scenarios with signal overlaps, making it a promising solution for clinical data processing. The implementation is publicly available for replication or further research.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

*Thu Ha Phi,Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer,Florent Bouchard,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a low-rank graph learning framework for efficiently estimating undirected graphs from node-specific data, optimizing large-scale problems in graph signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in learning undirected graphs from node-specific data, where the graph topology is linked to the conditional correlation matrix, and existing methods struggle with scalability at high dimensions.

Method: A low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix is employed, combined with Riemannian optimization techniques. The approach is applied to a constrained variation of the GLasso algorithm for Gaussian graphical models.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate effective trade-offs between computational dimension and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently addresses the scalability issue in graph learning, presenting a promising method for high-dimensional graph estimation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

*Yucheng Yang,Tianyi Zhou,Qiang He,Lei Han,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancements to unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) methods by introducing new metrics and objectives for improved downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in URL, which lacks theoretical analysis and does not ensure effective skill diversity and separability.

Method: The paper introduces the disentanglement metric LSEPIN, connects it to downstream task adaptation cost, replaces KL divergence with Wasserstein distance in skill-learning objectives, and proposes new algorithms WSEP and PWSEP.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved adaptation cost and discovery of more optimal initial policies for downstream tasks using WSEP and PWSEP compared to MISL.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches advance URL by ensuring skill diversity and separability, leading to better initial policy discovery and downstream task adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

### [262] [Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10630)
*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a reinforcement fine-tuning framework, Time-R1, enhancing LLMs for accurate time series forecasting through reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSF methods rely on historical patterns, lacking reasoning, and alternatives like LLMs are limited by prompt engineering drawbacks.

Method: Two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning (supervised warmup, reinforcement learning with fine-grained rewards and GRIP optimization).

Result: Time-R1 improves forecast accuracy across datasets by fostering multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: Time-R1 offers a novel approach to develop reasoning for TSF in LLMs, addressing existing limitations and enhancing predictive performance.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to explore the latent space geometry of generative models using Fisher information metric, and discovers fractal phase transitions in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the latent space geometry in generative models and uncover phenomena like phase transitions, which are currently not well-explored.

Method: The authors reconstruct the Fisher information metric by approximating posterior distributions of latent variables, learning the log-partition function, and validating the model's performance on Ising, TASEP, and diffusion models.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in reconstructing thermodynamic properties, reveals fractal phase transitions in diffusion models, and identifies divergences in the latent space at phase boundaries.

Conclusion: The findings expose the rich complexity of latent spaces in generative models, linking them to phase transitions and offering a deeper understanding with practical implications for model usage and design.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning performs under data shifts, particularly focusing on the $k$-parity problem, highlighting unexpected drawbacks and providing the underlying mechanistic explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the limitations of CoT reasoning in real-world scenarios where training data assumptions, such as identical distributions and corruption-free data, may not hold.

Method: The study investigates the joint effects of data distribution shifts and data poisoning on the performance of models trained using CoT decomposition, focusing on the $k$-parity problem.

Result: CoT reasoning performs worse than direct prediction generation in the presence of data shifts, demonstrating a surprising phenomenon and elucidating its mechanistic causes.

Conclusion: Under real-world data challenges like distribution shifts, CoT reasoning might not always outperform simpler methods, necessitating further exploration and adaptation of CoT-based techniques.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM), a mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Self-Organizing Maps during continual learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in neural systems, which is a significant limitation in continual learning, specifically in Self-Organizing Maps.

Method: SatSOM utilizes a saturation mechanism to gradually reduce learning rate and neighborhood radius as neurons accumulate information, effectively freezing well-trained neurons.

Result: The saturation mechanism ensures that already trained neurons retain their learned knowledge while redistributing learning efforts to underutilized areas of the map.

Conclusion: SatSOM successfully enhances knowledge retention in continual learning applications, mitigating the challenges of catastrophic forgetting in Self-Organizing Maps.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

*Floris Holstege,Shauli Ravfogel,Bram Wouters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE is a method to remove undesired concepts from neural network representations while preserving label covariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on addressing the fairness and interpretability concerns in neural networks due to the encoding of unwanted concepts alongside task-related information.

Method: The authors propose SPLICE, which utilizes an oblique projection to eliminate undesirable concepts while maintaining covariance with the target label, ensuring minimal impact on the representation.

Result: SPLICE outperforms existing methods in removing sensitive attributes while preserving critical task-relevant information on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias.

Conclusion: SPLICE uniquely solves the problem of concept removal with minimal embedding distortion and covariance preservation, making it effective for fairness and interpretability concerns.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

*Marco Spinaci,Marek Polewczyk,Maximilian Schambach,Sam Thelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConTextTab, an innovative tabular in-context learning framework that combines semantic understanding and efficiency, achieving competitive performance and establishing a new standard on a semantic-rich benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the efficiency of table-native frameworks with the semantic understanding of large language models, addressing limitations of current approaches trained only on synthetic data or constrained by architectural limitations.

Method: ConTextTab utilizes specialized embeddings for diverse data modalities and trains on large-scale real-world tabular datasets within a table-native ICL framework.

Result: ConTextTab achieves competitive performance across benchmarks and sets a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTextTab integrates semantic alignment into a table-native ICL approach, effectively combining the strengths of architectural efficiency and semantic understanding for tabular prediction tasks.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for effective clinical question answering using electronic health records, achieving high accuracy via optimized prompts rather than model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge information gaps in healthcare by enabling precise and reliable automated question answering using electronic health records.

Method: The task is decoupled into evidence identification and answer synthesis stages, with automated prompt optimization using DSPy's MIPROv2. Self-consistency voting enhances recall without compromising precision.

Result: Achieved an overall score of 51.5 in the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task, significantly outperforming standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods.

Conclusion: Data-driven prompt optimization offers a cost-efficient and reliable alternative to model fine-tuning for clinical QA, bolstering AI's dependability in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FGN, a machine learning model for weather forecasting that outperforms state-of-the-art models by using learned model perturbations to improve ensemble predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy, speed, and spatial representation of weather forecasting using machine learning techniques over traditional numerical weather prediction models.

Method: The paper employs FGN, a model that generates weather forecast ensembles through learned model perturbations and trains these ensembles via CRPS optimization at a per-location level. The approach ensures scalability and flexibility while maintaining probabilistic accuracy.

Result: The proposed FGN model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting metrics. It produces accurate tropical cyclone track predictions and captures spatial correlations effectively.

Conclusion: The FGN approach is a significant advancement in ML-based weather forecasting, offering superior accuracy and speed compared to existing models while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

### [270] [Monotone Classification with Relative Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10775)
*Yufei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies creating a monotone classifier in high-dimensional spaces using minimal label revelations while achieving near-optimal error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for monotone classification do not provide relative-error guarantees, only absolute ones, limiting precision.

Method: The authors analyze the cost versus error trade-offs and propose nearly matching upper and lower bounds for achieving relative error guarantees.

Result: They demonstrate algorithms that ensure an error at most $(1 + ε) \cdot k^*$ and provide theoretical cost bounds for the whole range of $ε$.

Conclusion: This study sets a foundation for efficient, near-optimal monotone classifiers with improved error-cost balance, advancing theoretical understanding in monotone classification.

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the log-sum-ReLU (LSR) function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) networks, showcasing advantages in memory storage and generative capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve DenseAM networks by enhancing memory capacity and retrieval while fostering emergent properties.

Method: LSR energy function, inspired by Epanechnikov kernel, replaces the log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, creating exact memory retrieval without needing exponential separation functions.

Result: LSR achieves exponential memory capacity and introduces emergent local minima, validated empirically, with creative memory characteristics noted in image datasets.

Conclusion: LSR offers significant advancements in DenseAM networks, bridging memory storage capacity and creativity, suggesting its utility for generative tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: This paper investigates using activation probes to identify interactions with LLMs that might result in significant harm, demonstrating their effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore underdeveloped methods, such as activation probes, for monitoring high-risk interactions with LLMs due to the potential harm such interactions can cause.

Method: Evaluating multiple activation probe architectures using synthetic data and measuring their generalization capabilities on real-world data, with comparisons to medium-sized LLM performance.

Result: Probes performed robustly, generalizing well to diverse datasets, and achieving performance comparable to medium-sized monitors while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Activation probes are an effective and resource-efficient method for monitoring high-stakes interactions in LLMs, and they can be integrated into hierarchical monitoring systems for cost-effective oversight.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: The paper studies new vulnerabilities in dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) arising from their adaptive behavior, introduces a taxonomy of efficiency attacks, and highlights the need for better defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the increasing use of DDLSs in efficiency-critical applications like mobile and IoT devices, and the necessity to address new vulnerabilities introduced by dynamic behavior in these systems.

Method: A systematic exploration of efficiency robustness in DDLSs, developing a taxonomy to classify efficiency attacks based on three types of dynamic behaviors. The paper also evaluates adversarial strategies and existing defense mechanisms.

Result: The findings demonstrate various efficiency attacks targeting the adaptive mechanisms of DDLSs and reveal limitations in current defense approaches, emphasizing the need for novel security measures.

Conclusion: The dynamic nature of DDLSs introduces unique efficiency vulnerabilities that require new defense strategies to ensure their secure and reliable operation in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning framework to detect credit card transaction fraud by combining data engineering, feature extraction, and various unsupervised learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of digital payments necessitates intelligent systems for fraud detection to mitigate potential financial risks.

Method: The study integrates multiple datasets, employs feature extraction techniques to identify behavioral signals, and applies unsupervised learning models like Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and deep autoencoders for detecting fraud.

Result: Top 1% of transactions flagged as outliers based on reconstruction errors. PCA visualizations and clustering methods provided insights into fraudulent and normal transaction patterns.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning and data enrichment effectively identify anomalies in transactions, making it a scalable solution for real-world fraud detection.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects entropy regularization with robust safety in reinforcement learning, analyzing its effects on constraint satisfaction under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the unresolved issue of learning policies that robustly meet state constraints despite unknown disturbances in reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors analyze the interplay between entropy regularization and constraints penalization, reformulating constrained RL problems to approximate unconstrained ones for improved resilience and efficiency.

Result: It is shown empirically that entropy regularization enhances the ability to satisfy constraints robustly by biasing actions towards future viability, while relaxing strict constraints improves resilience to disturbances.

Conclusion: The connection between entropy regularization and robust safety reveals an effective approach for achieving safety and optimality in RL through reward shaping, which merits further investigation.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

TL;DR: The paper explores a new attack strategy called the 'lattice climber attack' for finite mixtures of classifiers to overcome limitations in current adversarial attack methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy of existing adversarial attack methods on finite mixtures of classifiers and to propose a principled approach to improve attack robustness.

Method: A geometrical analysis is conducted to define two desired properties for attacks (effectiveness and maximality). The paper introduces the 'lattice climber attack' with theoretical backing in binary linear settings.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed lattice climber attack in overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the lattice climber attack addresses deficiencies in existing methods and meets the introduced properties, enhancing our understanding of attacking randomized ensembles.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Motivation: The performance gap between uniform-state discrete diffusion models and more effective autoregressive or masked diffusion models prompted the research, given the potential of uniform-state models to enable faster text generation with self-correction.

Method: The authors design a method called Duo that incorporates Gaussian diffusion techniques. It includes a Gaussian-based curriculum learning strategy to reduce variance and improve training speed, and Discrete Consistency Distillation to enable faster sampling through few-step generation.

Result: The proposed Duo method reduces training time by half and surpasses autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 out of 7 benchmarks. Additionally, it accelerates text generation sampling by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Duo significantly narrows the performance gap between uniform-state discrete diffusion models and other text generation approaches by improving both training efficiency and sampling speed, making it competitive with state-of-the-art autoregressive models.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

### [278] [NoLoCo: No-all-reduce Low Communication Training Method for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10911)
*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents NoLoCo, a novel training optimization method for large language models that avoids explicit synchronization of all model parameters, significantly reducing communication overhead while achieving faster convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models on extensive clusters is costly and relies on high-bandwidth networks, creating a bottleneck for scaling. Existing methods reduce communication but still require costly synchronization steps among all model replicas, especially on low-bandwidth networks.

Method: NoLoCo replaces explicit synchronization with implicit synchronization through a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer. Parameters are partially averaged with randomly selected models, removing the need for collective communication.

Result: NoLoCo demonstrates significantly reduced communication overhead compared to fully sharded data parallel training and even DiLoCo. Its synchronization step is faster by an order of magnitude, and it reduces accelerator idling time. It also achieves up to 4% faster convergence rates across model sizes (125M-6.8B parameters) and various accelerator counts.

Conclusion: NoLoCo offers an efficient and scalable alternative for training large language models, especially in environments with low bandwidth, by maximizing convergence speed and minimizing communication costs without global blocking synchronization.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Emil Javurek,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalFM is introduced as a framework that leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) for causal inference, combining Bayesian priors and structural causal models to estimate conditional effects effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance causal inference methods using PFNs, addressing limitations in current practices for applications in fields like medicine and economics.

Method: The framework builds on structural causal models (SCMs) to formalize Bayesian priors, integrates causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks, and trains PFNs specifically for causal inference tasks.

Result: CausalFM demonstrates competitive performance in estimating conditional average treatment effects across multiple benchmarks using synthetic and semi-synthetic data.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a novel paradigm for causal inference, showing promise to transform practices in various disciplines by leveraging PFNs trained with principled causal priors.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

*Morris Yau,Sharut Gupta,Valerie Engelmayer,Kazuki Irie,Stefanie Jegelka,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs), expanding upon state space models to achieve efficient sequential-parallel duality using general aggregation operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and unify the class of neural sequence models capable of efficient near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time sequential inference.

Method: The authors define Prefix-Scannable Models by extending state space models with custom aggregation operators, providing theoretical and experimental validation on small-scale tasks.

Result: PSMs are shown to retain transformer-like expressivity, achieve inference efficiency comparable to state space models, and demonstrate strong length generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed Prefix-Scannable Models effectively unify and advance state space and transformer architectures, paving the way for more efficient neural sequence models.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

### [281] [Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10922)
*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores demographic biases in large language models (LLMs) used in hiring processes, showing that biases persist in realistic contexts. It proposes mitigating these biases through an internal bias intervention method, achieving robust reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address and mitigate demographic biases in LLMs deployed in high-stakes hiring scenarios, especially since such biases have critical consequences on individuals' careers and lives.

Method: The study introduces an internal bias mitigation technique that identifies and neutralizes race and gender-sensitive attribute directions within model activations, using a method called affine concept editing.

Result: Introducing realistic contexts, such as company-specific details, results in significant demographic biases in LLMs. Using the proposed bias mitigation method, biases were reduced to levels typically under 1% and always below 2.5%, across both commercial and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the need for realistic evaluations when deploying LLMs in critical decision-making settings and advocate for internal bias mitigation strategies to ensure fair and equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

*Adam Zweiger,Jyothish Pari,Han Guo,Ekin Akyürek,Yoon Kim,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAL is a framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables self-adaptation through generating their own fine-tuning data and updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack the ability to dynamically adapt their weights to handle new tasks, knowledge, or examples.

Method: SEAL uses self-edits generated by the model to restructure data, specify hyperparameters, and implement updates via supervised finetuning. Reinforcement learning ensures these edits improve performance.

Result: SEAL achieved improvements in knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SEAL shows promise in creating LLMs capable of persistent self-directed adaptation without auxiliary modules.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

### [284] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD is a framework designed to improve unlearning in large language models while minimizing unintended information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unintended forgetting during the unlearning process in LLMs and to preserve utility while meeting regulatory and compliance needs.

Method: GUARD employs a proxy data attribution metric to guide unlearning and introduces adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights based on attribution scores.

Result: GUARD enhances retention in large language models, significantly reducing utility losses on retained data while maintaining effective unlearning.

Conclusion: GUARD demonstrates robust performance across benchmarks, retaining valuable information and offering a practical approach to compliant unlearning without compromising utility.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EG-CFG, a novel approach to code generation with neural models by integrating real-time execution feedback for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs for code generation lack the ability to utilize runtime execution feedback during inference, which human programmers rely upon.

Method: The EG-CFG method dynamically integrates execution signals by sampling program completions via beam search, testing them against test cases, and updating prompts line-by-line with the extracted feedback.

Result: EG-CFG significantly enhances code generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various coding tasks from basic to competitive programming.

Conclusion: Dynamic integration of execution signals with models like EG-CFG boosts coding task accuracy, introducing an innovative and effective real-time guidance approach.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes creating specialized Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) for web agents, addressing the challenges caused by agents interacting with human-designed interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents struggle with tasks due to the misalignment between LLM capabilities and human-designed interfaces, which undermines their potential for automating complex web interactions.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), outline six guiding design principles, and advocate for a shift towards interfaces optimized for agents rather than humans.

Result: AWIs are proposed as a way to improve the safety, efficiency, and standardization of agent interactions, mitigating the limitations of existing interface approaches.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for collaboration within the ML community to design AWIs and facilitate efficient and transparent web agent development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReGuidance, a wrapper method to improve the performance of pretrained diffusion models on hard inverse problems, ensuring better sample realism and reward by refining solutions through a reverse process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in current diffusion-based methods like DPS for solving inverse problems, especially in cases with weak rewards and low signal-to-noise ratio, where these methods often fail to produce realistic outputs.

Method: The proposed method, ReGuidance, works by inverting a candidate solution using the reverse unconditional probability flow ODE, then reinitializing DPS with the derived latent variable, enhancing both sample quality and measurement consistency.

Result: ReGuidance demonstrates superior performance in hard inverse problems such as large box in-painting and high-upscale super-resolution, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of sample quality and reward consistency.

Conclusion: ReGuidance effectively boosts the realism and performance of diffusion-based methods on hard tasks and provides the first theoretical guarantee for improving the performance of DPS.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

TL;DR: This paper theoretically studies in-context learning (ICL) for regression problems on geometric manifolds using transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand ICL's theoretical aspects, particularly for structured geometric data, which remains unexplored.

Method: The paper connects the attention mechanism in transformers to classical kernel methods and derives generalization error bounds relative to prompt length and training tasks.

Result: Transformers achieve the minimax regression rate for H"older functions on manifolds, scaling with intrinsic manifold dimensions rather than ambient dimensions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the role of geometry in ICL and provides theoretical tools for analyzing nonlinear models using transformers.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Farseer, a new scaling law for large language models (LLMs) that improves predictive accuracy across scales, surpassing existing models like Chinchilla's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the scalability gap in training LLMs, where small-scale experiments often fail to generalize to large-scale systems due to high training costs, hindering innovation.

Method: Farseer is developed by constructing a model loss surface $L(N, D)$, offering a more precise fit to empirical data. The methodology includes training about 1,000 LLMs with diverse configurations over 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours.

Result: Farseer significantly reduces extrapolation error by 433% compared to prior models like Chinchilla’s law, enabling accurate and generalizable predictions for large-scale experiments.

Conclusion: Farseer enables reliable extrapolation from small-scale experiments for large-scale LLM training, improves understanding of optimal compute allocation, and provides tools to optimize training strategies. All outcomes are open-sourced for the research community.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extend traditional neural architectures to neural operators for better applications in scientific problems involving infinite-dimensional function spaces, and provides practical guidance for implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks have been limited in scientific contexts due to their focus on finite-dimensional spaces. As scientific problems often involve infinite-dimensional function spaces—like those seen in PDEs—the paper aims to bridge this gap using neural operators.

Method: The authors present a set of principles to convert existing popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal adjustments, facilitating learning mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.

Result: They provide a practical recipe and guidance for translating traditional neural architectures into neural operators, showing how these transformed models can effectively learn solution operators for PDEs and other scientific problems.

Conclusion: Extending neural networks to neural operators could replicate the transformative impact of deep learning in broader fields, offering practitioners an accessible, practical pathway for implementation via this proposed framework.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

### [291] [Time To Impeach LLM-as-a-Judge: Programs are the Future of Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10403)
*Tzu-Heng Huang,Harit Vishwakarma,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PAJAMA, a program-based judge to evaluate LLMs, offering cost-effective, interpretable, and unbiased assessments outperforming LLM-based judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of using LLMs directly for assessing LLM outputs, such as high costs, biases, and inflexible pipelines, by proposing an alternative method.

Method: An LLM is used to synthesize local executable programs, which serve as reusable and interpretable judges for assessing outputs instead of direct LLM scoring.

Result: Program-based judges reduced judgment biases by 23.7%, improved consistency by 15.83%, and achieved better performance on challenging benchmarks at significantly lower costs.

Conclusion: PAJAMA represents a cost-efficient, adaptable, and reliable solution for evaluating LLMs, with measurable benefits in reducing biases and improving performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance LLM performance by enabling symbolic programming and interaction within a dynamic, persistent environment.

Method: Embedding Lisp expressions within LLM outputs and intercepting them through middleware for programmatic self-evolution within a live REPL environment.

Result: The integration allows stateful memory, tool creation, and improved interactive AI capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates a novel interaction model between LLMs and symbolic programming, providing guidelines for future AI system developments.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture for integrating large language models (LLMs)

intercepting them via a middleware layer, the system allows for stateful
external memory, reflective programming, and dynamic tool creation. We present
a design framework and architectural principles to guide future implementations
of interactive AI systems that integrate symbolic programming with neural
language generation.

### [293] [A Language-Agnostic Logical Relation for Message-Passing Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10026)
*Tesla Zhang,Sonya Simkin,Rui Li,Yue Yao,Stephanie Balzer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to verify protocol compliance in heterogeneous message-passing systems through a language-agnostic logical relation implemented in Coq.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of distributed and heterogeneous systems like cloud computing and IoT, ensuring protocol adherence between components becomes difficult due to the lack of shared implementation languages or type systems.

Method: Develop a framework using a labelled transition-based semantics to define a language-agnostic logical relation, with mechanization performed in Coq. It considers both per-instance verification and once-and-for-all verification.

Result: The paper introduced the first mechanized language-agnostic logical relation for protocol compliance and demonstrated it through case studies involving specific applications and type-system-wide adherence.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust methodology for certifying protocol adherence in heterogeneous systems, accommodating varying implementation languages and types.

Abstract: Today's computing landscape has been gradually shifting to applications
targeting distributed and *heterogeneous* systems, such as cloud computing and
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications are predominantly
*concurrent*, employ *message-passing*, and interface with *foreign objects*,
ranging from externally implemented code to actual physical devices such as
sensors. Verifying that the resulting systems adhere to the intended protocol
of interaction is challenging -- the usual assumption of a common
implementation language, let alone a type system, no longer applies, ruling out
any verification method based on them. This paper develops a framework for
certifying *protocol compliance* of heterogeneous message-passing systems. It
contributes the first mechanization of a *language-agnostic logical relation*,
asserting that its inhabitants comply with the protocol specified. This
definition relies entirely on a labelled transition-based semantics,
accommodating arbitrary inhabitants, typed and untyped alike, including foreign
objects. As a case study, the paper considers two scenarios: (1) *per-instance
verification* of a specific application or hardware device, and (2)
*once-and-for-all verification* of well-typed applications for a given type
system. The logical relation and both scenarios are mechanized in the Coq
theorem prover.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students struggle with creating handwritten derivation trees due to complexity, lack of feedback, and manual effort, necessitating tools to improve learning outcomes.

Method: Hazel Deriver integrates structured, interactive scaffolding layers using the Hazel live programming environment, aiding iterative exploration and real-time feedback.

Result: A preliminary user study indicates it reduces task difficulty, enhances conceptual understanding, and increases engagement.

Conclusion: Hazel Deriver successfully provides support for students' learning processes, but questions remain about optimizing the balance between system guidance and learner autonomy.

Abstract: Students in programming languages and formal logic courses often struggle
with constructing rule-based derivation trees due to the complexity of applying
inference rules, the lack of immediate feedback, and the manual effort required
for handwritten proofs. We present Hazel Deriver, a live, web-based editor
designed to scaffold derivation construction through multiple layers of
support. Built on the Hazel live programming environment, it provides a
structured, interactive experience that encourages iterative exploration and
real-time feedback. A preliminary user study with former students suggests that
Hazel Deriver reduces the perceived difficulty of derivation tasks while
improving conceptual understanding and engagement. We discuss the design of its
layered scaffolding features and raise questions about balancing system
guidance with learner autonomy.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $
{\lambda_{QC}}$, a typed choreographic programming language addressing limitations in existing choreographic languages by incorporating first-class process names, polymorphism, algebraic data types, and deadlock freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing choreographic languages lack essential features for modern concurrent systems, particularly dynamic role computation and communication.

Method: The authors propose $
{\lambda_{QC}}$, a language incorporating first-class process names, polymorphism, algebraic and recursive data types, and multiple-located values. Formalization and verification were conducted using Rocq.

Result: $
{\lambda_{QC}}$ demonstrates enhanced expressive power and guarantees standard properties like deadlock freedom.

Conclusion: $
{\lambda_{QC}}$ fills gaps in choreographic programming, advancing the paradigm with critical features and reliable guarantees for modern systems.

Abstract: Choreographic programming is a promising new paradigm for programming
concurrent systems where a developer writes a single centralized program that
compiles to individual programs for each node. Existing choreographic
languages, however, lack critical features integral to modern systems, like the
ability of one node to dynamically compute who should perform a computation and
send that decision to others. This work addresses this gap with $\lambda_{QC}$,
the first typed choreographic language with \emph{first class process names}
and polymorphism over both types and (sets of) locations. $\lambda_{QC}$ also
improves expressive power over previous work by supporting algebraic and
recursive data types as well as multiply-located values. We formalize and
mechanically verify our results in Rocq, including the standard choreographic
guarantee of deadlock freedom.

Motivation: To simplify the deployment of robotic systems for precision agriculture by enabling end-users without technical expertise to assign complex tasks using natural language.

Method: An end-to-end system using ChatGPT for natural language task assignment, encoding tasks in IEEE standards, and executing them on robots via ROS2 to bridge high-level mission plans and ROS libraries.

Result: Experiments showcased the system's ability to overcome LLM limitations in spatial reasoning and routing challenges, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world robotic missions.

Conclusion: The system successfully improves task assignment for autonomous robots in precision agriculture while addressing LLM challenges, signifying a step forward in user-friendly robotics integration.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

### [297] [Estimating the Joint Probability of Scenario Parameters with Gaussian Mixture Copula Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10098)
*Christian Reichenbächer,Philipp Rank,Jochen Hipp,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Gaussian Mixture Copula Models for modeling driving scenarios to improve safety validation of automated driving systems, demonstrating better performance compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the statistical modeling of driving scenarios to enable more accurate safety assessments for automated driving systems.

Method: It introduces Gaussian Mixture Copula Models, combining Gaussian Mixture Models' expressivity with copulas' flexibility to separately model marginal distributions and dependencies, and benchmarks their performance using real-world driving data.

Result: The evaluation across 18 million driving scenarios shows that Gaussian Mixture Copula Models outperform Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models offer a robust and accurate framework for scenario-based safety validation protocols in automated driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a natural language robotic mission planner, allowing non-technical users to control various robots for precision agriculture without coding using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of making robotic technologies accessible to non-technical users in precision agriculture, where current tools introduce complexity and steep learning curves.

Method: The proposed system utilizes large language models (LLMs) and predefined primitives to translate natural language commands into executable intermediate formats for different robotic platforms.

Result: The architecture proved general enough for various robots and capable of executing complex mission requests across robotic manipulation and computer vision experiments.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances the accessibility of robotic automation in precision agriculture, empowering non-technical users to effectively integrate these technologies.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

### [299] [A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172)
*Yicheng Duan,Kaiyu tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) using a frozen large vision-language model for efficient navigation without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational cost and adaptability issues in VLN using large vision-language models.

Method: A modular framework integrating a frozen vision-language model (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) with lightweight planning logic and techniques like prompt engineering, history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy.

Result: Evaluation on the Room-to-Room benchmark showed challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict settings, but indicated scalability potential.

Conclusion: While initial results highlight limitations, the framework shows promise for scalable navigation systems, with future work focusing on improved environmental priors and multimodal input integration.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

### [300] [A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Dynamic-, Trajectory- and Vision-based Virtual Fixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10239)
*Maximilian Mühlbauer,Freek Stulp,Sylvain Calinon,Alin Albu-Schäffer,João Silvério*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework for Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) to adaptively switch between manual, semi-automated, and autonomous operation modes based on uncertainty, validated experimentally across different robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving productivity while maintaining precision in robot-assisted tasks by enabling adaptive transitions between human and robotic control modes.

Method: Developed probabilistic Dynamical System-based VFs for coarse guidance, extended trajectory fixtures and visual servoing fixtures with geometry-awareness and optimized impedance for precise tasks.

Result: Experimental validation on various robots demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework across multiple operation modes and ease in programming fixtures.

Conclusion: The unified probabilistic VF framework enhances flexibility, productivity, and precision in robotic tasks, emphasizing the seamless integration of human-in-the-loop and automation processes.

Abstract: Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the
most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or
perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential,
for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task
phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for
probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures,
semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full
autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for
coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task
phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring
precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures
with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as
geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very
precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same
geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach
experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the
ease of programming fixtures.

### [301] [Innovative Adaptive Imaged Based Visual Servoing Control of 6 DoFs Industrial Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10240)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm using an innovative approach for Image-based Visual Servoing (IBVS) to tackle pose alignment, particularly when point features temporarily exit the visual field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard IBVS methods typically assume that 3D point features stay within the camera's field of view. However, this limits their use in practical scenarios where features can temporarily exit the view during motion control.

Method: The paper proposes a control methodology combining Youla Parameterization and an adaptive control loop. It features an estimation process for out-of-view points and adaptive feedback to stabilize diverse operations, alongside online linearization of nonlinear models.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the designed feedforward-feedback control algorithm achieves stable, precise pose alignment even under conditions where point features intermittently exit the field of view.

Conclusion: The proposed controller offers robustness and adaptability, validating its applicability for various industrial robotic systems through simulation scenarios.

Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used
in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment.
However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D
point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an
innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the
Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures
stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of
view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback
loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.
Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the
system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot
manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.
The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model
evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy
to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are
used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the
proposed controller.

### [302] [A Novel Feedforward Youla Parameterization Method for Avoiding Local Minima in Stereo Image Based Visual Servoing Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10252)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores stereo camera pose estimation using P3P formulation for robot tasks and proposes a novel servoing control strategy to avoid local minima, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overdetermined nature of the IBVS control system, where constraints exceed degrees of freedom, leading to local minima and instability in camera navigation.

Method: The method integrates a feedforward controller with feedback using Youla parameterization in a novel control strategy to ensure robust stereo camera positioning and servoing.

Result: Through simulations, the proposed approach demonstrated success in avoiding local minima and achieving accurate and efficient camera pose configuration.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed control strategy enhances stereo camera navigation by solving the local minima issue, ensuring robust and precise positioning.

Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's
pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In
this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the
Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and
their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a
stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system
becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera
must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are
imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the
camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration
during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for
accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a
feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,
ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the
desired pose accurately and efficiently.

*Alexandre Capone,Ryan Cosner,Aaaron Ames,Sandra Hirche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a safe control method for tasks with high model uncertainty, combining safety filters and on-the-fly data collection using exploration guided by control barrier functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High uncertainty in learned models can render safety filters invalid for control tasks, requiring novel approaches to address safety under these challenging conditions.

Method: The method combines control barrier functions with learned models to specify robust safety certificates. It uses Gaussian process bandit-type algorithms for exploration when safety constraints are infeasible, collecting data to ensure system safety without relying on backup controllers.

Result: The approach guarantees safety even with a zero-mean prior dynamics model and no need for a backup controller, a novel achievement in learning-based control.

Conclusion: The proposed method is the first to achieve provable safety in learning-based control under these conditions, advancing the field by eliminating the need for backup controllers and focusing on learned model safety.

Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty
are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to
address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify
robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model
uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,
meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety
filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe
backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly
using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier
function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures
safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control
barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes
toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with
exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting
that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup
controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based
control method that achieves this.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-scale Bayesian optimization approach for real-time control of complex systems like nuclear fusion, outperforming baselines in stability control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of controlling complex, dynamic systems where data is scarce, dynamics are intricate, and traditional machine learning tools fall short, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like nuclear fusion.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale Bayesian optimization framework that uses a high-frequency data-driven dynamics model and a low-frequency Gaussian process to refine predictions during experiments.

Result: The approach showed significant improvement in control performance, achieving 50% success in live fusion experiments, a 117% improvement compared to historical outcomes.

Conclusion: The multi-scale Bayesian optimization method effectively addresses the limitations of previous techniques in complex, high-risk applications, demonstrating potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world
systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as
the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to
failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's
duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and
Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a
comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale
Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven
dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian
process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining
the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach
by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant.
Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly
outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D
tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to
instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over
historical outcomes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving lane-topology prediction for autonomous navigation using structured road metadata and lane-width information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance autonomous navigation by improving the accuracy of lane-topology prediction, inspired by road design conventions and functionalities encoded in natural language.

Method: They augment the SMERF model with structured road metadata from OSM maps and road design manual information, integrating these with road centerline encodings.

Result: The enhanced model was tested on complex and geo-diverse intersections, showing enhanced detection and association of lanes and traffic elements across four topology-aware metrics.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates improved scalability and generalization, making it suitable for diverse road topologies and conditions.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores efficient robotic picking using multimodal data, focusing on real-world industrial scenarios to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need better strategies to pick diverse items from clutter in warehouses, meet latency constraints, and maintain high throughput.

Method: It combines RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation data using multimodal visual encoders, refined through pretraining and finetuning on real-world picking datasets.

Result: Experimental evaluations show improved predictions for robotic picks across diverse item setups, highlighting modality interplay and the utility of finetuning.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches are vital for efficient robotic picking, enabling simplified input during finetuning and inference without compromising performance.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient methods to validate the safety of ADAS and ADS, particularly at higher automation levels, due to the impracticality and high costs of traditional Field Operational Testing.

Method: The authors derive two models based on ISO 21448: a generic argumentation model and a base model for Automatic Emergency Braking systems, followed by a systematic assessment of Reduction Approaches (RAs) using four criteria.

Result: The evaluation reveals that existing Reduction Approaches have potential benefits but significant shortcomings, including missing links and validity threats, and none of them can fully replace FOT.

Conclusion: FOT remains essential for the safety validation of ADAS and ADS, but further research is needed to improve efficiency and address limitations in current safety validation methods.

Abstract: The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable
methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards
such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been
pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to
SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical
safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,
particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this
limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates
the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based
macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically
identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,
including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO
21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation
components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world
driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk
(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:
quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box
compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and
identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while
several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other
substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace
FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

*Nidhi Homey Parayil,Thierry Peynot,Chris Lehnert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robotic controller that uses position and tactile feedback to safely navigate through dense vegetation without damaging plants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for robotic systems capable of operating in cluttered, deformable environments like agricultural canopies where traditional approaches struggle.

Method: A reactive controller integrates end-effector position and real-time tactile feedback, balancing between avoiding obstacles and controlled pushing to reach occluded targets.

Result: In 35 trials across 3 plant setups, the controller consistently reached its target without breaking branches, outperforming a state-of-the-art model-free controller in robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: This research advances robotic interaction in complex environments and has potential applications in agricultural tasks like pruning and harvesting.

Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural
canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion
caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent
approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without
damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a
novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a
contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and
real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is
based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around
obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that
over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the
proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without
breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller
in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe,
adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments,
enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant
canopies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the challenges and strategies of adapting conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) to multi-party interactions in real-world settings and across different embodiments (robot vs. virtual agent).

Method: Two real-world studies conducted with 188 participants interacting in groups with two socially interactive agents, Furhat (robot) and MetaHuman (virtual agent), using a conversational AI system with hybrid retrieval and generative models in a museum setting.

Result: No significant impact of group-sensitive conversation design was found on user satisfaction, but the studies uncovered challenges with multi-party CAI adaptation and differences between robot and virtual agent interactions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for multimodal strategies in conversational AI for multi-party group settings, contributing to fields like Human-Agent Interaction and laying groundwork for future research in dialogue adaptation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in
two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both
SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped
with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid
retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild
setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs -
in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results
did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design
on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the
challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different
embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal
strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the
fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and
broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research
on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational efficiency in robotics by improving algorithms for inverse dynamics and kinematics using a spatial representation.

Method: Developed a second-order inverse dynamics and a fourth-order kinematics algorithm using spatial representation, demonstrated on a 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

Result: Efficiently computed joint torques/forces and their derivatives for robotic arms with compact and parametric Lie group formulations.

Conclusion: The proposed spatial formulation achieves computational efficiency while utilizing readily available vectorial quantities in a Lie group framework.

Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of
robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of
the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the
required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to
this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation
was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of
twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the
spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is
accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An
advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in
terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is
demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

*Yuhang Zhang,Haosheng Yu,Jiaping Xiao,Mir Feroskhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a modular framework enabling UAVs to navigate using language instructions without additional sensors. VLFly outperforms baselines in simulations and real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address two major challenges in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN): difficulty in generalization to unfamiliar environments and limiting reliance on fixed, discrete action spaces.

Method: VLFly is comprised of three modules: an instruction encoder that reformulates language into structured prompts, a goal retriever matching prompts to goal images using vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner creating trajectories for UAV control. It uses egocentric observations from an onboard monocular camera, eliminating the need for active sensors.

Result: VLFly achieves superior performance over baselines in diverse simulated environments and showcases robust navigation across indoor and outdoor real-world settings without fine-tuning, even with abstract instructions.

Conclusion: VLFly demonstrates the potential for efficient, real-world application of language-guided navigation for UAVs, offering improvements in goal understanding and adaptive navigation.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method combining visual and tactile sensors to improve in-hand pose estimation for robotic object manipulation, addressing challenges posed by visual occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of vision-based approaches in robotic object manipulation, especially due to visual occlusions, and improve pose estimation accuracy.

Method: The approach fuses visual data from an RGB-D camera with tactile data from vision-based sensors using a weighted sensor fusion module and an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.

Result: The method improved pose estimation accuracy with an average error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only methods by up to 20%, and demonstrated its practical use in a real-world insertion task.

Conclusion: Incorporating tactile information significantly enhances pose estimation accuracy, making the method suitable for precise robotic manipulation tasks, particularly in occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation,
but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches.
This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation,
combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position
and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge
of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D
camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on
the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and
sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types
and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use
an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point
clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating
tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy,
particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose
estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only
baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to
perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents the RAMA benchmark for testing robotic handling of natural language instructions, especially focusing on defective commands, and proposes the RationalVLA model, which outperforms existing approaches in success rate and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the unrealistic assumption in robotic manipulation that all natural language instructions align with the environment, as real-world instructions may often be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible.

Method: The authors introduce RAMA, a benchmark dataset with over 14,000 samples including defective instructions, and propose RationalVLA, a dual-system model integrating high-level vision-language reasoning with low-level manipulation, facilitated by learnable latent embeddings.

Result: RationalVLA achieves a 14.5% higher success rate and a 0.94 average task length on the RAMA benchmark compared to baselines, while also showing strong performance in real-world robotic trials.

Conclusion: The study shows that RationalVLA effectively addresses both the challenges of unseen executable instructions and the need to reject defective ones, thereby advancing the robustness and efficacy of robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to
understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing
language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are
perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and
generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,
irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional
MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen
executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we
construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective
instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,
safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational
Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic
arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level
manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This
design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible
commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that
RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher
success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive
performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate
its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is

### [315] [Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Autonomous Surface Vessels with Partial Orientation Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10850)
*Derek Benham,Easton Potokar,Joshua G. Mangelson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework that integrates partial orientation measurements for accurate state estimation in autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) in open ocean environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve state estimation accuracy, particularly vehicle pose, in ASVs operating in open oceans, where small deviations can significantly impact marine sensing applications like seafloor mapping.

Method: Introduced a novel InEKF framework that uses horizon-based roll and pitch observations from forward-facing monocular cameras and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements, instead of full orientation data, to estimate ASV states.

Result: The InEKF framework demonstrated efficacy and robustness in achieving accurate ASV state estimation using partial orientation data, especially when compared to traditional InEKF with full orientation and Multiplicative EKF (MEKF).

Conclusion: The proposed partial orientation framework offers a reliable alternative for ASV state estimation in seafaring conditions, providing enhanced robustness and accuracy in open ocean operations.

Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science,
offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state
estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor
mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences
when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate
partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on
relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily
observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to
estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides
yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these
measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating
such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF
implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly
relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This
paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based
roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state
estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full
orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for
accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven approach integrating dimension reduction, surrogate modeling, and data assimilation to model robot motion on granular terrain efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate robot navigation and exploration in unknown and complex terrains by reducing dependence on computationally expensive physics-based simulations.

Method: The proposed approach uses Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition for dimension reduction, Gaussian Process for surrogate modeling, and Reduced Order Particle Filter for data assimilation. It combines offline simulation data and sparse experimental data.

Result: The approach achieved orders of magnitude reduction in computational time compared to physics-based simulations, with comparable accuracy in prediction and improved performance for long-horizon tasks when experimental data was included.

Conclusion: This data-driven modeling approach offers an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional simulations for robotic terrain exploration, demonstrating scalability and general predictability.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines human trust in robot-assisted delivery systems by using a computational model to study trust dynamics and repair strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving human trust in autonomous systems is crucial for their effective collaboration in tasks like robot-assisted delivery.

Method: The researchers used data from human participants to model human behavior with an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM), analyzing trust dynamics and repair strategies, such as explanations, apologies, and denial.

Result: The study found that higher trust results in more autonomous robot deployment. Long explanations effectively repair trust after failures, while denial is best at preventing trust loss.

Conclusion: The developed model offers insights into human trust dynamics and links computational estimates to self-reported values, paving the way for real-time trust optimization in autonomous systems.

Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming
valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of
robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair
strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task,
humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually
control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long
explanations, apology and promise, and denial.
  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an
Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and
human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely
to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state
transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at
repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at
preventing trust loss.
  We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are
isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model
lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time
adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of in-hand object reconfiguration with high precision, leveraging fingertip micro-vibrations to modulate friction and improve manipulation capabilities.

Method: The method includes designing a vibration-based actuator to adjust friction coefficients, developing a sliding motion model, and creating a motion planner to control finger trajectories and vibrations for precise positioning.

Result: Experimental trials show that Vib2Move achieves final positioning errors below 6 mm, indicating reliable, high-precision manipulation across various planar objects.

Conclusion: Vib2Move demonstrates the effectiveness of fingertip micro-vibrations for precise object manipulation, presenting a promising solution for in-hand reconfiguration tasks at high precision.

Abstract: We introduce Vib2Move, a novel approach for in-hand object reconfiguration
that uses fingertip micro-vibrations and gravity to precisely reposition planar
objects. Our framework comprises three key innovations. First, we design a
vibration-based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective finger-object
friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second,
we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with
two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion
planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move
consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating

TL;DR: GenManip, a new simulation platform, is introduced to study robotic manipulation and generalization of policies across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address robust generalization challenges in robotic manipulation, especially in exploring adaptable instruction-following policies that simulation platforms have not adequately supported.

Method: The researchers developed GenManip, leveraging LLM-driven pipelines and human-in-the-loop corrections, to synthesize diverse tasks and systematically assess generalization performance across modular and end-to-end policies.

Result: From evaluations, modular manipulation systems incorporating foundation models demonstrated better generalization across varied scenarios compared to end-to-end policies, which benefitted from data scaling.

Conclusion: GenManip proves effective for studying and advancing policy generalization, suggesting the importance of combining modular systems with foundation models for adaptability in realistic settings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially
regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient
support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios.
Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation
models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in
fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic
tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It
features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to
synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To
systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of
200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy
types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for
perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained
through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits
end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize
more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to
facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic
conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.

TL;DR: The paper presents EyeRobot, a robotic system with an eyeball mechanism trained using reinforcement learning to develop gaze behavior necessary for real-world tasks, enhancing hand-eye coordination and manipulation over large workspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The project is driven by the principle that humans actively use gaze to assist in performing tasks, and aims to replicate such active gaze behavior in robotic systems for improved manipulation in complex environments.

Method: A mechanical eyeball capable of free rotation is paired with a gaze policy trained using reinforcement learning and a BC-RL loop. The steps include teleoperated data collection, simulation with 360-degree camera inputs, and joint training of hand and eye policies.

Result: EyeRobot demonstrates hand-eye coordination, improved object tracking, distraction ignoring, and stable gaze fixation for manipulation tasks spanning panoramic workspaces, evaluated on five real-world setups.

Conclusion: EyeRobot effectively replicates the active gaze mechanism, allowing robots to manipulate objects over large workspaces with enhanced coordination, suggesting its potential for advanced robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

TL;DR: TrioXpert is a framework for automated incident management in microservice systems, leveraging multimodal data for improved performance in anomaly detection, failure triage, and root cause localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for incident management rely on single-modal data and lack the capability to simultaneously address multiple tasks like anomaly detection, failure triage, and root cause localization while providing reasoning evidence.

Method: TrioXpert uses three independent data processing pipelines tailored to numerical and textual dimensions, incorporating a collaborative reasoning mechanism with large language models to address multiple tasks and ensure interpretability.

Result: TrioXpert achieved significant improvements across various tasks: 4.7%-57.7% improvement in anomaly detection, 2.1%-40.6% in failure triage, and 1.6%-163.1% in root cause localization.

Conclusion: TrioXpert effectively leverages multimodal data, addressing critical shortcomings in existing incident management approaches with enhanced task performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Automated incident management plays a pivotal role in large-scale
microservice systems. However, many existing methods rely solely on
single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to
simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection
(AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the
lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to
insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully
leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing
pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities,
comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems
from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative
reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle
multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong
interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular
microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that
TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%),
FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.

*Francesco Vinci,Gyunam Park,Wil van der Aalst,Massimiliano de Leoni*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a streaming process simulation discovery technique combining Incremental Process Discovery and Online Machine Learning to adapt to evolving business process dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Business Process Simulation (BPS) methods struggle with adaptability in dynamic environments as organizations continuously improve processes.

Method: The proposed method uses a streaming process simulation discovery that merges Incremental Process Discovery with Online Machine Learning to balance recent and historical data.

Result: Experiments on four event logs show improved stability in simulations and robustness to concept drift compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach ensures more adaptable, stable, and efficient simulations by emphasizing recent data while retaining historical process insights.

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) refers to techniques designed to replicate
the dynamic behavior of a business process. Many approaches have been proposed
to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs,
reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic
business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to
enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing
techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time
operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation
discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online
Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while
preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process
dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the
importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining
historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations
but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one
of the use cases.

### [323] [The Effects of GitHub Copilot on Computing Students' Programming Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Processes in Brownfield Programming Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10051)
*Md Istiak Hossain Shihab,Christopher Hundhausen,Ahsun Tariq,Summit Haque,Yunhan Qiao,Brian Mulanda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of GitHub Copilot on undergraduate students' performance and behavior in brownfield software development tasks, revealing significant efficiency improvements but also concerns about understanding Copilot's suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored influence of generative AI assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, on novice programmers in brownfield development scenarios involving unfamiliar legacy code bases.

Method: A controlled experiment involving 10 undergraduate computer science students completing similar brownfield programming tasks, both with and without GitHub Copilot, followed by a mixed-methods approach including performance analysis, behavioral observations, and exit interviews.

Result: Students using GitHub Copilot completed tasks 35% faster and made 50% more solution progress. They spent 11% less time coding manually and 12% less time conducting web searches, demonstrating altered engagement patterns in programming.

Conclusion: While GitHub Copilot enhances productivity in brownfield programming tasks, computing educators must address students' lack of understanding of AI-generated suggestions and adapt teaching methods accordingly.

Abstract: When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they
will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people
other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development
settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like
GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the
impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks
remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences
undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding
when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an
unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10
undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield
development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a
mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and
exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)
and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover,
our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time
manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p
< 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in
programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not
understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the
need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that
leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why
GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results

### [324] [Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056)
*Gabriel Orlanski,Nicholas Roberts,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in program ranking using large language models, highlighting the advantages and crucial role of outcome reward models (ORMs) within the generate-prune-then-rank method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the belief that comprehensive verifiers should always be prioritized over outcome reward models (ORMs) and systematically explore the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in program ranking.

Method: The authors propose and analyze a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking, ensuring scalability without compromising significantly on accuracy.

Result: The generate-prune-then-rank system is demonstrated to be 11.65x faster while only sacrificing 8.33% accuracy compared to using a full test suite for verification.

Conclusion: Outcome reward models can play a critical role in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of program ranking systems, even in the presence of comprehensive verifiers. The generate-prune-then-rank method effectively balances speed and accuracy.

Abstract: The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models
(LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier
in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier
(e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model
(ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs
involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the
tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in
scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a
comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent
when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less
accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a
system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full
test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it
works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings
enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.

*Andrei Paleyes,Radzim Sendyka,Diana Robinson,Christian Cabrera,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on evaluating how sensitive Large Language Models (LLMs) are to changes in input prompts for code generation, specifically based on user background differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess the impact of user prompt quality and background on the functionality and quality of code generated by LLMs, as understanding this sensitivity is critical for effective use.

Method: They propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation and a persona-based evaluation approach, both of which are systematic and independent of specific programming tasks or LLM models.

Result: Their methods reveal qualitative differences in output depending on user background and provide experimental evidence to validate the utility of their approaches.

Conclusion: The paper highlights how user-specific variations impact LLM code generation and introduces widely applicable evaluation tools to help understand this sensitivity, with open-source code shared for community use.

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HyperRes, a formal system using a hypergraph, enables versioned dependency resolution across diverse package management ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Package managers lack interoperability, leaving multilingual and multi-environment projects unable to express precise cross-language dependencies or manage unversioned external dependencies.

Method: Introduces HyperRes, employing a hypergraph structure for describing versioned dependency resolution, and translates metadata from existing package managers into this system.

Result: Demonstrated that dependency resolution is feasible across ecosystems, bridging currently distinct package managers without requiring users to change tools.

Conclusion: HyperRes facilitates cross-ecosystem compatibility, allowing specialized dependency resolution while preserving users' package manager preferences.

Abstract: Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating
system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between
these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise
dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware
dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a
formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph
that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency
constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package
managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution
can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require
users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for
the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be
precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using containerization and open-source Virtual Platform technologies to facilitate hardware/software co-development by addressing testing challenges and enabling pre-silicon software execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of hardware/software systems in safety-critical domains like automotive, combined with limited early access to hardware for testing and software development, necessitates innovative approaches to streamline the process.

Method: The researchers utilized containerization to encapsulate Virtual Platforms (VPs), enabling cloud deployment, parallelized testing, and reduced environment dependencies. Additionally, open-source VP technologies, such as QEMU and VCML, eliminated the need for seat licenses.

Result: The approach was demonstrated with an AI accelerator Virtual Platform case study to highlight its benefits in accelerating HW/SW co-development.

Conclusion: Containerized Virtual Platforms, combined with open-source technologies, offer a practical solution to overcome HW/SW co-development challenges, enabling faster and more efficient pre-silicon testing in cloud environments.

Abstract: The ever-increasing complexity of HW/SW systems presents a persistent
challenge, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive, where
extensive testing is imperative. However, the availability of hardware often
lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this,
Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a
pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified
target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging
containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies
and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as
open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat
licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a
robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW
systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.

### [329] [Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322)
*Xueying Du,Kai Yu,Chong Wang,Yi Zou,Wentai Deng,Zuoyu Ou,Xin Peng,Lingming Zhang,Yiling Lou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses high false positive rates in static bug analyzers by introducing LLM4PFA, a framework leveraging LLMs for advanced path feasibility analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static bug analyzers struggle with verifying path feasibility in complex scenarios, leading to high false positives, especially in large codebases.

Method: Proposes an iterative path feasibility analysis framework (LLM4PFA) using LLM agents for targeted constraint reasoning and context-aware analysis.

Result: LLM4PFA reduces 72%-96% of false positives in static bug detection, outperforming baselines by 41.1%-105.7%, and misses only 3 real bugs out of 45 true positives.

Conclusion: LLM4PFA demonstrates significant improvements over current methods, enhancing precision in bug detection for large-scale codebases.

Abstract: Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality.
However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer
from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited
capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple
conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based
approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited
due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in
large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path
feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted
constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning,
LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis
for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show
that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during
static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% -
105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true
positives.

TL;DR: This paper integrates Large Language Models like GPT-4 into a static analysis framework for automated code issue detection and revision, combining prompt engineering, RAG, and custom validation steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve software development workflows by reducing issues like bugs and vulnerabilities while automating code revisions to save time and resources.

Method: The study integrates LLMs into a static code analysis framework, employs iterative prompt engineering, uses RAG for enhanced output precision, and implements a custom 'Code Comparison App' to address LLM hallucinations.

Result: The system reported a significant reduction in code issues within the target codebase, demonstrating effective integration of LLMs and static analysis frameworks.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG enhances code quality, streamlines workflows, and reduces time and resource costs effectively.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

Motivation: To address the absence of standardized automated evaluation tools for geospatial code generation, which is crucial for integrating AI with geo-scientific analysis.

Method: The framework is built on Google Earth Engine's Python API and features a benchmark dataset with 6,365 test cases across various data types and task categories. It uses multi-dimensional metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and error patterns for evaluation.

Result: AutoGEEval++ evaluates 24 state-of-the-art language models and reveals performance differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, proving its practical utility and scalability.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first standardized evaluation protocol and benchmark for geospatial LLM code generation, providing a basis for comparison and methodological insights for domain-specific code evaluation.

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is becoming a key frontier in integrating
artificial intelligence with geo-scientific analysis, yet standardised
automated evaluation tools for this task remain absent. This study presents
AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first
automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating

modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API,
AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test
cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme
tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an
end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to
execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional
metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error
types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary

*Fan Wu,Cuiyun Gao,Shuqing Li,Xin-Cheng Wen,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LayoutCoder is a multimodal framework for converting webpage images into accurate UI code, achieving better performance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UI2Code is a time-intensive and critical task in website development. Existing methods rely on extensive labeled data and fail to generalize, which motivates exploring solutions using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Method: LayoutCoder introduces three modules: Element Relation Construction (to capture UI layouts), UI Layout Parsing (to construct layout trees), and Layout-Guided Code Fusion (to generate accurate code). A benchmark dataset, Snap2Code, is also developed for evaluation.

Result: LayoutCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods by improving BLEU score by 10.14% and CLIP score by 3.95%, as seen in evaluations using datasets like Snap2Code and Design2Code.

Conclusion: MLLM-based LayoutCoder demonstrates significant advancements in automating accurate and layout-preserving UI code generation, addressing challenges in UI layout comprehension and generalization.

Abstract: Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website
development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of
UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the
development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task;
however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and
struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating
the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and
generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we
propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from
real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element
Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and
grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims
at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation
process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the
accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark
dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into
seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the
popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior
performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with
the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and
3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper develops a rule-based framework to classify quantum software bugs by type, category, severity, and quality impact, achieving up to 85.21% accuracy with notable limitations in severity classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for accurate bug classification in quantum software to enhance reliability and improve software quality.

Method: The framework uses keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored for quantum computing, tested against manually classified data from 12,910 issues in 36 Qiskit repositories.

Result: The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy and substantial to almost perfect agreement for most classifications except severity. Analysis revealed classical bugs dominate (67.2%) over quantum-specific ones (27.3%).

Conclusion: The framework effectively classifies bugs with high accuracy, though severity classification needs improvement. Findings provide insights into quantum software defects and their impact on quality attributes.

Abstract: Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software
quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying
issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and
impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug
types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to
quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a
stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36
Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth
using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to
85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393
(quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's
Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696),
category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug
type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162),
suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical
bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug
categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects,
while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted
quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were
critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over
half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and
hardware-related issues.

*Xiao Yu,Haoxuan Chen,Feifei Niu,Xing Hu,Jacky Wai Keung,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes 308 fixed bugs in three distributed frameworks for LLMs and identifies challenges and potential solutions for effective debugging and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of distributed training and inference frameworks for LLMs introduces complex software bugs, which can degrade performance and waste resources, making it crucial to understand bug characteristics for quality assurance and effective debugging.

Method: A large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs was conducted across three distributed training/inference frameworks (DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI) to study bug symptoms, root causes, fixing efforts, and strategies.

Result: 48% of bug fixes required simple changes (<=10 LOC), highlighting potential for automation. Unique challenges include the distributed nature of frameworks, high reproduction costs, and complex root causes.

Conclusion: By understanding bug characteristics and strategies for fixing them, the paper provides insights to improve framework reliability and identifies potential for LLM-based tools to automate debugging and repair efforts.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed
training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for
scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However,
the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,
which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result
in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is
fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective
debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale
empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed
training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We
examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and
common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of
these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy
error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs
remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and
root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component
interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal
code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic
optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility
handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we
offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed
training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also
identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging
and repair.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current LLM-based software repair approaches, which fail to leverage insights from past repairs and are restricted by rigid prompting strategies.

Method: ExpeRepair leverages dual memory systems inspired by human cognition, combining episodic memory for repair demonstrations and semantic memory for abstract insights, with dynamic prompt composition to enhance the repair process.

Result: Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark show ExpeRepair achieving a pass@1 score of 49.3%, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ExpeRepair represents a significant advancement in software repair, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating experience-driven insights and dynamic prompts for addressing diverse repair scenarios.

Abstract: Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at
the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for
repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable
limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to
incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on
static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to
generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual
memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work
synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose
ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical
repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair
organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an
episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic
memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair
activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from
episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory.
It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,
synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with
context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.

*Surya Jasper,Minh Luu,Evan Pan,Aakash Tyagi,Michael Quinn,Jiang Hu,David Kebo Houngninou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BugGen is an autonomous system using Large Language Models to generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in hardware verification, achieving high accuracy and significantly accelerating the debugging process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of hardware challenges verification processes, necessitating improved debugging tools. Existing methods fail to produce scalable and diverse bug datasets, slowing ML-assisted debugging.

Method: BugGen employs a multi-agent pipeline with Large Language Models for autonomous bug generation. It uses module partitioning, target selection, iterative refinement, rollback mechanisms, and a closed-loop architecture to ensure correctness and detectability.

Result: BugGen generated 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy, identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan, and achieved a throughput over 5 times faster than manual methods. It outperformed Certitude in accuracy and functional relevance.

Conclusion: BugGen provides a scalable and efficient solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, improving verification efficiency and enhancing ML-based debugging through realistic bug scenarios.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

### [337] [AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525)
*Junhang Cheng,Fang Liu,Chengru Wu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AdaptiveLLM introduces a task difficulty-based selection mechanism to dynamically optimize code generation using LLMs, achieving competitive efficiency and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in balancing performance and inference costs of LLMs in coding tasks, as existing methods fail to incorporate cost considerations or rely heavily on human annotations of task difficulty.

Method: AdaptiveLLM estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought reasoning lengths, clusters them with k-means into levels, and fine-tunes CodeBERT for difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier selects the optimal model.

Result: AdaptiveLLM improves pass@1 score by 7.86%, reduces resource consumption by 88.9% compared to ComplexityNet, and achieves about 15% higher accuracy over using a single model without increasing costs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances cost-efficiency and performance. Its automated task difficulty assessment using Chain-of-Thought lengths proves more reliable than human evaluation, enhancing code generation optimization through LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code
generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance
and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the
optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a
promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and
performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive
and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on
human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in
real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task
difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that
dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically
assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using
Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into
three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed
difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best
model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental
results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score
while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method
ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an
approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of
cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides
more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package
is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.

### [338] [Not One to Rule Them All: Mining Meaningful Code Review Orders From GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10654)
*Abir Bouraffa,Carolin Brandt,Andy Zaidmann,Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates developers' navigation patterns during code review in GitHub pull requests and finds that reviewers often follow non-alphabetical and meaningful file-reviewing orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and support for code reviews by understanding how developers navigate and comment on changes in GitHub pull requests.

Method: The authors mined and analyzed code review comments from 23,241 pull requests across 100 popular Java and Python repositories to identify reviewers' navigation orders.

Result: Reviewers navigated in non-alphabetical order in 44.6% of pull requests. Patterns like largest-diff-first (20.6%), title-description similarity (17.6%), and test-first (29%) were identified. Non-alphabetical orders led to more reviewed files but slightly fewer approvals.

Conclusion: Code review navigation often deviates from default alphabetical order, suggesting a need for additional reviewer support, especially for larger pull requests requiring complex strategies.

Abstract: Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss
proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly
presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the
reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different
navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in
pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100
popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which
the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for
44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order.
Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful
orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were
commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and
description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both
production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that
the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly
higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly
fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for
additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests,
where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than
following a single predefined order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automatically generating formal specifications and maintaining traceability from requirements to system implementation and verification.

Method: The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), ontologies, similar system artefact reuse, large language models, and artificial intelligence techniques.

Result: The project outlines a framework for improving automatic formalization and traceability of requirements in software systems.

Conclusion: VERIFAI aims to enhance the process of translating natural language requirements into formal and traceable specifications through the integration of modern computational techniques.

Abstract: This paper is a brief introduction to our recently initiated project named
VERIFAI: Traceability and verification of natural language requirements. The

specifications through providing support for the automatic generation of the
formal specifications and the traceability of the requirements from the initial
software design stage through the systems implementation and verification.
Approaches explored in this project include Natural Language Processing, use of
ontologies to describe the software system domain, reuse of existing software
artefacts from similar systems (i.e. through similarity based reuse) and large
language models to identify and declare the specifications as well as use of
artificial intelligence to guide the process.

*Joran Leest,Claudia Raibulet,Patricia Lago,Ilias Gerostathopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of contextual information for better ML monitoring practices, introducing a framework and reusable patterns to address the gap in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ML monitoring tools currently focus on detecting statistical anomalies, they fall short in addressing contextual misalignment, which is a common cause of failure in production ML systems.

Method: The study conducted a systematic review of 94 research papers across multiple disciplines, creating a conceptual model called the Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework and identifying 20 reusable patterns.

Result: The analysis yielded the C-SAR framework and 20 patterns that link specific contexts to monitoring activities, facilitating a more systematic approach to ML monitoring.

Conclusion: The study shifts ML monitoring from mere anomaly detection to a structured approach using contextual understanding, paving the way for more reliable and systematic practices.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models in production do not fail due to statistical
anomalies in their input data; they fail due to contextual misalignment -- when
their environment deviates from training assumptions, leading to unreliable
predictions. Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to
move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and
systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research
in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation,
out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use
contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves
interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a
systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual
information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across
data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the
Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model
that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially
reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations,
and map them to the monitoring activities they support. This study provides a
new perspective on ML monitoring: from interpreting "tea leaves" of
observational statistics into constructing and managing "system maps" that
enable systematic and reliable ML monitoring practices.

*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps using a dataset of 292 apps and 894K reviews, developing an analysis pipeline to extract detailed sentiments and clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how users perceive, evaluate, and critique AI features in mobile apps, a largely unexplored area due to the overwhelming volume of data.

Method: The authors create a multi-stage pipeline for analyzing user feedback, using a human-labeled benchmark and evaluating LLMs for review classification, sentiment extraction, and clustering.

Result: The analysis extracted over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 33 user topics, identifying consistent themes in positive (productivity, reliability) and negative (technical failures, pricing) feedback.

Conclusion: Their approach provides a refined representation of user experiences with AI-powered apps, overcoming limitations of traditional sentiment analysis and highlighting category-specific insights.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of applying LLMs to non-code tasks in software engineering.

Method: They introduce a benchmark (SELU) with diverse tasks and metrics, fine-tune 22 open-source models, prompt 2 proprietary ones, and compare performance using statistical tests.

Result: Decoder-only models show strong performance with consistent results despite modest improvement from code-centric pre-training.

Conclusion: SELU offers insights for selecting LLMs for non-code SE tasks and suggests future directions for model design adaptations and benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code
Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first
comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language
Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from
identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating
the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification,
regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue
tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs,
prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is
measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and
compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that
moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting
high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via
code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights
guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for
expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.

*Quinn Thibeault,Giulia Pedrielli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiCoSim, a Python-based framework for flexible and automated co-simulation of diverse CPS components to address limitations in existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in co-simulation of CPS due to rigid and inflexible simulation tools, which lack automation and modularity, hindering reuse, portability, and comparative evaluation.

Method: The authors developed MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework allowing programmatic definition, composition, and configuration of simulation components. It supports distributed co-simulation and seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components.

Result: MultiCoSim's flexibility and utility were demonstrated via case studies, including custom automaton-based controllers and integration with off-the-shelf platforms like PX4 for aerial robotics.

Conclusion: MultiCoSim streamlines CPS simulation pipelines, enabling flexible, modular, and automated simulation for research and development purposes.

Abstract: Simulation is a foundational tool for the analysis and testing of
cyber-physical systems (CPS), underpinning activities such as algorithm
development, runtime monitoring, and system verification. As CPS grow in
complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled
settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of
simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,
and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of
heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances
in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in
diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the
development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for
automated and comparative evaluation.
  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation
support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are
configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation
components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly
compose systems or integrate components across platforms.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based
simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure
simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed,
component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and
reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim
through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom
automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf
platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight
MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and
development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale datasets for GitHub issue resolution, addressing challenges like evaluation setup and validation. It shows cost-effective and accurate performance using multi-agent systems and standardized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the labor-intensive challenges of creating large-scale benchmarks for training and evaluating software engineering tasks in LLMs, specifically in GitHub issue resolution.

Method: The authors developed SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline that integrates a multi-agent system (SWE-Builder), a standardized exit-code-based grading approach, and an automated fail2pass validation process.

Result: SWE-Factory successfully constructed valid task instances, achieving $0.045 per instance with GPT-4.1-mini and $0.024 per instance with Gemini-2.5-flash. The grading method showed 100% accuracy, and the validation process achieved a precision of 0.92 and recall of 1.00.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory effectively addresses the challenges of creating GitHub issue resolution datasets, offering a cost-efficient and highly accurate solution that facilitates the development of LLMs in software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

*Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi,Amir Najafi,Abolfazl Motahari,Babak H. khalaj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy and noiseless data, while proposing novel techniques for distribution recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine sample complexity bounds and address an open question about estimating simplices from noisy and noiseless data in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The authors use sample compression techniques and introduce a Fourier-based method to analyze sample complexity in simplex learning under different noise conditions.

Result: An algorithm is crafted that guarantees good approximation of simplices, introducing bounds for both noisy and noiseless cases, and the findings extend prior work with new theoretical insights.

Conclusion: The study resolves a crucial open problem by aligning noisy-case complexity with noiseless scenarios when signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a threshold, and introduces potential advancements in distribution recovery methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework, 3MSBM, for learning trajectories in complex systems using multi-marginal Schrödinger bridges, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies and the scalability of computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory inference in sparse snapshots often lack the ability to effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies, leading to coherence issues in inferred trajectories.

Method: The proposed method, 3MSBM, lifts dynamics into phase space and introduces multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control combined with a variational objective to learn smooth measure-valued splines and transport maps.

Result: 3MSBM showed superior performance in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies compared to existing methods, validated through extensive experiments in various real-world applications.

Conclusion: The framework can significantly improve trajectory inference for sparse snapshots, paving the way for scalable matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings across different domains.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the continuum from adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, utilizing the framework of distributionally constrained adversaries to generalize and refine learnability criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between adversarial and stochastic settings in online learning, providing a more flexible framework to understand learnability under constrained distributional classes.

Method: The study characterizes distribution classes that enable learning against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, analyzing interactions between function classes and adversarial constraints.

Result: It generalizes learnability for smoothed settings and shows that learners, including linear classifiers, can achieve learning without prior knowledge of distribution classes.

Conclusion: The findings advance the theoretical understanding of learnability along the continuum from stochastic to adversarial, offering a broader perspective and tools for practical applications in online learning.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

*Florian Handke,Félix Koulischer,Gabriel Raya,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores when semantic decisions are made during image generation in diffusion processes using an information-theoretic method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the timing and mechanisms of semantic and structural emergence in image generation via diffusion.

Method: Uses a Bayesian classifier to measure conditional entropy and its time derivative to identify semantic information transfer intervals.

Result: Finds the highest semantic information transfer occurs in intermediate diffusion stages, with timing varying across classes.

Conclusion: Semantic decisions in diffusion processes are class-dependent and occur during specific intermediate times.

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

### [349] [Box-Constrained Softmax Function and Its Application for Post-Hoc Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10572)
*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Box-Constrained Softmax" (BCSoftmax), a function designed to enforce explicit lower and upper bounds on output probabilities, addressing limitations of conventional softmax in specific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to impose hard constraints like bounding probabilities in modern machine learning models to ensure reliability and trustworthiness in outputs.

Method: Introduces BCSoftmax, derived from a box-constrained optimization problem, and develops an efficient algorithm to compute it. Further, proposes two calibration methods to adjust confidence in predictive models post-training.

Result: Experimental results on TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets show improved calibration metrics using the BCSoftmax-based methods.

Conclusion: BCSoftmax enhances the reliability of machine learning models by mitigating under- and overconfidence issues and effectively enforces constraints for trustworthy outputs.

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

### [350] [Logarithmic Smoothing for Adaptive PAC-Bayesian Off-Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10664)
*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores adaptive off-policy learning, a scenario where policies are iteratively refined, leveraging PAC-Bayesian theory to improve data collection and convergence beyond static settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static off-policy learning by enabling iterative policy improvement and adaptive data collection.

Method: Extending PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) to adaptive settings using online PAC-Bayesian tools, and adjusting the LS estimator to handle multiple deployment rounds.

Result: The proposed method outperforms leading static off-policy approaches during intermediate policy deployments while matching their baseline performance in static setups.

Conclusion: Adaptive off-policy learning using PAC-Bayesian methods enables superior policy learning by integrating iterative deployments, showcasing its empirical efficacy in various scenarios.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

### [351] [Practical Improvements of A/B Testing with Off-Policy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10677)
*Sakhi Otmane,Gilotte Alexandre,Rohde David*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for A/B testing that reduces variance in estimations compared to the widely used difference-in-means estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B testing often relies on a difference-in-means estimator to quantify improvements, but this approach, while unbiased, could be improved for better accuracy and variance reduction.

Method: The authors propose a family of unbiased off-policy estimators, identifying one within this family that achieves the lowest variance and can be applied simply.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces variance in A/B testing when the systems being compared are similar, validated through both theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Conclusion: The newly introduced estimator is effective, practical, and offers substantial improvements over the standard difference-in-means estimator in applicable scenarios.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

### [352] [Demystifying Spectral Feature Learning for Instrumental Variable Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10899)
*Dimitri Meunier,Antoine Moulin,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the use of spectral features in nonparametric instrumental variable regression for estimating causal effects while considering hidden confounders. It introduces a taxonomy to classify scenarios—'good,' 'bad,' and 'ugly'—based on spectral alignment and eigenvalue characteristics, offering insights into the approach's strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve understanding and address performance issues with causal effect estimation methods in the presence of hidden confounders, particularly using spectral features in nonparametric instrumental variable regression.

Method: The paper derives a generalization error bound for a spectral-feature-based two-stage least squares estimator. It develops a performance taxonomy based on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay to analyze the method's reliability in different scenarios.

Result: The analysis identifies three scenarios: 'good' (strong spectral alignment and slow eigenvalue decay result in optimal performance), 'bad' (strong spectral alignment but rapid eigenvalue decay requires more samples), and 'ugly' (weak spectral alignment causes method failure). Synthetic experiments confirm these results.

Conclusion: The study provides a nuanced understanding of when and why the spectral feature approach in IV regression works or fails, demonstrating the importance of spectral alignment and eigenvalue behavior in determining performance.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A method is proposed to combine expert labels with AI model predictions for cost-effective labeled dataset creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current labeled dataset generation methods are expensive due to reliance on extensive human annotation or costly experiments.

Method: The approach supplements expert labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to create approximately correct labels with a controlled error rate.

Result: The methodology was successfully demonstrated across tasks like text annotation, image labeling, and protein folding analysis.

Conclusion: Using pre-trained AI models can rigorously and efficiently curate datasets while reducing costs.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

### [354] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance (CFG), deriving an explicit solution for guided reverse dynamics and analyzing the effects of guidance on sampling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and precisely characterize how guidance in diffusion models influences sampling dynamics, particularly its impact on the output distribution and sampling trajectory.

Method: A theoretical analysis assuming no score or discretization error, deriving solutions for guided reverse dynamics, and conducting experiments to study geometric and convergent effects.

Result: Guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppressing shared regions, inducing distinct covariance structures. Behavior differs in 1D and 2D, and large guidance strength leads to double-exponential decay in total variation.

Conclusion: Classifier-free guidance has profound influence not only on shaping output distributions but also on controlling sampling trajectory dynamics, with both theoretical and experimental backing.

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper addresses high computational challenges in uncertainty quantification of kinetic equations by using multiscale control variates and physics-based neural networks to reduce variance and improve sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the slow convergence and high variance in traditional Monte Carlo methods, which are exacerbated in high-dimensional stochastic kinetic equations.

Method: They introduce a multiscale control variate approach combined with surrogate models based on Structure and Asymptotic Preserving Neural Networks (SAPNNs), trained with low-fidelity solutions and enriched high-fidelity samples.

Result: Numerical results show that their proposed methodology achieves better accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC methods, while preserving key physical properties and attaining significant variance reduction.

Conclusion: The method allows efficient large-scale predictions for kinetic equations with stochastic parameters, with validation across multiple regimes, demonstrating practicality and improved performance.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

TL;DR: This paper presents DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance where audiences collectively influence a dancer-robot duet via real-time voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay between collective agency, perceived influence, and actual power within participatory entertainment settings.

Method: Audience members voted during live dance performances to direct the behavior of a wearable robot, shaping choreography through collective input.

Result: Surveys showed audiences felt they influenced the performance, but voting data revealed consistent trends that limited actual change.

Conclusion: DANCE^2 illustrates the nuanced dynamics between felt agency, real agency, and power, paralleling behaviors in algorithmic systems.

Abstract: We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience
members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on
the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments
during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the
choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through
real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that
participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting
data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns.
This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what
actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the
experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction
design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship,
offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where
agency is felt, but not exercised.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how Artificial Intelligence can effectively enhance human creativity through various interactions and roles.

Method: The paper adopts the distributed creativity perspective and categorizes modes of AI contribution into Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis based on AI's autonomy and agency. It examines creative influence across problem-solving levels.

Result: Three modes of AI-enhanced creativity (Support, Synergy, Symbiosis) are defined, and their influence on different levels of creativity is discussed along with theoretical, ethical, and design considerations.

Conclusion: This framework offers insights into designing AI systems that enhance creativity while considering ethical and theoretical factors.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how generative AI technologies can enhance social connectedness and interactions, addressing the associated benefits and challenges.

Method: The method involved a scoping review of 30 studies since 2020, analyzing generative AI applications in various domains and examining their design and evaluation methodologies.

Result: Key application areas include storytelling, socio-emotional training, collaborative learning, and general conversation. The study also identifies trends and issues like cultural bias and accessibility.

Conclusion: The study concludes that generative AI has great potential for improving social interactions but stresses the need for equitable design and inclusive evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Result: The integrated domain-based CP and STP CNN approach enables effective image and third-order signal identifications without generating junk information caused by padding.

Conclusion: This novel method combining domain-based CP with STP enhances CNNs by eliminating padding-related issues and is effective for solving tasks like image and signal identification.

*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents an algorithm that optimizes the location of an eye-to-hand camera in manufacturing environments to minimize image noise and improve observation precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual servoing applications in manufacturing focus on control architectures with limited attention to the camera's location's effects on observation quality.

Method: The proposed algorithm adapts search policies to learn the environment and identify optimal or suboptimal camera positions within energy constraints, leveraging an image averaging technique.

Result: Simulations demonstrated improved observation precision and reduction in image noise, achieved using the energy-efficient movement of the camera.

Conclusion: The algorithm improves the accuracy of eye-to-hand visual servoing systems by optimizing camera placement without compromising image quality or consuming excessive energy.

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel deep learning method, DUN-SRE, for dynamic MRI reconstruction by exploiting spatiotemporal rotation symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction models fail to incorporate temporal symmetry, a crucial structural prior for dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Method: The DUN-SRE combines spatiotemporal equivariant convolutional architecture with a unified deep unrolling framework for enforced symmetry constraints.

Result: Experiments show the DUN-SRE significantly improves reconstruction quality, particularly preserving rotation-symmetric structures in Cardiac CINE MRI datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers state-of-the-art performance and strong generalizability, advancing dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HFF-Net, focusing on improving segmentation of brain tumors in post-contrast MRI images via a frequency-domain approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods for brain tumors show poor performance in highlighting contrast-enhancing regions due to insufficient modeling of MRI-specific features like textures and directional variations.

Method: The authors propose the HFF-Net architecture that utilizes a Frequency Domain Decomposition module, an Adaptive Laplacian Convolution module, and Frequency Domain Cross-Attention to better characterize and fuse relevant tumor features.

Result: Evaluation on four public datasets demonstrates an average improvement of 7.33% in segmentation accuracy for contrast-enhancing tumor regions and 4.48% improvement overall, highlighting significant advancements in tumor boundary sensitivity and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HFF-Net effectively enhances segmentation accuracy for difficult brain tumor regions while remaining computationally efficient and clinically adaptable, representing a noteworthy step forward in MRI analysis.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCELLA, a medical imaging LDM approach that enhances image synthesis using limited data. It improves performance and accessibility compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical imaging machine learning, such as data scarcity and inefficient training strategies for latent diffusion models.

Method: Propose CCELLA, a dual conditioning system combining large language model-induced text features and pathology classification, with a joint loss function and data-efficient LDM training framework.

Result: Achieved a 3D FID score of 0.025, outperforming an existing model, and improved prostate cancer classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% using synthetic images.

Conclusion: CCELLA facilitates high-quality medical image synthesis in data-limited settings, boosting classifier performance and providing an effective alternative to real image training.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from challenges in pathology detection using supervised machine learning, especially for rare diseases where diseased data is not readily available.

Method: A conditional diffusion model is used with weak supervision, including synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images via fluid-driven anomaly randomization for realistic augmentation.

Result: The model consistently outperforms variational autoencoders, conditional and unconditional latent diffusion models, and often surpasses supervised inpainting methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates strong capability in detecting pathology and reconstructing healthy images, addressing existing limitations of unsupervised and supervised methods.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

*Cheng Wang,Siqi Chen,Donghua Mi,Yang Chen,Yudong Zhang,Yinsheng Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWDL-Net, a semi-supervised learning framework for segmenting intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), combining Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling for enhanced precision, and demonstrates its high performance even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty and cost of manually annotating data for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) segmentation in medical imaging, by using semi-supervised learning to reduce dependency on labeled data while achieving accurate segmentation.

Method: The approach involves the creation of SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework combining Laplacian pyramid techniques for edge sharpening and deep convolutional upsampling for detail mapping. These are integrated via a difference learning mechanism to achieve precise segmentation of details and boundaries.

Result: SWDL-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a 271-case ICH dataset and the Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset, even in scenarios with very limited labeled data (2%-5%).

Conclusion: SWDL-Net demonstrates that combining complementary techniques in SSL frameworks can produce superior segmentation outcomes, proving effective even with minimal annotated data, potentially reducing the labeling burden in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

*Xi Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Peng Cao,Jinzhu Yang,Osmar R. Zaiane*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Medical image segmentation models struggle with domain shifts, and the proposed ConStyX method enhances their generalizability through content and style augmentation while mitigating over-augmentation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance degradation of medical image segmentation models caused by domain shifts and improve their generalizability.

Method: Introduced a domain randomization-based method called ConStyX, which augments both content and style of training data and mitigates the negative effects of over-augmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments showed superior generalization performance of ConStyX across multiple domains.

Conclusion: ConStyX effectively enhances medical image segmentation models' resilience to domain shifts through innovative content and style augmentation.

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-URWKV, a medical image segmentation framework that leverages pre-trained RWKV models for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcomings in existing medical image segmentation approaches, including CNNs, Transformers, and hybrid models, led to exploring the emerging RWKV model for its strong long-range modeling capabilities.

Method: Med-URWKV integrates the pure RWKV mechanism with a U-Net framework and pre-trained VRWKV encoder from ImageNet-based datasets.

Result: Med-URWKV outperforms or matches the segmentation performance of other RWKV models trained from scratch across seven datasets.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of using pre-trained VRWKV encoders for medical image segmentation is validated, marking Med-URWKV as an advancement in the field.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study develops an AI algorithm to screen digital pathology slides for 10 artifact types, improving detection accuracy and aiding quality review processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality assurance in digital pathology is crucial as artifacts can negatively impact AI diagnostic models and diagnostic outcomes.

Method: The paper uses annotated slide images, ablation studies, and InceptionResNet to design artifact detection models.

Result: A hybrid model approach was proposed with both single artifact binary models and limited multiple instance models for optimal artifact detection.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of combining single and multi-instance models for better quality assurance in digital pathology.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using adaptive distributed CNNs optimized for IoT devices to enhance wireless image classification under varying resource and channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices face computational constraints for local inference, highlighting the need for adaptive solutions to efficiently transmit and process sensor data over noisy wireless channels.

Method: The authors propose using a Learning-Assisted Intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA), coupled with Random Forest-based learning, to adaptively configure CNNs based on SNR and computational limits.

Result: Experiments show up to 10% improvement in classification accuracy even at extremely low SNR (-10dB) and diverse computational budgets, outperforming conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive framework enhances classification performance under resource and channel constraints, offering scalable solutions for IoT-edge setups.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-intensive applications face inefficiencies in database systems, including excessive loading time, resource overuse, and suboptimal allocation, necessitating a more efficient hybrid framework.

Method: The authors propose RAW-HF, a lightweight framework with specific modules to optimize resource usage and workload execution for querying raw data across in-house and cloud resources.

Result: RAW-HF achieved over 90% and 85% reductions in workload execution time (WET) for datasets like SDSS and LOD compared to PostgreSQL, alongside reduced CPU, IO, and memory costs compared to workload-aware partial loading techniques.

Conclusion: RAW-HF effectively optimizes workload execution and resource allocation, establishing itself as a superior alternative to both traditional DBMS and partial workload-aware hybrid systems.

Abstract: Scientific experiments and modern applications are generating large amounts
of data every day. Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud
resources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database
management system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time & resources to
load the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other
hand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing
resource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or
under-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This
paper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &Workload aware Hybrid
Framework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite
resources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources
required to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing
resources. The impact of applying RAW-HF to real-world scientific dataset
workloads like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Linked Observation Data
(LOD) presented over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time (WET)
compared to widely used traditional DBMS PostgreSQL. The overall CPU, IO
resource utilization, and WET have been reduced by 26%, 25%, and 26%,
respectively, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to the
state-of-the-art workload-aware partial loading technique (WA) proposed for
hybrid systems. A comparison of MUAR technique used by RAW-HF with machine
learning based resource allocation techniques like PCC is also presented.

TL;DR: The study proposes a transformer-based reinforcement learning framework for aerodynamic lift control in gust sequences, outpacing linear strategies and demonstrating generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear flow control strategies struggle with strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, necessitating better frameworks for robust aerodynamic lift regulation.

Method: A transformer-based RL framework was developed, leveraging pretraining with expert (linear control) policy and task-level transfer learning for accelerated training and effective pitch control.

Result: The RL-based strategy consistently outperformed traditional linear control, generalized to arbitrarily long gust sequences, and showed enhanced lift regulation with quarter-chord pitching.

Conclusion: The transformer-based RL framework, combined with acceleration techniques, presents a robust and generalizable solution for aerodynamic flow control, addressing demanding scenarios effectively.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and high-fidelity fluid dynamics simulation is critical for advancing scientific and engineering applications, addressing limitations of computational costs, instability, and data requirements in existing methods.

Method: The paper proposes OmniFluids, a framework that integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning into its architecture, leveraging mixture of operators, multi-frame decoders, and factorized Fourier layers.

Result: OmniFluids achieves 10-100x speedups over traditional solvers in reconstructing flow fields and turbulence statistics, demonstrating high accuracy and effective recovery of unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy datasets.

Conclusion: OmniFluids establishes a robust paradigm for surrogate modeling in fluid dynamics, enabling efficient and scalable solutions even under limited data availability.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current testing frameworks for O-RAN components are manual, error-prone, fragmented, and lack scalability, highlighting the need for automated, accurate, and efficient testing frameworks.

Method: AI5GTest employs a cooperative LLM framework with three components: Gen-LLM (generates procedural flows), Val-LLM (validates signaling compliance and detects anomalies), and Debug-LLM (performs root cause analysis). It also incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism for specification validation.

Result: AI5GTest significantly reduces test execution time while maintaining high validation accuracy across diverse test cases from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT specifications.

Conclusion: AI5GTest represents a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional manual testing methods, enhancing scalability, accuracy, and transparency in O-RAN testing processes.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lunar communication models lack adaptive, real-time decision-making capabilities, which are essential for robustness in disruptions and context sensitivity.

Method: A semantic agentic layer was introduced through MCP and A2A protocols, enabling distributed cognitive agents in rovers and base stations for enhanced decision-making.

Result: Agents demonstrated capabilities like delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression, showcasing better coordination for lunar mission tasks.

Conclusion: This approach enhances lunar communication robustness and adaptability, advancing the autonomy and efficiency of lunar surface operations.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that accurate and efficient traffic classification on low-power microcontrollers is feasible, contributing to better IoT security solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for

ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

### [379] [Exploring Topological and Localization Phenomena in SSH Chains under Generalized AAH Modulation: A Computational Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10195)
*Souvik Ghosh,Sayak Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This study investigates extended versions of the SSH model, considering quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving, and uncovers phenomena like localization transitions, the non-Hermitian skin effect, and Floquet-engineered topological phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how the canonical SSH model behaves when generalized under realistic and complex conditions, such as quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and driving forces.

Method: The methods include computational approaches like exact diagonalization, specialized numerical solvers, and unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to classify system phases based on spectral and localization properties.

Result: The study finds that under certain conditions, topologically protected edge states are destroyed by localization, non-Hermitian systems exhibit dramatic boundary localization, and periodic Floquet drives can create topological phases in trivial systems.

Conclusion: The findings expand the understanding of generalized SSH models by detailing how additional complexities affect topological and localization properties, revealing the potential for engineering novel phases in these systems.

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

*Jingxuan Ding,Laura Zichi,Matteo Carli,Menghang Wang,Albert Musaelian,Yu Xie,Boris Kozinsky*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This study uses quantum-accurate simulations and machine learning to model and analyze the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in solid-state batteries, uncovering a new crystalline disordered phase and key lithium motion mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand and control atomistic-level processes governing the formation of the SEI in solid-state batteries, addressing challenges in experimental characterization and simulation limitations.

Method: Large-scale reactive simulations with quantum accuracy were conducted using deep equivariant neural network potentials combined with active learning and unsupervised classification techniques for analyzing local atomic environments.

Result: The study identified a new crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI and revealed lithium motion mechanisms along the interface critical for dendrite initiation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the importance of explicitly modeling reaction and transport kinetics and offers a framework for understanding complex processes in solid-state battery systems, providing predictive insights without reliance on experimentally-fitted parameters.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

### [381] [Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156)
*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper examines the effect of data quantity versus the number of channels on the quality of ICA decomposition, using AMICA as the framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address how the quantity of EEG data and number of channels influence the quality of ICA decomposition, filling gaps in understanding optimal EEG data collection practices.

Method: The authors used a 71-channel dataset covering 13 subjects and randomly subsampled varying data quantities to achieve different data-to-channel ratios. Decomposition quality was measured using mutual information reduction (MIR) and near dipolarity metrics.

Result: An asymptotic trend in MIR and a rising trend in near dipolarity were observed with increasing data quantity. However, no definitive plateau was reached, indicating further potential benefits from additional EEG data collection.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that collecting more EEG data might continue to improve ICA decomposition quality, challenging common heuristic thresholds for data collection.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

*Eun Som Jeon,Sinjini Mitra,Jisoo Lee,Omik M. Save,Ankita Shukla,Hyunglae Lee,Pavan Turaga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework to improve GRF estimation using wearable insole sensors, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRF estimation methods using instrumented treadmills are costly and non-portable, while wearable insole sensors face challenges of noise and inaccuracy.

Method: A novel Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework is introduced, using similarity and temporal features to better capture relationships and sequential properties during knowledge transfer.

Result: Empirical testing shows that the framework achieves superior GRF estimation accuracy compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The Time-aware Knowledge Distillation approach enhances the reliability and utility of wearable sensor data for GRF estimation, addressing practical limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

### [383] [Faster CONGEST Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Weighted Independent Set in Sparse Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10845)
*Salwa Faour,Fabian Kuhn*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper analyzes deterministic distributed algorithms for the maximum weight independent set (MWIS) problem in trees and graphs with bounded arboricity, achieving tight complexity bounds and improving prior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of approximating the maximum weight independent set (MWIS) problem efficiently in a distributed setting, particularly for sparse graph families such as trees and graphs with bounded arboricity.

Method: The paper provides tight bounds for MWIS in trees, develops algorithms leveraging the local rounding framework for arboricity-bounded graphs, and designs a method to compute independent sets with weight guarantees in terms of node degrees.

Result: The authors proved tight \( \Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon) \) complexity for MWIS in trees and proposed two improved approximation algorithms for arboricity-bounded graphs, outperforming recent results in both quality of approximation and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper establishes new bounds and improved algorithms for MWIS in both trees and bounded-arboricity graphs, advancing the understanding and capability of solving this problem in distributed computational settings.

Abstract: The maximum independent set problem is a classic optimization problem that
has also been studied quite intensively in the distributed setting. While the
problem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation
algorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider
deterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the
problem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.
  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set
(MWIS) problem has a tight $\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)$ complexity. The lower
bound already holds on unweighted oriented paths. On the upper bound side, we
show that the bound can be achieved even in unrooted trees.
  For graphs $G=(V,E)$ of arboricity $\beta>1$, we give two algorithms. If the
sum of all node weights is $w(V)$, we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, an
independent set of weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\cdot \frac{w(V)}{4\beta}$ can
be computed in $O(\log^2(\beta/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$ rounds. This
result is obtained by a direct application of the local rounding framework of
Faour, Ghaffari, Grunau, Kuhn, and Rozho\v{n} [SODA '23]. We further show that
for any $\epsilon>0$, an independent set of weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{w(V)}{2\beta+1}$ can be computed in
$O(\log^3(\beta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2 \cdot\log n)$ rounds. This
improves on a recent result of Gil [OPODIS '23], who showed that a
$1/\lfloor(2+\epsilon)\beta\rfloor$-approximation to the MWIS problem can be
computed in $O(\beta\cdot\log n)$ rounds. As an intermediate step, we design an
algorithm to compute an independent set of total weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\sum_{v\in V}\frac{w(v)}{deg(v)+1}$ in time
$O(\log^3(\Delta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$, where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of the graph.

*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FastFLUX, a pruning-oriented framework, accelerates inference in large text-to-image models like FLUX while maintaining high image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow inference, high memory usage, and deployability challenges of massive parameter-sized models like FLUX.

Method: FastFLUX uses Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) to replace complex residual branches with linear layers and Sandwich Training (ST) for localized fine-tuning to maintain performance stability.

Result: FastFLUX achieved significant inference speed improvements while retaining high image quality, even with 20% component reduction.

Conclusion: FastFLUX is a promising solution to enhance deployability of large-scale T2I models by improving efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

*Giannis Daras,Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ambient Diffusion Omni, a framework that uses low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to enhance diffusion models for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typical diffusion models are trained on highly curated datasets, neglecting low-quality data sources that could still provide valuable signals for training.

Method: The framework leverages spectral power law decay and locality in natural images. It incorporates noise to mitigate skew between high-quality and mixed distributions, allowing successful training on corrupted images.

Result: The framework enables state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet FID and improves text-to-image generation in terms of quality and diversity.

Conclusion: Low-quality and synthetic images, when properly utilized with the presented framework, can significantly enhance the performance of diffusion models, offering a principled alternative to strictly curated training datasets.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

### [386] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework, LDEM, for creating density-equalizing maps while resolving accuracy, bijectivity, and scalability issues seen in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DEM techniques face issues such as limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts, and difficulty in transitioning from 2D to 3D due to derivative-dependent energy formulations.

Method: A learning-based framework using deep neural networks with a novel loss function for density uniformity and geometric regularity, employing hierarchical prediction for coarse and dense transformations.

Result: The method outperforms traditional techniques in density-equalizing and bijectivity properties, handles complex distributions well, and transitions seamlessly from 2D to 3D without model or loss alterations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and robust solution for generating density-equalizing maps, unlocking new applications across diverse domains.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

*Zaiqiang Wu,Yechen Li,Jingyuan Liu,Yuki Shibata,Takayuki Hori,I-Chao Shen,Takeo Igarashi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel virtual try-on method using real human bodies instead of costly robotic mannequins, improving garment alignment and user-garment interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods are limited in view angles, real-time interaction, and require expensive and unnatural robotic mannequins with alignment inaccuracies.

Method: The authors propose a low-cost data collection approach using real human bodies and introduce a hybrid representation combining DensePose mapping for better alignment and interaction.

Result: Through qualitative, quantitative, and ablation studies, the proposed method exhibits superior image quality, temporal consistency, and usability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances virtual try-on systems, providing a more accessible and accurate tool for consumers when evaluating garment purchases.

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Edit360, a framework leveraging video diffusion models to achieve multi-view consistent 3D editing based on 2D modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance 3D asset editing capabilities, especially for fine-grained and multi-view consistent edits, as current methods are confined to limited viewpoints.

Method: Edit360 uses video diffusion models with an Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism that aligns and merges multi-view information within latent and attention spaces, ensuring 360-degree coherence in edits.

Result: Edit360 allows for user-specific 3D asset edits from arbitrary viewpoints while maintaining structural coherence across all views, facilitating the creation of high-quality 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: Edit360 represents a significant advancement in 3D editing by enabling tuning-free and coherent modifications across various angles, enhancing practical applications in customizable 3D content creation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

### [389] [Transformer IMU Calibrator: Dynamic On-body IMU Calibration for Inertial Motion Capture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10580)
*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time calibration specifically for sparse inertial motion capture systems, breaking the traditional static assumption in IMU calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static calibration assumptions of IMU systems limit their application to broader, dynamic motion scenarios. This restriction calls for a novel approach that accommodates changing conditions and ensures accurate motion capture.

Method: The authors propose a Transformer-based model to estimate calibration matrices RG'G and RBS in real-time under relaxed assumptions. They used synthetic datasets for model training and designed a trigger system to ensure robust calibration inputs.

Result: The method allows for implicit, real-time calibration of IMU systems without explicit pre-calibration steps. It demonstrates improved accuracy and long-term usability for sparse IMU-based motion capture.

Conclusion: This study pioneers in removing exclusive static constraints in IMU calibration, enabling seamless and practical deployment of sparse inertial systems for diverse motion applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: The study evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for identifying vulnerabilities in Python code, finding that few-shot prompting and confidence-based routing strategies significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasingly complex cyber threats, there is a pressing need for faster and more accurate methods of detecting software vulnerabilities.

Method: The study uses zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies to classify Python code with known vulnerabilities.

Result: Few-shot prompting, combined with confidence-based routing strategies, significantly improves performance and enables better human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Although promising as scalable tools for vulnerability assessment, challenges such as reliability and robustness remain. AI-human collaboration can enhance cybersecurity workflows with reduced human burden.

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

*Muqi Zou,Hongyu Cai,Hongwei Wu,Zion Leonahenahe Basque,Arslan Khan,Berkay Celik,Dave,Tian,Antonio Bianchi,Ruoyu,Wang,Dongyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: D-LiFT is a novel automated system that refines decompiled code using reinforcement learning with an emphasis on preserving accuracy alongside readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decompiled code often has errors making it difficult to read, and current methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce new issues while failing to ensure accuracy.

Method: D-LiFT employs reinforcement learning and integrates D-SCORE, a multi-aspect quality assessment system, ensuring code accuracy before optimizing readability.

Result: Using D-SCORE, D-LiFT achieves a 55.3% improvement in decompiled functions' quality over baseline LLMs.

Conclusion: D-LiFT demonstrates the ability to significantly enhance decompiled code, adhering to the principle of preserving accuracy while improving readability.

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

### [392] [ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323)
*Chuyang Chen,Brendan Dolan-Gavitt,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELFuzz, a system for generating fuzzers using large language models to test software. It surpasses manual and other automated methods in coverage and bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of input grammars and semantic constraints for generation-based fuzzing is labor-intensive. The paper aims to automate this process efficiently for large-scale systems.

Method: ELFuzz uses a large language model to evolve minimal seed fuzzers into comprehensive fuzzers by leveraging coverage guidance. It applies synthesis techniques by navigating a 'fuzzer space'.

Result: ELFuzz significantly outperformed expert-written specifications and state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 434.8% higher coverage and up to 174.0% more bug detection. It also found five 0-day bugs, three of which were exploitable.

Conclusion: ELFuzz demonstrates the ability to automate the creation of efficient fuzzers, achieving superior results in code coverage and bug detection, with human-understandable outputs.

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

### [393] [From Threat to Tool: Leveraging Refusal-Aware Injection Attacks for Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10020)
*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RAAI repurposes attack techniques to generate data for safer LLM alignment, avoiding complex methods and improving robustness against harmful prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to address the challenges of costly and time-consuming human-labeled preference data in aligning LLMs, exploring synthetic data generation instead.

Method: RAAI identifies refusal signals and injects phrases to induce harmful completions directly, without requiring training or additional models.

Result: RAAI improved harmful response rates in LLM jailbreak experiments from 2.15% to an average of 61.04% across benchmarks. Fine-tuning with its synthetic data also enhanced model robustness.

Conclusion: RAAI demonstrates the potential of repurposing LLM attack methods as scalable tools for safety alignment, maintaining model competence in general tasks while enhancing robustness against harmful prompts.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

### [394] [LLMs Caught in the Crossfire: Malware Requests and Jailbreak Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10022)
*Haoyang Li,Huan Gao,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zhiyu Lin,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MalwareBench, containing 3,520 crafted prompts for testing LLM vulnerabilities in malicious code generation, revealing weaknesses in current models' capabilities to reject such content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding LLM vulnerabilities specifically in the context of jailbreak attacks for malicious code generation.

Method: Developed MalwareBench with 320 crafted requirements that employ multiple jailbreak methods across diverse code functionalities to assess LLM robustness.

Result: Mainstream LLMs show limited capabilities: average rejection rate of malicious content is 60.93% but drops to 39.92% with combined attack strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate inadequate robustness against malicious code-generation jailbreak attacks, posing security challenges that need attention.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

### [395] [Private Memorization Editing: Turning Memorization into a Defense to Strengthen Data Privacy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10024)
*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method named Private Memorization Editing (PME) to mitigate LLMs' risk of leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by editing memorized knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent the leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which may be memorized by Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their training on large amounts of uncontrolled data.

Method: The method, PME, detects memorized PII in LLMs and mitigates its memorization by editing the model's knowledge while maintaining its foundational capabilities.

Result: PME robustly reduces the number of leaked PII, even nullifying the accuracy of privacy attacks in some configurations, while preserving the LLM's functionality.

Conclusion: PME successfully transforms the memorization issue of LLMs from a limitation to a privacy-enhancing feature, improving resilience against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing cybersecurity challenges posed by large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini as their applications expand.

Method: The authors conduct a comparative analysis of ChatGPT and Gemini's security and alignment levels and categorize jailbreak techniques based on experiments.

Result: The paper outlines the security strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT and Gemini and provides a taxonomy of jailbreak methods observed in the experiments.

text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt

*Tianyu Chen,Jian Lou,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents AQUA, the first framework for watermarking image knowledge in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, ensuring copyright protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap of copyright protection for image knowledge in RAG systems as existing methods only address textual knowledge.

Method: AQUA embeds imperceptible semantic watermark signals into synthetic images using acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues.

Result: AQUA ensures watermark signals are effective, stealthy, and survive indirect propagation, proving robust across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: AQUA serves as an innovative solution for copyright protection in shared multimodal RAG systems by enabling reliable watermarking for image content.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMPL, a framework to stress-test privacy vulnerabilities in conversational agents using multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in personal assistants and other conversational agents that handle sensitive data.

Method: The proposed CMPL framework uses iterative probing to simulate realistic multi-turn interactions and uncovers privacy vulnerabilities.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates CMPL's effectiveness in identifying latent privacy risks that evade single-turn defenses.

Conclusion: CMPL serves as a diagnostic tool for auditing conversational privacy, complemented by quantifiable metrics and an open benchmark for evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

### [399] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GenBreak is a framework designed to expose safety vulnerabilities in text-to-image models by systematically generating adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating safety risks in text-to-image models by effectively uncovering vulnerabilities related to harmful content generation.

Method: Fine-tuning a large language model on supervised datasets and reinforcement learning via interactions with a surrogate T2I model to optimize adversarial prompt generation.

Result: Effective black-box attacks on commercial T2I models, unveiling safety vulnerabilities such as the generation of harmful or toxic images.

Conclusion: GenBreak highlights the weaknesses in safety mechanisms of text-to-image models, facilitating improved understanding and prompting advancement in safeguarding such systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reliability of machine unlearning techniques and reveals vulnerabilities in certain methods when subjected to prompt attacks. It provides a systematic evaluation framework for assessing unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the effectiveness of machine unlearning techniques and understand whether claimed knowledge removal truly occurs or if the systems are only superficially suppressing outputs.

Method: Eight unlearning techniques were systematically evaluated across three model families using output-based analysis, logit-based analysis, and probe analysis, combined with specific prompt attacks.

Result: Methods like RMU and TAR demonstrated robust unlearning, while ELM remained vulnerable, showing 57.3% recovered accuracy with specific prompt attacks. Strong correlation between output and logit accuracy indicated true removal rather than format modification.

Conclusion: Prevailing assumptions about machine unlearning are challenged, revealing vulnerabilities and emphasizing the need for robust evaluation frameworks. A public evaluation framework for assessing unlearning techniques has been provided.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns posed by fine-tuned LLMs involving sensitive data and assess their vulnerability against attacks exposing training data.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of membership inference attacks on fine-tuned LLMs, followed by the development of SOFT using influential data selection based on an adjustable parameter.

Result: SOFT demonstrates effective mitigation of privacy leakage across six domains and multiple LLM architectures while preserving model utility.

Conclusion: SOFT offers a scalable solution to enhance privacy in fine-tuned LLMs, marking a significant step toward secure AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Motivation: To define, specify, and evaluate the unused potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems in niche applications, especially where reasoning and specialized capabilities are required.

Method: An architecture and prototype extended from prior research are introduced along with a specification for multi-agent systems. System evaluation is conducted through test cases in cybersecurity areas.

Result: Test cases in cybersecurity (question answering, server security, and network security) were successfully completed using OpenAI and DeepSeek LLM agents.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM systems are effective for complex tasks in specific domains, and their feasibility has been demonstrated in cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the concern that traditional cryptographic methods may not be resilient against future quantum computer threats, highlighting the need for advanced security measures in cloud computing.

Method: The study employs Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with the BB84 protocol to establish secure keys, alongside Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP) for encryption/decryption, ensuring enhanced data protection in the cloud.

Result: The implementation of QKD (BB84) and QOTP demonstrates a secure framework for protecting cloud-based data, safeguarding it against hacking attempts even by attackers with quantum computing capabilities.

Conclusion: Integrating quantum cryptography methods into cloud security systems provides a scalable and future-resilient approach to maintaining data confidentiality and integrity in the face of advancing technological threats.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented landscape of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs and provide a structured foundation for improving their effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy with six dimensions, introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework, and conduct extensive analysis to assess guardrail approaches.

Result: The paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of existing guardrails, examines their applicability across attack types, and offers insights into optimizing defense combinations.

Conclusion: This work serves as a guide for advancing robust LLM guardrails, offering a framework for unified evaluation and structured future research developments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled

*Xiaoxing Mo,Yuxuan Cheng,Nan Sun,Leo Yu Zhang,Wei Luo,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks to adaptive backdoor attacks by introducing a defense method named TED-LaST, which improves the robustness of existing Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TED-based methods for backdoor attack detection are susceptible to adaptive attack strategies that distort topological representations, making them ineffective in identifying advanced threats.

Method: The proposed TED-LaST integrates label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis to improve TED's capability in detecting stealthy backdoor attacks. Additionally, it classifies existing attack strategies and introduces an enhanced adaptive attack with target mapping.

Result: TED-LaST demonstrated effective counteraction of advanced backdoor attacks, including Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch, and enhanced adaptive attacks, across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and ImageNet100) and architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101).

Conclusion: TED-LaST significantly improves the robustness of DNN defense systems, setting new standards for backdoor detection and enhancing the security of neural networks against evolving and adaptive threats.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces new datasets and proposes the Multi-Element (ME) attack method, improving SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) attacks on text-to-image diffusion models by adding more visual-text elements and using Discrete Cosine Transform for stealth. Results show improved effectiveness compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in data resources and existing techniques for attacking diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, specifically enhancing performance in conditions with few poisoned samples.

Method: The paper introduces new datasets and proposes a Multi-Element (ME) attack method, which includes increasing visual-text elements per sample and using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to improve stealthiness during attacks.

Result: On the new datasets, the proposed method achieved higher Copyright Infringement Rates (CIR) and better First Attack Epochs (FAE) compared to benchmark datasets and the original SBD technique, especially in low subsampling ratios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances the capability of attacking diffusion models with limited data resources, offering a more effective and stealthy solution than existing methods like SBD.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than

### [407] [A Crack in the Bark: Leveraging Public Knowledge to Remove Tree-Ring Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10502)
*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel attack targeting the Tree-Ring watermarking technique reduces the detection effectiveness significantly by exploiting publicly available variational autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify vulnerabilities in the Tree-Ring watermarking technique for diffusion models and assess the potential risks associated with public variational autoencoders.

Method: The attack uses the publicly available variational autoencoder of the targeted diffusion model to approximate its latent space, facilitating more effective surrogate-based attacks.

Result: The attack dramatically decreases the Tree-Ring detector's AUC for ROC and PR curves from 0.993 to 0.153 and 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: The study highlights the risks of reusing public autoencoders in diffusion models and critiques the practicality of Tree-Ring detectors for real-world applications due to their low precision under attack.

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

### [408] [Assessing the Resilience of Automotive Intrusion Detection Systems to Adversarial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10620)
*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks on automotive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) under varying degrees of system knowledge (white-box, grey-box, and black-box) using publicly available datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the vulnerabilities of automotive systems due to the lack of robust security in the CAN bus, highlighting the susceptibility of vehicles to adversarial attacks that can bypass IDS mechanisms.

Method: The authors investigate gradient-based adversarial attacks under three knowledge scenarios (white-box, grey-box, black-box) and use two datasets to evaluate attack effectiveness. They also assess real-time attack feasibility through precomputed evasive payloads.

Result: The study finds that the success of adversarial attacks is influenced by automotive constraints, dataset quality, IDS design, and the attacker's knowledge level. Real-time feasibility of such attacks is also validated.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose a practical cybersecurity threat to automotive IDS solutions, especially under certain conditions. Enhancing IDS design and dataset quality is critical to mitigating these risks.

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

### [409] [Monitoring Decomposition Attacks in LLMs with Lightweight Sequential Monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10949)
*Chen Yueh-Han,Nitish Joshi,Yulin Chen,Maksym Andriushchenko,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses decomposition attacks in LLMs and proposes a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that detects malicious intent across a conversation, achieving a 93% defense success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current LLM safety defenses, which fail to detect decomposed malicious intent across a sequence of seemingly benign instructions.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that evaluates subtasks cumulatively, utilizing curated datasets and prompt engineering to enhance defense against decomposition attacks.

Result: The proposed monitoring framework achieved a 93% success rate in defending against decomposition attacks and showed robustness against injected random tasks, while significantly reducing cost (90%) and latency (50%).

Conclusion: Lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in mitigating decomposition attacks and provide a cost-efficient and deployable safety mechanism.

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

### [410] [Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End-collaborative Metaverse Services Architecure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10001)
*Yuxuan Li,Sheng Jinag,Bizhu Wang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper addresses bandwidth and quality issues in the metaverse by proposing a novel architecture, SC-CEE-Meta, which significantly reduces delay and improves image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the metaverse presents challenges in transmitting massive data like high-resolution VR scenes, especially due to bandwidth limitations and poor channel quality that degrade user experience.

Method: The paper proposes the SC-CEE-Meta architecture, featuring semantic communication-enabled modules for VR devices and edge servers. It focuses on transmitting key semantic information rather than bit-level data, and employs cloud and edge collaboration for efficient data processing and rendering.

Result: The SC-CEE-Meta architecture achieved a 96.05% reduction in wireless transmission delay and a 43.99% improvement in image quality in poor channel conditions when tested on Meta Quest Pro.

Conclusion: SC-CEE-Meta effectively addresses the issues of latency, resource-bandwidth conflicts, and channel interference in immersive metaverse services, providing a significant enhancement in user experience.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

*Jianwu Fang,Lei-Lei Li,Zhedong Zheng,Hongkai Yu,Jianru Xue,Zhengguo Li,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model to anticipate traffic accidents by synthesizing accident-related video clips, instead of relying on labor-intensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing traffic fatalities and addressing the limitations of conventional Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) methods, which struggle with data bias and require extensive annotations.

Method: The AVD model generates causal accident-related video frames using text prompts while preserving frame quality. It synergizes with Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) through an equivariant triple loss strategy, contrasting generated accident-free and accident video clips.

Result: AVD and EQ-TAA show competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods in extensive experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches minimize the need for additional annotations, alleviate background confounding issues, and enhance TAA performance effectively.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

content creation and consumption. In XR, users integrate various sensory inputs
to form a cohesive perception of the virtual environment. This survey reviews
the state-of-the-art in XR streaming, focusing on multiple paradigms. To begin,
we define XR and introduce various XR headsets along with their multimodal
interaction methods to provide a foundational understanding. We then analyze XR
traffic characteristics to highlight the unique data transmission requirements.
We also explore factors that influence the quality of experience in XR systems,
aiming to identify key elements for enhancing user satisfaction. Following
this, we present visual attention-based optimization methods for XR streaming
to improve efficiency and performance. Finally, we examine current applications
and highlight challenges to provide insights into ongoing and future
developments of XR.

*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bimodal machine learning framework for HER2 breast cancer assessment that achieves high accuracy with single-modality H&E or IHC images while allowing for efficient dual-modality predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HER2 breast cancer assessment typically relies on H&E and IHC images, but clinical workflows are hindered by the costs and complexities of acquiring both modalities concurrently.

Method: The authors propose a framework with three innovations: dynamic input routing based on modality availability, cross-modal GAN-based reconstruction for missing modalities, and hybrid training combining adversarial learning and multi-task optimization.

Result: The framework enhances single-modality H&E accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25% and achieves 95.09% accuracy on dual-modality inputs, with significant reliability using IHC images alone.

Conclusion: The system mitigates issues caused by missing modalities while preserving efficiency, making HER2 assessment more accessible and precise across diverse healthcare environments.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation by introducing a multimodal, diffusion-based framework, enhancing both emotion control and animation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to 3D facial animation rely on single-modal signals and deterministic methods, which limit emotional expressiveness and animation quality.

Method: The authors propose a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy using contrastive learning and an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers.

Result: The approach improves emotion similarity by 21.6% compared to existing methods and ensures realistic facial dynamics.

Conclusion: By integrating multimodal emotion signals and leveraging diffusion models, the proposed method significantly advances emotional 3D facial animation, enhancing both control and expressiveness.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical knowledge graph framework to analyze visual narratives like comics, focusing on relationships across narrative levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance structured understanding of visual narratives, addressing the complexity of semantics, temporal, and spatial elements in comics.

Method: The authors create multimodal and hierarchical knowledge graphs representing both macro-level story arcs and fine-grained events by integrating visual and textual components.

Result: The framework, tested on the Manga109 dataset, performs well in tasks like action retrieval and timeline reconstruction, showing high precision and recall.

Conclusion: This research offers a scalable framework for storytelling and content analysis, enabling reasoning and enhancing the understanding of multimodal visual media.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper proposes WDMIR, a framework that uses wavelet-driven techniques to integrate video, audio, and text information for better intent recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal intent recognition approaches emphasize text analysis but often neglect the semantic richness of non-verbal cues.

Method: The authors propose a wavelet-driven fusion module for frequency-based analysis of video-audio features and introduce a cross-modal interaction mechanism for progressive integration of verbal and non-verbal data.

Result: The WDMIR framework outperforms previous methods, improving accuracy by 1.13%, and ablation studies show significant benefits in recognizing subtle emotional cues.

Conclusion: Wavelet-driven analysis enhances multimodal understanding by bridging verbal and non-verbal gaps, paving the way for better intent recognition frameworks.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Result: Identification of key models, architectural trends, cross-modal synergies, and unresolved challenges in modularity, evaluation, and reasoning.

Conclusion: The survey provides a unified view, highlighting critical paths toward more adaptive, interpretable, and general-purpose multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

### [418] [Multimodal Emotion Coupling via Speech-to-Facial and Bodily Gestures in Dyadic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10010)
*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The study investigates multimodal emotion coupling, examining how speech features (prosody, MFCCs, arousal, valence) correlate with facial and hand movements during dyadic interactions. Findings show distinct patterns: nonoverlapping speech drives greater expressivity, while overlapping speech impacts emotional clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how speech, facial, and gestural signals coordinate during emotional expression is essential for improving real-time emotion detection systems.

Method: The study analyzed dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP corpus, using speech features and 3D motion capture to map relationships between speech and physical gestures.

Result: Nonoverlapping speech heightened expressivity, especially in the lower face. Sadness increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed gestures during overlaps. Prosody and MFCCs showed strong predictive mapping for articulatory movements, whereas arousal and valence had lower correlations.

Conclusion: Speech-gesture synchrony varies by emotional context and conversational structure, providing insights for refining multimodal emotion detection in human and AI systems.

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper extends the concept of Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and creates a regularized version applicable to all Gaussian measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to generalize the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, traditionally used in finite-dimensional settings, to Gaussian measures in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Method: They derive closed-form expressions for the divergence in infinite dimensions and define a regularized version using Log-Determinant divergences to address cases involving arbitrary Gaussian measures.

Result: A novel Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence is introduced, which converges to the exact value of Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence for equivalent Gaussian measures as the regularization parameter approaches zero.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical framework for using the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence in infinite-dimensional settings and shows its applicability in a broader class of Gaussian measures through regularization.

Abstract: This work studies the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, based on the
notion of geometric mean of probability measures, in the setting of Gaussian
measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. On the set of all Gaussian
measures equivalent to a fixed one, we present a closed form expression for
this divergence that directly generalizes the finite-dimensional version. Using
the notion of Log-Determinant divergences between positive definite unitized
trace class operators, we then define a Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon
divergence that is valid for any pair of Gaussian measures and that recovers
the exact Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence between two equivalent Gaussian
measures when the regularization parameter tends to zero.

TL;DR: This pilot study explores the use of humanoid robots in action observation therapy by analyzing EEG responses to observed actions performed by both robots and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether humanoid robots can support action observation therapy in rehabilitation settings, leveraging neural responses to observed actions.

Method: The study monitored EEG data from three healthy participants as they observed 8 actions performed by human and robot agents. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed to study neural activity.

Result: Participants demonstrated variability in ERSP patterns, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to robot actions, and positive ERSP correlations across conditions suggest common neural networks at play.

Conclusion: EEG-based analysis is feasible for studying neural responses in action observation therapy, and the findings support further exploration of humanoid robots for rehabilitation.

Abstract: Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for
motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological
conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential
of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain
activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with
electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions
performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right
arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the
spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus,
compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject
analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including
power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed
stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong
and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for
almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or
neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results
support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses
to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.

*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Diffusion models are used in seismic imaging to integrate a generative prior into Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), avoiding noisy intermediate states and improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current use of diffusion models in seismic imaging faces challenges due to instability caused by noisy intermediate states, especially when applied to non-linear solvers like FWI.

Method: Proposed a framework that integrates pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) as score-based diffusion priors directly into FWI, using a score rematching strategy to bypass the reverse diffusion process and operate in clean image space.

Result: The approach offers better stability, improves inversion convergence, and provides higher quality and robustness compared to traditional and GAN-based methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances seismic imaging by providing an efficient, practical, and noise-resistant alternative that can integrate well with existing pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

### [422] [Self-learning signal classifier for decameter coherent scatter radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10305)
*Oleg Berngardt,Ivan Lavygin*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops an automatic classifier for radar data using ionospheric modeling and radar parameters, achieving 14 robustly identifiable data classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interpretation of radar data by developing a method for automatic classification of such data using ionospheric modeling and radar measurements.

Method: The approach involves training a model on data from 12 radars over two years, with 2669 coefficients in the final classifier. It incorporates calibrated radar elevation measurements and uses parameters such as ray-tracing trajectory, scattering height, and Doppler velocity.

Result: The optimal number of classes identified in the radar data is 37, with 14 being robustly separable. Preliminary interpretation was completed for 10 classes, and dependencies on radar latitude and solar/geomagnetic activity were examined.

Conclusion: The introduced classification method aligns with known physical mechanisms and relies on radar signal parameters critically influencing class identification.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

### [423] [Equitable Mechanism Design for Facility Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10460)
*Toby Walsh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper examines strategy-proof mechanisms for facility location, focusing on equitability measured via the Gini index, and provides results on approximation ratios for a complemented Gini index and Nash welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to design mechanisms for facility location that are both strategy-proof and equitable, addressing challenges posed by inequality in agent utilities.

Method: They analyze mechanisms through theoretical proofs, proposing approximation metrics based on the complemented Gini index and exploring deterministic and randomized solutions for fair facility allocation.

Result: No strategy-proof mechanism can guarantee optimal Gini index approximation; however, the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare measures are employed to assess well-performing mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper highlights fundamental limitations of current approaches but suggests practical metrics to balance strategy-proofness and equitability in facility location problems.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

*Haoyuan Shi,Yunxin Li,Xinyu Chen,Longyue Wang,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces AniMaker, a multi-agent framework for generating coherent storytelling videos solely from text input, solving issues like disjointed narratives and pacing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with creating coherent multi-scene storytelling due to disjointed keyframe conversion and instability in video generation.

Method: AniMaker uses a multi-agent setup with a Director Agent, Photography Agent, Reviewer Agent, and Post-Production Agent. It features MCTS-Gen for efficient clip generation and AniEval for evaluating multi-shot animations.

Result: Experiments show AniMaker surpasses existing methods in quality (using metrics like VBench and AniEval) and improves the efficiency of multi-candidate video generation.

Conclusion: AniMaker marks progress in AI storytelling animations, achieving higher coherence and production-level quality efficiently.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

TL;DR: The study explores using a neuromorphic network with memristive circuits for modeling and predicting chaotic time series, optimizing performance via input electrode and voltage tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how dynamical systems can be understood and effectively modeled using neuromorphic networks that mirror such dynamics.

Method: Simulating a memristive-based neuromorphic network within a reservoir computing framework to predict multivariate chaotic time series by tuning input voltages and electrode configurations.

Result: Optimal dynamical responses were observed when input voltages fully utilized the memristors' dynamic range, while improved network coverage suppressed less effective nonlinear responses.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic networks can be optimized for learning complex dynamics through external parameter adjustments, offering practical insights for device design.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

TL;DR: This study analyzes Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), examining how hidden unit priors and their activation functions impact memory retrieval and critical capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand how architectural choices in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), particularly in hidden unit priors, affect thermodynamic properties and memory retrieval capabilities.

Method: The study combines analytical tools from statistical physics and Monte Carlo simulations to examine the phase diagram and recall performance of RBMs with different hidden unit priors.

Result: It was found that standard RBMs with binary hidden units struggle with critical capacity limitations, but modifying hidden unit configurations, such as adding local biases or richer priors, improved ordered retrieval phases and recall performance.

Conclusion: Hidden unit design plays a crucial role in enhancing RBM's effectiveness as associative memories, emphasizing the importance of architectural adjustments.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCCL, a method for matrix completion in recommender systems, focusing on denoising with contrastive learning to improve generalizability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in GNN-based matrix completion methods, which are sensitive to noisy or irrelevant edges and prone to overfitting, affecting generalizability.

Method: MCCL extracts local neighborhood subgraphs for interactions and generates two graph representations: one for denoising using GNN layers with attention and another via a graph variational autoencoder. A mutual learning loss harmonizes these representations.

Result: MCCL achieves up to 0.8% improvement in RMSE for numerical accuracy and up to 36% improvement in ranking metrics, showing superior performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MCCL successfully handles noise and enhances generalization in matrix completion, offering better accuracy and ranking effectiveness for recommender systems.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

TL;DR: This paper reviews over 50 research papers on keyphrase generation, highlighting advancements, limitations, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive review and analysis of previous research in keyphrase generation despite ongoing development.

Method: The authors analyzed over 50 research papers, examined evaluation practices, and released a strong PLM-based keyphrase generation model.

Result: The study identified critical issues in evaluation practices, including dataset similarity and metric inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Future research in keyphrase generation should address the identified evaluation issues and benefit from the released pre-trained model for development.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of synthetic test collections created by LLMs for IR system evaluation, highlights potential biases, and examines their impact on system performance comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the feasibility and reliability of using synthetic test collections generated by LLMs for Information Retrieval system evaluation, addressing challenges in generating diverse queries and obtaining relevance judgments.

Method: Synthetic test collections are constructed using LLMs to generate queries, labels, or both. Empirical assessments and a linear mixed-effects model are used to identify and validate potential biases in IR system evaluation.

Result: Bias was found to affect the absolute performance evaluation of IR systems, but its impact on relative system performance comparisons was less significant.

Conclusion: Although synthetic test collections may introduce biases, they could still be useful for relative comparisons of IR system performance. Further analyses are needed to refine their reliability.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based KGRSs struggle with sparse interaction scenarios, even when incorporating SSL to address sparsity issues.

Method: LightKG simplifies GNN layers by encoding directed relations as scalar pairs and using linear aggregation. It integrates an efficient SSL contrastive layer without subgraph generation.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios, achieving better accuracy and significantly reducing training time.

Conclusion: LightKG effectively addresses sparsity with a simpler GNN architecture and efficient SSL implementation, showcasing exceptional performance and efficiency compared to competitors.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

TL;DR: SHORE is a new framework for predicting long-term user lifetime value (LTV) in digital games, addressing issues like sparse data and outliers. It significantly outperforms existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LTV prediction in digital gaming is crucial for monetization strategies, but current methods struggle with sparse data and high-value outliers, often leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: The proposed SHORE framework combines short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks with a hybrid loss function that integrates order-preserving multi-class classification and dynamic Huber loss.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets showed SHORE achieved a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error compared to existing models during online deployment.

Conclusion: SHORE improves the robustness and accuracy of industrial-scale LTV prediction in digital games and demonstrates practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of multi-task learning using billionscale graphs, aiming to leverage graph structures for better performance, which traditional methods often overlook.

Method: Proposes a Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework with innovations like Macro Graph Bottom and Macro Prediction Tower to integrate graph information and knowledge across tasks.

Result: Extensive offline experiments on benchmark datasets show MGOE's superiority over existing methods, and online A/B tests confirm its effectiveness in billion-scale recommender systems.

Conclusion: MGOE is a significant advancement in multi-task graph-based recommendation systems, proving its capability both in controlled experiments and real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of pointwise document ranking by introducing global context through anchor-based comparisons, leading to improved relevance scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pointwise document ranking methods are highly efficient but lack context-based comparative insights, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The paper introduces the Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy, which uses an anchor document for global reference comparisons, and the Post-Aggregated with Global Context (PAGC) approach to integrate these insights efficiently in a training-free manner.

Result: Experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms traditional pointwise methods in effectiveness while maintaining similar efficiency and achieves competitive results compared to computationally expensive comparative methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating global context through anchor-based comparisons significantly improves pointwise document ranking, providing a balance between efficiency and effectiveness for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of caption variation in audio understanding by leveraging the dialogue continuation capability of large language models.

Method: The proposed method trains the model to generate responses as part of a dialogue, rather than directly producing target captions, based solely on audio captioning datasets.

Result: Experiments conducted on datasets like AudioCaps and Clotho confirm that the model can handle diverse unseen instructions and demonstrate zero-shot instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: The dialogue-based training enables effective audio comprehension and instruction-following without the need for multitask instruction tuning.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance voice conversion with reduced latency and robust performance for applications like assistive communication and entertainment.

Method: Utilizes articulatory feature space for speaker-content disentanglement and incorporates differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) for efficient vocoding.

Result: RT-VC achieves 61.4 ms CPU latency, a 13.3% improvement, while matching SOTA synthesis quality.

Conclusion: RT-VC offers significant latency reduction and maintains high synthesis quality, improving real-time voice conversion technology.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms,
representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

### [438] [Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10653)
*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel loss function and speaker code approach to improve speech recogniser adaptation using limited and unlabelled data, achieving significant word error rate improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognition systems often struggle to adapt to new speakers and environments, especially with limited and unlabelled adaptation data.

Method: The authors introduce a conditional entropy-based loss function that leverages multiple hypotheses for robust adaptation and implement a 'speaker code' for efficient speaker characterisation using minimal data.

Result: The method achieved a 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of adaptation data and 29% improvement with ten minutes on a noise-augmented Common Voice dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more robust speaker adaptation for speech recognisers, even with limited and noisy data, significantly improving recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

*Benjamin Bennetzen,Nikolaj Rossander Kristensen,Peter Buus Steffensen*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on encoding Levy's call-by-push-value lambda-calculus (CBPV) into various forms of the pi-calculus, proving soundness, completeness, conforming to Gorla’s criteria, and initiating Coq formalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore encoding of CBPV into pi-calculus to demonstrate soundness, completeness, and adhere to standards for good encodings.

Method: Uses specialized encoding into pi-i-calculus and informal proofs, alongside initiation of Coq formalization for verification.

Result: Provides sound, complete encoding satisfying Gorla’s criteria, highlights bisimulation properties, and evaluates Coq formalization feasibility.

Conclusion: The encoding of CBPV is robust, aligns with theoretical standards, satisfies criteria for good encoding, and has begun formalization progress in Coq.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

*Xiaolin Hu,Qinghua Zhou,Bogdan Grechuk,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces StepProof, a system for step-by-step autoformalization of natural language proofs into formal proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive theorem provers lack natural language interfaces and existing autoformalization methods cannot verify proofs at a granular level.

Method: StepProof divides proofs into verifiable subproofs for sentence-level verification. Minor manual adjustments to linguistic input improve its accuracy.

Result: StepProof achieves higher proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional autoformalization techniques.

Conclusion: Sentence-level verification boosts autoformalization performance, and StepProof fills a crucial gap by successfully addressing this need.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The study utilizes a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to approximate three-dimensional steady states in a global marine ecosystem model, significantly reducing computational time for the spin-up process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of reaching steady states in marine ecosystem models via spin-up iterations, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Method: The authors used precomputed steady states as training data to train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. The CVAE predicts steady states, which are then employed as initial values for spin-up iterations.

Result: The CVAE predictions result in a significant reduction in the number of spin-up iterations required, with computational savings of 50-95% depending on the stopping criterion. Results showed improved efficiency over using a mean training data initial value.

Conclusion: The conditional variational autoencoder is an effective tool for accelerating spin-up cycles in marine ecosystem models, offering considerable computational time savings while achieving reasonable accuracy.

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using NeuralGCM to simulate extreme heatwaves under climate change, showcasing superior results compared to traditional ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the upper bounds of extreme weather events is critical for risk evaluation amid climate change, but existing physics-based models either lack precision or incur high computational costs.

Method: The study employs a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and simulate worst-case heatwave trajectories, achieving computational efficiency.

Result: Applying NeuralGCM to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, the study generates temperature anomalies 3.7°C higher than the most extreme member of a 75-member physics-based ensemble, illustrating intensified atmospheric patterns.

Conclusion: Differentiable climate models like NeuralGCM offer a robust approach to crafting targeted scenarios of extreme weather under climate change, revealing the potential to explore event likelihood extremes efficiently.

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the precision of small-scale variability in weather forecasts, a critical factor for improving model accuracy and utility in practical applications.

Method: The study employs the multi-scale loss formulation in the AIFS-CRPS model, which is specifically trained using the almost fair continuous ranked probability score (afCRPS).

Result: Using the multi-scale loss formulation, the study achieved better constraints on small-scale variability without harming the overall forecasting skill of the model.

Conclusion: The multi-scale loss formulation is effective in improving machine-learned weather forecasting models, particularly for small-scale structures, and suggests potential for further research in scale-aware model development.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

*Chuqiao Zhang,Sarath Chandra Dantu,Debarghya Mitra,Dalia Chakrabarty*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper identifies critical residues in a protein using three methods based on Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs) and compares results with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and identifying critical residues in proteins are essential as they play a significant role in determining protein functionality.

Method: The study utilized molecular dynamic simulations to track the evolution of a protein. They constructed RGGs where individual residue correlations were measured using Cramer's V, applied different thresholding techniques for RGG formation, developed a ranking system based on graph differences, and analyzed dynamic variation in node degrees during simulations.

Result: The three methods identified critical residues and were evaluated by comparison with results from experimental data.

Conclusion: The proposed RGG-based framework offers promising methodologies for identifying critical residues in proteins, aligning closely with experimental results.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

TL;DR: CARE is a benchmark suite for enzyme classification and retrieval tasks, introducing a novel dataset and evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning methods lack standardized benchmarks for predicting enzyme functions from protein sequences.

Method: CARE proposes two tasks: protein sequence classification by enzyme commission (EC) number and retrieval of EC numbers given chemical reactions. It includes novel train-test splits for out-of-distribution evaluation and suggests CREEP (Contrastive Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining) as a baseline.

Result: CARE offers baselines for classification tasks and introduces an innovative method (CREEP) for retrieval tasks, with comparative analysis to CLIPZyme.

Conclusion: CARE standardizes enzyme-function predictions, providing resources and benchmarks for classification and retrieval to boost progress in this research area.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel coding scheme for identifying neo-fascist content in digital discourse and builds machine learning models to classify such speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing threat of neo-fascism to democracy and minorities, requiring effective detection methods to counteract its spread.

Method: Researchers designed a neo-fascist coding scheme supervised by political science experts, collected internet data from neo-fascist forums, annotated 1,000 posts through crowdsourcing, and leveraged NLP techniques to fine-tune classification models.

Result: The research produced the first classification models for identifying neo-fascist rhetoric using both Small and Large Language Models, validated their prevalence in forums, and highlighted the importance of societal context.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for continued efforts to combat neo-fascism using NLP tools, stressing its relevance to safeguarding democratic values.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for personalized learning experiences in online education by leveraging LLMs for customized responses to individual learner questions.

Method: The study used data from StackExchange in language learning and programming domains. It developed a validation framework and dataset, employed 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot strategies for generating answers, and evaluated responses using BERTScore, LLM evaluation, and human assessment.

Result: Providing examples to LLMs enhances their ability to deliver personalized answers effectively, as supported by comprehensive evaluations using automated and human methods.

Conclusion: LLMs can substantially improve personalized learning through tailored answers. Examples of desired responses are pivotal for optimizing their performance in adapting to individual needs.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Result: Specialized single-cell frameworks excelled in batch correction; generic SSL methods performed better in cell type annotation and multi-modal data integration.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench is a standardized benchmark offering recommendations and insights for improving single-cell analysis using SSL methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve genomic language models (gLMs) in learning sequence-to-function relationships to efficiently design synthetic DNA sequences in synthetic biology.

Method: Developed Nullsettes, a series of prediction tasks to assess gLMs' ability to predict loss-of-function mutations induced by key DNA element translocations in synthetic cassettes. Evaluated 12 state-of-the-art gLMs.

Result: Found a strong correlation between mutation effect prediction performance and the predicted likelihood of nonmutant sequences. Highlighted the role of sequence length in defining likelihood ranges linked to strong performance.

Conclusion: Both sequence likelihood and sequence length should be carefully considered when leveraging gLMs for tasks like mutation effect prediction.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing large inhomogeneous datasets by identifying homogeneous subsets that can help in disease research, particularly in patient subcohorts.

Method: An algorithm using a rounding technique similar to Goemans and Williamson's (1994) to approximate the optimal solution for identifying homogeneous subsets within large datasets.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies homogeneous patient subcohorts from RNA microarray datasets and highlights correlations between methylation levels in tumor suppressor genes and nuclear receptor expressions.

Conclusion: This method provides a significant tool for identifying homogeneous subcohorts, aiding in understanding disease pathways and developing targeted therapies.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome instability and inaccuracies in feature selection methods for Random Forests under double imbalance scenarios in classification tasks.

Method: A novel thresholding scheme exploiting the minimal depth in Random Forest trees to evaluate feature importance and select relevant variables.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved performance in terms of parsimoniousness and accuracy of the variables selected compared to traditional minimal depth approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical and interpretable solution to feature selection in Random Forests under challenging double imbalance conditions, enhancing stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

Motivation: To address limitations in Federated Audio Classification (FedAC), including data and model heterogeneity as well as vulnerability to data poisoning.

Method: FedMLAC employs a dual-model system comprising a personalized local model and a globally shared Plug-in model, using bidirectional knowledge distillation for generalization and personalization. It also adopts a Layer-wise Pruning Aggregation strategy for filtering unreliable updates.

Result: FedMLAC achieves superior classification accuracy and robustness to noisy data compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse audio classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: FedMLAC is a robust solution for real-world federated audio scenarios, effectively addressing major challenges in Federated Audio Classification through unified methodologies.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for fine-grained control in music generation by intervening during inference time on MusicGen, an autoregressive generative music transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance control over music generation by enabling capabilities such as timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion.

Method: Steering residual streams and attention layer activations using trained linear probes, modeling control as a regression task to preserve directional information.

Result: Improved control over music generation, achieving both global conditioning through text prompts and local interventions.

Conclusion: The approach advances music generation by offering high control granularity, demonstrated through audio samples shared on a demo page.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for a unified comparison of discrete audio tokenization methods across domains and tasks, as existing studies focus on specific areas.

Method: Presents a taxonomy of tokenization methods based on factors like encoder-decoder structure, quantization techniques, and streamability; evaluates these on reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic modeling benchmarks.

Result: Identified key limitations, trade-offs, and practical challenges in discrete audio tokenization, along with controlled ablation studies offering deep insights.

Conclusion: Provides critical guidance and insights for future research in the domain of discrete audio tokenization while identifying open challenges and practical considerations.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper investigates architectural modifications to improve the interaction between audio encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) for effective audio-text integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore efficient mechanisms for transferring semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs, as this area remains underexplored compared to application-focused advancements.

Method: The authors propose and systematically evaluate architectural changes, such as delayed audio integration, attention-only probing, and using an ensemble of diverse audio encoders, using a consistent training framework of 5.6M audio-text pairs.

Result: The proposed modifications led to relative performance improvements ranging from 10% to 60% compared to a baseline architecture.

Conclusion: Integrating delayed audio inputs, attention-only probing, and complementary audio encoder representations significantly enhances LLM capabilities in processing and leveraging audio information.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

### [456] [BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10754)
*Chi Zuo,Martin B. Møller,Pablo Martínez-Nuevo,Huayang Huang,Yu Wu,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework called BNMusic to blend environmental noise into personalized music generated from user-provided text prompts, reducing noise perception and enhancing acoustic experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental noises are often bothersome, and conventional acoustic masking techniques may require an excessive volume increase to be effective, especially when there is misalignment between the noise and the sound used for masking.

Method: The BNMusic framework consists of two stages: first, it synthesizes music based on user-provided text prompts that encapsulate the essence of the noise; second, it adaptively amplifies and aligns the generated music to reduce noise perception while preserving auditory quality.

Result: Experiments on datasets like MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate that BNMusic effectively blends environmental noise with rhythmically aligned and amplified music, making the noise less noticeable.

Conclusion: The BNMusic framework enhances acoustic experiences by successfully blending environmental noise into enjoyable, personalized music while minimizing its noticeability.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper is a tutorial that explores and demonstrates the practical applications of the Gittins index in decision-making under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception of the Gittins index as a purely theoretical concept by showcasing its practical applications and strong performance.

Method: The tutorial provides an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, followed by application case studies that highlight both optimal and suboptimal use cases.

Result: The Gittins index proves to be highly effective, delivering excellent performance in a wide spectrum of problems, including Bayesian optimization and minimizing tail latency in queues.

Conclusion: The Gittins index is not just a theoretical tool but also a valuable, practical decision-making algorithm with significant potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

### [458] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to automate intensity-modulated proton therapy replanning for head-and-neck cancer, showing improved efficiency and plan quality compared to manual approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical changes during head-and-neck cancer treatment can affect proton therapy quality, necessitating frequent replanning that is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Method: The authors developed a DRL framework using Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization techniques, personalized for each patient using their planning CT data and simulated anatomical changes.

Result: The DRL agents achieved higher plan quality scores compared to manual replanning, improving tumor coverage and better sparing organs-at-risk across diverse patient anatomical changes.

Conclusion: The study showcases the potential of DRL frameworks to efficiently address adaptive proton therapy challenges, offering a promising direction for offline and online adaptation in clinical settings.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAGIC, a modality-agnostic deep learning model for cardiac substructure segmentation, demonstrating effective multi-modal segmentation with substantial flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper lies in addressing the inefficiency and lack of generalizability of existing deep learning models in segmenting cardiac substructures across different imaging modalities and overlapping structures.

Method: The authors propose MAGIC, a model based on nnU-Net architecture with replicated encoding/decoding branches, trained using annotated cardiac substructure data from three modalities: Sim-CT, MR-Linac, and CCTA.

Result: MAGIC achieved average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 0.75, 0.68, and 0.80 across Sim-CT, MR-Linac, and CCTA modalities respectively, outperforming comparison models in 57% of cases.

Conclusion: MAGIC proves to be an effective, versatile, and computationally lightweight solution for multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation, enhancing the potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

### [461] [Synchronization for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10258)
*Satvik Maurya,Swamit Tannu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses synchronization issues in logical qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing using the surface code. It introduces three synchronization policies (Passive, Active, Hybrid), and shows how these reduce logical error rates and decoding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum Error Correction codes ensure reliable storage in logical qubits, crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Synchronizing qubit syndrome cycles is necessary to prevent desynchronization, but this process can increase errors.

Method: Three synchronization policies are proposed:
- Passive policy: Leading qubits idle until synchronization.
- Active policy: Gradual slowdown of leading qubits by adding short idle periods.
- Hybrid policy: Combines reduced synchronization slack and extra error correction rounds.

Result: Active policy reduces Logical Error Rate by up to 2.4x compared to Passive policy. Hybrid policy reduces Logical Error Rate by up to 3.4x. Synchronization improvements enable a decoding latency speedup of up to 2.2x under circuit-level noise.

Conclusion: Implementing synchronization policies significantly improves quantum error correction performance under the surface code, enhancing system reliability and computational speed for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical
qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface
code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate
for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the
surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,
thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the
production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the
use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.
Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits
involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow
down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,
thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.
  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define
three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the
baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they
are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the
Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by
inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces
the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The
Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the
synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction.
Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed
synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x
with a circuit-level noise model.

Motivation: To address VQC limitations, including limited expressivity, optimization issues, and sensitivity to quantum noise, and to create a more scalable, efficient, and robust quantum-classical model.

Method: The paper introduces VQC-MLPNet, utilizing quantum circuits for dynamic parameter generation for classical MLPs through amplitude encoding and quantum operations.

Result: VQC-MLPNet achieves exponential improvements in representation ability compared to standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid models, with robust empirical performance on tasks like charge state classification and genomic binding prediction under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The introduced VQC-MLPNet framework addresses VQC limitations and demonstrates both theoretical and practical advancements in quantum-enhanced learning, providing new possibilities for unconventional computing paradigms in the noisy quantum era.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.
